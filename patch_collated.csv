9.1,2019-01-08,"Welcome, one and all, to the first patch of 2019! We hope the holidays treated you well and you're rested up and ready for a fresh new year of League. Let's get into it! At the top of the notes you'll see a special section for Kalista, Ornn, and Sejuani, all of whom have been much stronger in pro play than regular play. In all three cases, we're reducing the utility they offer to coordinated teams and offering them strength that's less tied to perfect timing, positioning, or communication. From there, we move into the bulk of our champion changes which feature direct buffs to a bunch of marksmen. In each case, we accentuated the unique strengths or highest moments they're picked for, but the impetus for all of them is the same: Marksmen on the whole ended 2018 in a rough spot. We've got some item work in the patches to come as well, so 9.1 isn't the end of the road to recovery. After that, the balance updates wrap up with rune adjustments, including a usability buff to Hail of Blades for champs with attack resets. Best of luck in your matches on 9.1! When we say ""Kalista,"" League vets immediately think ""nerfed because of pro play."" It's been a minute since we've tried to shift her strength toward less team-coordination-dependent power, but we're taking a fresh stab at it here. Kalista's offensive strength is no longer tied to being near her Oathsworn and her ability to turn Rend into a better Smite is greatly diminished. In return, she's gaining a bunch of personal power she can use in any situation. While Ornn doesn't have as lengthy a track record of competitive problems as Kalista, he's similarly shown much stronger results in pro play. He has no losing matchups when strong, making him a safe choice in any comp, and his ult locks enemies down from a distance so allies can clean up the kill without Ornn actually having to do his job as a tank. We're reducing these strengths and investing that power into Ornn's passive. Switching to a free upgrade system gives Ornn a unique ability to jump-start the item scaling for both himself and his team: Rather than delaying progress toward full builds, upgrading an item is now pure upside. Third in our ""powerful in pro, weak in regular"" lineup is Sejuani. The broad angle of approach for these changes is ""reduce crowd control and increase damage"" to make Sejuani's success less dependent on ally follow-up (or set-up in the case of melee allies priming E). We're also reducing Frost Armor's massive spike of defenses to extend its duration and give Sejuani more baseline durability. This ties Sejuani's responsibility of soaking damage less to perfectly coordinated teamfight initiation, enabling her to better tank for her team throughout extended combat. We're adding some personal reward for Hawkshots that enable Ashe's team to lock down a kill. (The Q change is a quality of life improvement.) Helping Zap!'s cast time keep up with Jinx so casting it mid- or late-game doesn't feel like as much of a standstill. These changes make Katarina feel more responsive to play without stripping away her opponents' ability to react to her decisions. We're increasing the reward good Nasus players earn for prioritizing last-hits on big stuff. This doesn't affect stacks from smaller units, so the big dog's gotta land those cannons to make use of this buff. Plus 12! Buffing the dream Q that hits all five enemy champions in a teamfight. This is a spicy buff to Vayne's mid- and late-game teamfighting for players who can train enemies down during Final Hour without getting bopped in the process. To the Vaynes of the world: Vaynespotting is still a thing, so be careful not to roll yourself into an early grave. At the same time, don't be skittish—if you Tumble without attacking, you're barely going to get anything from this buff. We're upping Xayah's unique ability among marksmen to keep enemies where she wants them as she tosses and recalls her feathers. When preseason shipped, we pulled out the Monster Hunter gold penalty to see if other changes would naturally discourage gold funneling (higher tradeoff via turret plating, higher risk via minion and monster bounties). Funneling's made a small comeback, so we're adding a new version of Monster Hunter that's more graceful than last season's check on who had the highest CS. Part of the reason Hail of Blades historically struggled to find a niche is that if you were a champion who cares about attack speed, you usually wanted to go Precision instead. Rune stats solved this tension but left a second unaddressed: Champions who want to open fights with quick bursts of attacks have reset abilities that overlap with one of Hail's empowered attacks. We're changing Hail of Blades to synergize—rather than compete—with attack resets. Even attack speed-focused champs have been taking adaptive force in their the offensive slot, so we're buffing the attack speed rune stat to be more appealing. Celerity's established a stable of frequent users post-update: Hecarim, obviously, but Sivir, Aurelion Sol, and about a dozen more too. A slight buff will help it see situational use in the hands of others. Shield Bash is performing well for tanks thanks to its max health ratio, but we want it to be a good option for other shield users/recipients as well. The gist of these changes is that if you helped secure a turret takedown, you should get gold for doing so, even if you're not right next to it. This'll cover cases like a jungler going back to clearing or a low-health ally recalling in brush while their teammates finish the turret off. It also steepens the tradeoffs of funneling local gold into one player—allies will have to back off earlier to create sufficient distance, meaning the beneficiary will be left more vulnerable for a longer window as they try to solo the turret's remaining health down. While we were adjusting the local gold ranges, we also slightly expanded the existing radius to handle instances where a teammate is posturing to keep enemies from jumping on the player burning the turret down, rather than damaging the turret themselves. Pinging these abilities will now let your team know which targets are in range! These frequently requested ping improvements give teammates more relevant information. We're improving the way the HUD communicates remaining duration for a bunch of abilities, which were previously tracked only via the little icons in your buff bar. The breakdown below was based more on what felt right than on immutable rules, but let us know if there are other abilities you think should get this treatment!"
9.2,2019-01-23,"Hello everyone, and welcome to 9.2. This is our season start patch, and while it's a big one, it's pretty straightforward. Names we've heard way too often in recent months (Urgot, Ignite, Red Smite) are getting nerfs, while others we haven't heard in some time (Shyvana, Yorick, Sunfire Cape) are being buffed up. Remember: Knowledge is power, so make sure you're read up on 9.2's changes before charging into Ranked!Best of luck in your placements, Helping Sylas stretch his legs after being stuck in Demacian jail for so long. (He was weak so we're buffing him.) We overdid it on Galio's nerfs, but aren't keen on letting him anywhere close to his pre-9.2 state. Between E and Q, E is a much safer place to add power back. Your 2019 Ranked climb begins this patch. Here's a quick TL;DR of the changes this season: For a full rundown of this season's changes to Ranked (new tiers, season splits, position ranks, placements, and more), we've got a library of past Nexus posts at your disposal: After a rowdy month and a half of Bardle Royales, Battle Sledding, and Nexuses running it down mid, the Nexus Blitz queues shut down earlier this week. Thanks for playing—we'll be back with updates on our future plans a little further down the road! If you're looking for something new to scratch your fast-paced-game-mode itch, we've got something new coming down the pipe later this patch! Stay tuned. Sylas, the Unshackled, will break out during patch 9.2! Unlock the revolution with these links: Full-res splash art is available on League Displays! True to his nature as an unkillable ancient terror, Aatrox survived the nerfs we threw at him during preseason and is still savaging both pro and regular play. This patch, we're dropping his damage across the board (higher E cooldown means less reliability on Q) but are especially focusing on his early game. Aurelion Sol's Q, Starsurge, has always suffered from two points of frustration. First, while its reactivation delay plays a crucial role in Aurelion's vulnerability to all-ins, not being able to cast and immediately pop Q feels unintuitive. Second, the reward for landing a giant star from halfway across the map feels underwhelming. Scaling Starsurge's stun duration lets us address both issues without fully eliminating Aurelion's intended vulnerability to all-ins. Brand shells out too much safe damage just by landing a spell and backing off—he should need to more actively make risky, aggressive plays to find success. As a followup to the Noxious Blast nerf at the end of last year, we're reducing Miasma's effectiveness so Cassiopeia has to rely more on Twin Fang for damage. This forces her to get close to enemies, offering them an opportunity to fight back rather than melting helplessly from a distance. Galio underwent big changes at the end of last year with the goal of weakening his pro play strengths and amplifying his normal play strengths. With those mechanical shifts in place, he's now too strong at both levels of play, so we're going for raw power nerfs. Irelia's got a lot going on across her abilities, which makes her effective in an extremely broad range of team comps and scenarios. We're removing a few mechanics that weren't essential to her blade dancer combat style as well as reining in Bladesurge's late game insta-waveclear. Buffing Jarvan's clear speed as well as the unique aura he provides his team. Nerfing Jax's early game damage to slow his roll into a late-game raid boss and give enemies a wider window to beat him early. We're playing into Kassadin's anti-magic theme by opening up a weakness to physical-damage lane bullies. There's a lot of text below, but here's the gist: Unlock progress for Red and Blue Kayn are no longer separate (violence always gets you closer to transformation), and capitalizing on advantageous mid-game opportunities against one range type no longer risks undoing the work you did to unlock the other type first. If you still end up unlocking the form you don't want, now you can unlock the form you do want faster by continuing to fight the other range type. Giving Shadow Assassin Kayn a better shot at escaping sticky situations. We're playing up Neeko's clone baiting potential with Shapesplitter and trimming an extraneous strength from Pop Blossom (with an accompanying buff to keep the change net-neutral). When we took a mechanics pass on Ornn last patch, our intent was that he'd be slightly stronger overall. This isn't the case—in particular, players are struggling in lane without Bellows Breath's shield so we're giving him some more baseline tankiness. This patch's changes to Grand Entrance are a targeted nerf for Rakan's R-W initiation: The Quickness's speed boost made Grand Entrance's dash fast enough for Rakan to reliably charm enemies at the dash's end point, holding them in place for the knockup and—for coordinated teams—a truckload of follow-up damage from Rakan's allies. Slowing Grand Entrance's dash speed gives foes more time to react to Rakan's dive while reducing the delay before it pops keeps it effective when Rakan isn't trying to do fancy combos with it. Shyvana's been on the weak side for quite a while. We're buffing her unique dragon killing ability, as well as her ability to shred through tanky targets. This particular use case for Tahm Kench's ult was basically ""second Devour."" Chomping allies once a fight is enough, Tahm. It's time, Urgot. We're nerfing crab man's early game across a number of vectors to give other top laners a better chance at success. In some late-game situations, the delay between Excessive Force's empowered attack and Vi's next basic attack lasted long enough that Vi ended up losing sustained damage compared to just basic-attacking as normal. We're making that not a thing anymore. Given that Volibear, like other juggernauts, is often forced to fight whoever's up close and personal, we're changing Majestic Roar's bonus damage to be good against fighters and tanks, not just backline squishies. We're also taking the opportunity to make Thunder Claws feel snappier. Yorick's a lot stronger when The Maiden is with him, but he loses that strength if he doesn't stay in lane, leading to subpar contributions if he abandons a split-push to fight with his team. We're giving Yorick the ability to bring the Maiden and her Mist Walkers with him, roaming together as combat buddies or cross-lane turret demolitionists. Toss in a late-game increase to Mist Walker availability (especially when Yorick's allies don't let him last hit with Last Rites) and we've got a patch! Lower mana regen means Zyra will need to think twice before fishing for hits with Deadly Spines and Grasping Roots, lest she be caught out without resources during a gank or all-in. Quality of life changes and fixes. This one actually went live last patch, but we figured it's still worth a mention! Given you're typically trying to hit something on-screen or just off-screen with these abilities, we're disabling minimap targeting to avoid miscasts. Oblivion Orb is a ubiquitous mage pick-up due to the ability to stack its magic penetration with Sorcerer's Shoes relatively early in the game. That being the case, why didn't we nerf the magic penetration? We're shrinking Oblivion Orb's contribution toward ability ratios so it's less attractive for late-scaling mages while still satisfying to rush for champions with high base damages or are looking for an early power spike before moving onto main-build items. Like Oblivion Orb above, we want to push Morellonomicon a bit further toward its unique identity. In this case, that identity is the magic damage Grievous Wounds item. If the enemy team doesn't have significant sources of healing or regen, finishing Morellonomicon should be less attractive than sitting on Oblivion Orb and building something else. Despite its historical place in many tank and fighter builds, Sunfire Cape isn't showing up in many inventories these days. Making it cheaper provides earlier access to the full-powered Immolate effect, giving core users a leg up in lane and reopening the door to Sunfire builds for champs who've rotated onto other first items. Overheal's effectiveness relies on whether your allies know to... well... overheal you, which often isn't the case in solo queue. We're siphoning that coordinated play strength into more self-sufficiency, plus shifting the shield decay to the Bloodthirster model to make Overheal a more consistently rewarding defensive choice. The choice between Bloodline and Alacrity isn't all that exciting, with the majority of potential users simply defaulting to Alacrity without much thought. We're shifting Bloodline to be a stronger late game option, adding a new decision point on top of ""attack speed or lifesteal?"" Cut Down scales dramatically over game time due flat health differences being much narrower before level scaling and items kick in. Switching to a percent model makes it useful even in the early game, though the max bonus is going down to accommodate this increase in relevance. Absolute Focus is overtuned, particularly for champions who extract tons of PvE value from the bonus stats (marksmen, junglers). We're bringing its effectiveness down across the board. The adaptive damage stat has proven to be the best option in the offense row and especially the flex rows, so we're nerfing it. Buffs to the armor and magic resist rune will bring flex in line overall, with magic resist needing more of a leg up. While the individual buffs and nerfs here might look fiddly, a change in pick rates creates a far more noticeable effect: Champs who switch their flex from adaptive to armor or magic resist will lose ten damage, not one. Ignite's damage nerf should come as no surprise: it's been flooding summoner spell choices across multiple lanes. The cooldown buff may look confusing, but shifting power out of Ignite's burn into its uptime lets us swing harder on damage without killing the spell entirely. During preseason, we made Baron buff less mandatory for sieges (by buffing minions) to reduce the degree games revolve around it. We're following suit by weakening the combat strength early Barons offer to reduce the number of games that snowball off one good play into an abrupt end. On a similar note as Hand of Baron above, we're making base defenses more resilient to early sieges to avoid games falling into an unrecoverable state due to one good early push. Our preseason changes to camp experience didn't result in the jungler power and influence reduction we intended, so we're following up. We're reining in the kill pressure Challenging Smite grants junglers."
9.3,2019-02-05,"Welcome to 9.3, the patch that's like milk because we're alleviating a lot of spice. On the champion front, we're wrapping up mechanics cleanup on Aatrox, Akali, and Irelia to ensure they've got meaningful weaknesses opponents can capitalize on. Item-wise, we're taking a deep pass on marksman items to solve the build satisfaction issues marksmen have been frustrated by since midseason. We're also changing farm bounties so players who farm their way back from a deficit aren't treated the same as champs who ran away with huge CS leads to begin with. Grab a glass (of milk, remember?) and read on. Recent days have ushered in the ""Frostmancy"" strategy, where solo laners take Kleptomancy and Spellthief's Edge to harass their opponent with Tribute procs and maintain their income with Kleptomancy while ignoring last hitting. This strategy throws several laning skills out the window, erases the gold tradeoffs for missing last hits, and gives opponents no means of interfering with your plan. Similar to gold funneling last season, we're taking a heavy-handed approach to remove Frostmancy now while we work on a more refined long-term solution. Since this change hits some legitimate support decisions (ex. staying in lane while your carry recalls) we're increasing Tribute gold a bit to avoid big nerfs to Spellthief's' intended users. We're applying the same philosophy to Ancient Coin as well to avoid the risk that Frostmancy users simply rotate off Spellthief's onto Coin. Where last patch focused on dropping Aatrox's raw power, this patch focuses on exposing more weaknesses for the Darkin Blade. We're trading his ability to sustain off minions for higher baseline regen so he can't fall back as effectively on passive farming to recover from enemy aggression. Removing Umbral Dash's second charge makes Aatrox's skill check for landing all three Q hits steeper and means if enemies can bait his dash, he won't have a second one to use as an escape. First thing's first: We're removing Akali's ability to hide from turrets, which has been the most contentious part of her update. Many of you are asking why it took us half a year to get here, and the answer is that Akali depended on turret stealth to dive as effectively as other assassins. Ultimately, though, Akali has so many strengths (the ability to switch targets mid-fight without giving up kill pressure, and four forms of mobility, among others) that she doesn't need to also be a reliable turret diver. Given Akali finds better success in longer fights than other assassins, the short duration of turret dives make sense as a weakness, which they now are. The cooldown nerf is simpler: We're reducing Akali's late-game access to Shroud's defenses. With that out of the way... Five Point Strike nerf. Akali's become blind-pickable in higher echelons of play and Q's heal is a huge part of that: PvE sustain lets Akali survive matchups where she should be getting shoved out of lane if not outright dying to aggression. We're giving her more health regen to soften the blow, but are well aware it's a power-down overall. We'll be keeping a close eye on how Akali lands in both pro and regular play (did the W change reduce frustration? Did the Q change open up meaningful counters?) then decide on how to bring her back up. In the meantime, you can probably stop permabanning her. Camille's S-tier jungle status has gotten to the point where we can't easily balance her there without causing her top lane to suffer. We're making the call to prioritize Camille top going forward, though this likely makes Camille jungle a niche pick at best. Next verse, same as the first (well, we've actually been here twice in recent history). Cassiopeia is still too strong when fighting from extremely safe distances. This is a companion patch to 9.2 which removed extraneous mechanics from Irelia's kit and reduced her late-game waveclear. Our goal was to give her more pronounced weaknesses and make her less broadly powerful, which we're carrying forward to 9.3. Between the two patches, enemies should feel like they have better ways to deal with Irelia, from champ select to lane to teamfights. So what are we doing this patch? We're swapping Ionian Fervor's bonuses—now attack speed per stack, on-hit damage when fully stacked—to reduce the burstiness of her initiation combos and give enemies a wider window before her damage is fully online. (Bladesurge's minion damage is going up to offset the impact on her already-nerfed waveclear.) We're also changing Defiant Dance to a stronger anti-physical defense with no protection against magic damage to open a weakness to mages and AP assassins while strengthening her ability to counter AD threats. We've got per-item discussion in the sections below, but want to share some broader thoughts for those interested. Last midseason, we made a bunch of marksman item changes to broaden the range of champions and playstyles that could succeed in bot lane beyond late-game crit spam. While non-marksman carries do occasionally show up in bot lane now, crit marksmen were left frustrated by their builds due to things like crit overcapping, anti-synergy between Infinity Edge and Last Whisper, and higher damage tradeoffs than ever for defensive items due to a weaker two-item spike. This patch, we're revisiting marksman items with the following goals: Crit users are excited about their core build again Crit builds are generally more satisfying in normal play (fix the problems mentioned above) without becoming problematic in pro play Crit users can fit defense into their core builds if they need it Once the initial learning curve shakes out, crit users shouldn't be left remarkably stronger or weaker than before, though they'll once again spike at two items (Infinity Edge + Zeal item, with Phantom Dancer updated to be an appealing defensive Zeal upgrade) instead of three so their games will feel better. From here, we'll be following up on significant power shifts on a champ-by-champ basis rather than continuing to adjust the item system (barring any items that end up way out of line). This is only first because it'd be weird to see it in Infinity Edge and Essence Reaver otherwise. Welcome back, crit cloak. We're restoring Infinity Edge's synergy with itself to make it a more immediately gratifying pickup. Removing its true damage conversion means it no longer anti-synergizes with Last Whisper, while setting its crit damage bonus to 25% rather than the historic 50% lets us maintain our original goal of mitigating the late-game squishy melting marksmen used to achieve. While the Essence Flare version of Essence Reaver unlocked a few new marksman playstyles (mainly looking at you Lucian), it disenfranchised a bunch of others like Ashe and Xayah and ultimately ended up being a better fit for fighters like Renekton and Riven. Essence Reaver is going back to being a crit+CDR item. Per the Essence Reaver context, several champions make good use of Essence Flare. It's just that they're mostly not marksmen. We made a new item for them. (To those of you who saw the previous Spear of Shojin on Nexus Blitz, it ended up overlapping enough with Sterak's Gage that we decided not to move it forward.) Stormrazor was created to support marksman playstyles that focus more on kiting around a fight than attacking at full uptime, but ended up becoming the predominant first item in crit builds due to its combination of early impact and crit scaling. We're keeping the idea of ""occasionally super-powerful attacks"" but moving it from the crit system into the Energized system so it's not just a bumper on the front of Infinity Edge builds. Existing defensive options for crit marksmen (Maw of Malmortius, Guardian Angel, Mercurial Scimitar) set users far enough behind on core damage builds that they can't contribute carry-level damage in fights even though they're living longer. We're making Phantom Dancer a defensive option that fits more smoothly into crit builds. Shiv needed a little extra buff to bring it up to the level of the other Zeal upgrades. Making Last Whisper more effective as a component item while building into Lord Dominik's Regards or Mortal Reminder. We're changing a lot of marksman items this patch, which means marksman builds may look a bit different. We're sharing a few build archetypes you can expect to see this patch, though actual builds will look different from one champion to the next (unique builds aren't covered here—how's it going, Ezreal?). The best thing to do is, as always, think critically about which items fit your champion's playstyle and strengths. That said, here are a couple common builds you'll see this patch: This is a new section of the patch notes where we're gonna stick simple, straightforward changes—generally small handfuls of number tunings rather than mechanical adjustments or comprehensive balance passes. They still impact matchups and place in the meta, so this isn't a free pass to skip reading 'em! Much of Lissandra's status as a dominant midlaner comes from her ability to push into the enemy turret quickly and at relatively low cost, letting her consistently roam with plenty of mana to fight with. A higher cost on Ice Shard and lower damage on Glacial Path mean she'll have to invest more time and resources in mid before she can pressure other lanes. Separate from the waveclear changes, Glacial Path's endpoint indicator is now always visible if you're close to it. This is mainly targeted at cases where Liss players could hide their endpoint inside terrain, but we're addressing the brush and line-of-sight cases as well. Weakening Sion's early lane to make bad matchups more punshing for him. We took a light touch with last patch's mana regen nerf which asked Zyra to be a little more careful with her cooldowns. This patch swings harder by targeting her harass from plants which lets her keep opponents at bay even when she misses her abilities. One of the unintended side effects of preseason's minion and monster gold bounties is that farming back up from an early deficit puts a target on your back. We're making that not happen anymore. The loading screen's getting a visual refresh this patch to bring its look and feel in line with current League aesthetics and to lay the groundwork for new features down the road. Here are a few functional changes coming with the update"
9.18,2019-09-05,"Hey patch notes readers, want to form a contract with me? We're coming down to the final stretch! 9.19 will be the patch Worlds is played on, so we're adding in some changes that shouldn't rock the boat too much, but helps get us to place that encourages champion diversity and fun times during the most hype event of the year ~ With that in mind, in this patch we're taking another look at Aatrox and Akali specifically to make sure they don't completely dominate the meta, since they've been seeing high picks and play time in pro throughout the year. See you in another two weeks! But if you decide to die for the good of the universe, call me anytime. Aatrox is still highly valued in pro play, so we're taking another swing at him. We're nerfing his sustain and waveclear at the late laning phase points (around level 7-11) to hit his flexibility in lane matchups and his ability to flex into multiple roles. Similar to Aatrox, we're focusing our changes on Akali's pro presence, specifically in limiting her power before her level 11 spike. We're removing the stun on her R1 too to increase counterplay and open up the number of champions that can play against her. Ultimately, we think it's a good change for her in the long term. Giving Annie more pep in her step in lane with an additional benefit on her E so she can make more plays when on her own. Following up on the 9.17 changes and calibrating with a minor tweak now that his early lane phase has more counterplay. Bumping Caitlyn's early laning power so she can punish those who rely more on scaling. Our previous buffs to Ekko in 9.16 didn't go as far as we wanted. Nudging him towards a more aggressive playstyle with a higher payout and lower cost. Evelynn isn't overly weak at the moment, but we want her to more reliably take down her targets if she manages to get them under the execute threshold. We're giving Jhin a bit more oomph to better bully out greedy lanes. We're reducing Kai'Sa's consistent damage so she'll be more inclined to assassinate prime targets as opposed to mowing down the enemy charge one at a time. We feel good about the Kayle changes we made in 9.17, but she ended up slightly weaker than intended. We're buffing her E passive damage to make her basic attacks feel stronger throughout the game. Letting Lee Sin capitalize on early game successes with more powerful ultimates so he can have more of an impact. Miss Fortune's E is barely worth casting at its first rank when considering the trade-off in mana, so we're buffing it at the early ranks. Who knew Nunu & Willump would be so good at snowballing? Reducing some of their early gank potential as well as their scaling defenses, so they're not completely impenetrable once they get to a certain point. These changes should round out some of Teemo’s rougher edges. We're also making his shrooms more functional as the game progresses. Noting a bugfix in this section instead of the Bugfixes due to the change being a major buff to Warwick. At the highest levels of play, Xayah is an extremely safe and reliable choice due to her damage and safety in the early game. We're reducing the latter so that there's some tangible risk to picking her over other ADCs. Zoe's early lane phase is weaker than intended right now, so we're propping that up without increasing her one-shot burst. A few new options are now available under Video in the in-game settings. For players who need them, these options can be vital in making their gaming experience more comfortable or even possible! Please let us know what you think and what else you'd like to have options for since we're definitely interested in adding more accessibility features in the future."
9.19,2019-09-23,"GOOD GRIEF, WE'RE FINALLY HERE. It's the Worlds patch!! Similar to our philosophy for last year's Worlds patch, we've been making steady changes throughout the last few patches as to not completely throw everything in flux and have the pros invalidate whatever playbooks they've been developing for the most exciting event of the year. More than completely neutralizing top priority picks, we've been working on elevating more champions to competitive viability and are continuing that work in 9.19. This change process has resulted in smaller buffs or a couple of impactful nerfs across a slew of champions and more pro-focused changes that should even out the scales and create fun, diverse, and impactful picks for the next few weeks of Worlds games. On to the changes! We're reverting some of Sylas' nerfs! Since the combination of his armor and passive nerfs ended up being too much, we're pulling back on one of them. We overnerfed Aatrox in 9.18 and are giving back some of the waveclear he lost. We also overnerfed Akali in 9.18. With her ultimate now sufficiently gated, we're returning some of the damage. Following up on the 9.18 changes since we ended up going with a more conservative approach than necessary. Increasing Ashe's utility so she can be considered a good pick when a player wants to run down opponents in the early game. In addition, we're returning the full auto attack reset to her Q. We've decided that the minimal gameplay gains weren't worth the adverse effect on the satisfaction of playing Ashe. Blitzcrank is the Hook and should always be even as we release other champions who just happen to have hooks in their abilities alongside other things. Fiora's in an acceptable place when it comes to matchups in lane, but she struggles to convert her lane victories into game victories. Gragas has been dominating the pro meta for a while, so we're nerfing his clear speed. We're giving Graves some more reliable power via his base attack damage so he feels generally stronger at all points of a game. Also rounding out some other stats since we're here! Buffing Heimerdinger all-around since he's on the weaker side. Nerfing Karma's non-support damage so she isn't so strong as a blind pick generalist. Teams will now have to consider losing a considerable amount of damage if they want to pick her. Lightly buffing Mordekaiser in a way that might be most felt in pro games. Orianna is feeling generally weak right now so we're powering up her ultimate for the sweet wombo combos. Making Ornn's unique attributes happen earlier in the game. More follow-up post release on the stronk man. We're making Rek'Sai's auto attacks work the way players expect them along with some more durability. Our last few Riven changes didn't hit the results we were looking for, disproportionately weakening the players who are newer to her and don't have the same level of familiarity. We're trying again by reverting back to her pre-9.10 state and adding a simpler nerf to her E instead. Sejuani's damage is very high when considering all of the utility she has, especially in pro play. We're nerfing her dueling power and mid-game damage. Sion is unusually weak in skilled play. We're buffing his on-demand shielding, since this is more helpful in higher-level play. One of Sylas' main strengths lies in his generalist kit and high AoE power from his very reliable passive. This combination created no-fail situations which led to Sylas' 3-role, omnipresent, pro flex status. So basically, we're nerfing him so he's not 100% pick-ban at Worlds. Tahm Kench is one of the best champs for protecting teammates from being picked off by enemies, and he should therefore be more vulnerable to poke. Buffing TF in a way so he's better in the match-ups that favor him, but that preserve his existing vulnerabilities to ranged champions. Vayne is still a tad weak after the last round of buffs, so we’re giving her more late-game power. Despite Veigar's scaling nature, his contributions to teamfights struggle to keep pace with what's necessary in the late game, so we're buffing the ability that helps out the most in those situations. Xin could use some love after the Scuttler changes decreased his early game power value so we're helping out. Yuumi has been a fuzzy menace in the pro scene, so we're nerfing one of the more pro-impacting elements of her kit. With more value on his bloblets, Zac should be able to scale better into late game and feel more satisfaction in this unique part of his kit. We've removed ""The"" from some item names and descriptions!"
9.20,2019-10-07,"Hi. Happy almost 10-year!We're shipping some pretty big changes to Garen, Shaco, and Viktor this patch. Not big enough to be considered ""rework""-level lists, these larger changelists are meant to excite the players of these champions, freshen up their kits, and lessen common pain points that have developed. We want to also make sure we're hitting the identities players expect of them and give them more viable and exciting playstyles that should appeal to current, past, and, hopefully, future players. Other than that, we're keeping the scope of this one pretty small, as we move from focusing our work on Worlds-related preparations to finalizing changes and tuning for Preseason 2020. We like the extra range from 9.19 but think he's a little too strong right now. Making big changes to our resident good guy, namely removing the Villain mechanic on his ultimate. Disliked by both Garen players and their opponents, the mechanic wasn't making his gameplay healthier and took control from Garen when choosing his targets, frequently setting him up for failure.We're also cleaning up his passive and allowing him to gain Conqueror stacks, a Rune other juggernauts get. Garen should now feel more intuitive to play too and not so linear due to more options when considering items. Making Ivern more approachable (and stronger!) by not forcing him to get accustomed to multiple basic attack ranges. We're sharpening her niche as a bursty, engage mage while trying not to impact her pro-leaning power. Round and round we go! Pantheon remains a top-tier pick in more skilled games. We've decreased some of his early-game damage as it's more impactful in higher-skill ranked games. Also, a bugfix! We're hitting Qiyana's trade damage, especially after she hits level 3, since it is deceptively high and is making her oppressive in the early game. Shaco's playstyle and identity have both changed considerably post-rework, and the gameplay gains have been dubious at best. He should feel empowered to interact with enemies, especially in the early game, but struggles to do so. With these changes, we’re aiming to round out the amount of damage he deals throughout the game instead of having his damage centered around his late-game one-shot potential. Additionally, we want to support both the more common AD and the more niche AP Shaco builds as meaningfully different playstyles. So, we've changed E's damage type and moved some ratios around to encourage each build to play differently around their abilities. Giving Varus some general, reliable power. Giving Viktor some love by offering him more exciting Augments for his W and R, two abilities that are generally underpowered, and decreasing some of his mana dependency. Looking to broaden the uses of the Locket, especially in a meta where there are less AoE burst champions. The change will also apply to Circlet of the Iron Solari! As of 9.20, players will no longer be able to find and add friends through social media. When clicking on the ""Add Friends"" icon, there will no longer be an option to click on ""By Social Network"" and connect to your Facebook account to find friends."
9.21,2019-10-18,"Hi. Happy post-10-year! Did you get to catch the team's stream? We loved getting to answer your questions, play with some of you, and work on fixing some bugs that you outlined on the Boards. Thank you for interacting with us on that very special day. We hope you enjoyed all the amazing things coming to League of Legends soon, including the preseason changes we've been alluding to for the past couple of patches. The bulk of our time is going into preparing for the Rise of the Elements gameplay update, but some notable work going live this patch includes follow-ups to the champions that received bigger changes in 9.20. From all the past, present, and future writers of Patch Notes, thank you for making the last 10 years awesome. Here's to another 10 years of dumb jokes, obscure references, and ""CTRL+F __, no results?"" comments! No balance changes in this update, but we have some news for all you Golden Spatula wielders! We know that some of you were unable to play URF on the day it first turned on so we're extending it by one day! URF will officially turn off on November 10, 2019 at 03:00 GMT. We hope you've been enjoying it as much as we have! As promised, we'll be reacting more quickly to out-of-line champions during this iteration of URF! These changes are meant to bring a few of the highest and lowest win-rate champions towards the middle. We’re bringing back URF as a one-time experiment to celebrate League’s 10-year anniversary. From now until November 8, jump into cannons, wreak havoc, and rapid fire it up on Summoner's Rift. As promised in the /dev article on Nexus, we've implemented some balance changes, similar to the way we did them in ARAM earlier this year, to keep the games snappier and less ""solved."" Due to our extended testing window on PBE, we’ve been able to utilize a similar balancing approach to ARAM for URF, dialing in the approach specifically for the champions that really pop off. We’ve tried to make sure we adjusted champions in ways that do not hamper their classic URF patterns, while also not invalidating other champions as reasonable options. The changes below are the adjustments made from how each champ normally is on Summoner's Rift. To keep URF fast, we want objectives that are powerful and threaten the end of games. That being said, older iterations of URF would end too quickly once these objectives were taken. Additionally, turret plates are great for rewarding even small amounts of lane aggression in normal SR, but the tunings for that game mode often under-rewarded the risk it takes to hit turrets in URF, especially due to the speed at which enemies arrive back in lane. We’ve reduced the risk to get early plates, and we’ve dramatically increased the reward to make these a more interesting strategic option. Changes below are the system's values in this iteration of URF. We wanted to take a minimal change approach to runes, and tried to bring down only a few runes that really distorted the options last time URF was live. Similar to the system changes, the adjustments below are what they are now in this URF iteration. Nerfing Garen after his changes in 9.20. While this change might look large, we've kept the ratios the same, so it shouldn’t feel like a huge nerf. Both of Kayn's forms are underperforming right now, so we're adjusting his damage to give him a bit more oomph against champions, regardless of which form you choose. Right now, Kog'Maw's E does not feel rewarding to cast, even when it lands successfully. Rather than decreasing the costs on his E's or other abilities' early ranks, we're upping their value so that Kog'Maw’s kit still has a risk vs reward element. Lulu's transition into the mid-game could be better. We want Pix to offer more to fights and for players to make choices that are more worthwhile as Lulu scales. Maokai is underperforming across all levels of play and needs some help to keep up with his would-be lumberjacks. When Pyke gets ahead, he takes advantage of the situation without any real risk, killing off folks left and right and becoming near-impossible to take down. He should still have trouble escaping after an assassination, even if he's doing very well. And if he makes a second pass at a kill, he shouldn't be at near full life. Shaco landed in a strong spot after 9.20, so we're doing some light touch-ups to address specific concerns about his lane presence and early jungle power. Viktor is a little weaker than we expected after the changes last patch. We're going light on the follow-up, since we know people are still getting accustomed to him. We're also including a bugfix that already happened in a mid-patch update in 9.20, since we weren't able to widely message it out at the time! Warwick is falling behind the pack, especially when he maxes his Q before his W. We want him to still have the option of maxing out one over the other based on the situation, but they should both be on a more equal footing."
9.22,2019-11-02,"We're finally one patch away from preseason AND I CAN STOP SAYING ""IT'S ALMOST TIME FOR PRESEASON."" If you're struggling to get to Gold like I am, let this also be a warning that you only have this last patch to get there, so good luck! Meanwhile, URF ends in 5 days! That's right, 5 (if you include today)! If you missed the announcement on the Mid-Patch Updates in 9.21, we're extending the duration of the game mode for 1 more day. So get your cannon on until November 10, 2019 3:00 GMT. The bugfixes that we worked on with you during the 10-year anniversary are also going live this patch! You can read about them at the very bottom in its respective section. As a reminder to all you ladder-climbers, the Ranked season for Summoner's Rift will end on November 19 23:59 GMT! One-tricks, meta monsters, and Fill mains unite and get your last minute grind on for that Victorious Aatrox skin (if you're honor level 2 or above). Senna escapes from the lantern on November 10! We're nerfing Ashe's early game harass so she feels a little more compelled to capitalize on the slow rather than throwing it out mostly for harass damage. Blitzcrank is still a bit too strong after his recent changes, so we're giving him a light touch to get him to the state we envisioned for him. These bugfixes went live in 9.21, but we're noting them here for anyone who may have missed them! With this one change, we're hitting two birds with one stone. We're weakening Kai'Sa's late game isolated burst damage and bolstering her opponent's ability to push her away from minion waves in lane. While we've historically hesitated to put power into Kalista's proc damage due to high limits in team coordination in solo play, we're taking a different direction here and making the proc easier to access and amping the damage. We're hoping this will make it better value for her at all levels of play, and help with the perception that there should be no points in it at all. Decreasing Kayle's laning power so she's more vulnerable early and so it takes a bit longer before she starts bullying people around. We think Malphite's tank builds are in a good place, but AP Rock can be really frustrating to play against due to the low options of counterplay against it. So we're nerfing that specific aspect of his kit. Nautilus is too strong in all games, regardless of level, but we're focusing the nerf this patch on the damage that is more dependent on coordination. Pantheon persists as an overly strong (and banned) champion, especially in higher ranked games. We're making some changes to the parts of his kit that mostly impact players in those games, mainly targeting his consistent damage and wave clear. Helping Sejuani boar down on enemies and rewarding her for getting into the thick of the fight. We recently did some work to begin addressing the difference between Sylas' power level in pro versus solo queue. His overall power level dropped as a result, so we're giving him some general strength. However, we don't think we've entirely solved the issue, so we'll be continuing that work in the near future. We went through and adjusted the width of Thresh's E on all his models, since it was inaccurate and not the best representation of its hitbox! Nerfing Xayah's hypercarry DPS potential."
9.23,2019-11-19,"Welcome to preseason! Hope you're ready for some big shake-ups to Summoner's Rift, expansions and overhauls to multiple item systems, and major work to a bunch of keystones. In many respects this is our most ambitious preseason in years, and we're excited to see what new picks and strategies develop in a world where the map itself changes during the game. As usual, the next couple of months will be all about establishing and stabilizing the new meta as we head toward season start, so now's the time to jump in if you want to be ahead of the curve when ranked kicks off in the new year. On the ranked note, if you're looking to scratch your competitive itch, TFT's ranked season starts this patch. Warp on over to the Teamfight Tactics patch notes to get up to speed with what's going on in the Convergence. Best of luck in both your preseason matches and in making it through this wall of patch notes! Adjustments based on early data coming out of the Rise of the Elements and item changes for Preseason 2020. Pulsefire Thresh and Pulsefire Thresh Prestige Edition will be available on November 21, 2019. The 2019 season has drawn to a close, and we hope you reached your ranked goals this season. If you achieved Gold or higher in Summoner's Rift Ranked Solo or Flex, or Twisted Treeline Ranked, you've earned Victorious Aatrox. If you achieved Gold or higher in two of those queues, you've also earned a Victorious Aatrox chroma. All ranked rewards—icon, border, skin, and chroma—will be distributed during 9.23. This preseason, we're adding more game-to-game variety and opportunities for mastery to Summoner's Rift. After the second Elemental Drake of the game dies, the map will permanently transform to one of four Elemental Rifts, each with unique terrain changes that'll alter the way you take on teamfights, rotations, vision, and objective control. Elemental Rifts don't favor a specific team, so games are still in players' hands regardless of which one takes shape. We also wanted to ensure the Rifts feel intuitive even in your first game, so they don't introduce any new mechanics and terrain changes always occur in the same areas no matter which element spawns. New paths make opportunities for a quick flank or sidestep that your opponent isn't expecting. Extra tight spaces give opportunities for big AOE wombos and create some interesting new hiding spots with fog of war. Sneak around the jungle or look for a new ambush opportunity. Dodge skillshots or make a swift collapse on your enemies trying to sneak a far away objective. We're adding two new lane alcoves to the Rift, one in each side lane. We don't expect laning to fundamentally change as a result, but the extra terrain and its impact on line of sight should occasionally offer new playmaking opportunities through positioning, jukes, flanks, and ganks. New brush patches near the blue buff ramps into river add new strategic and tactical options as teams approach and contest objectives. Dragon Souls are a new end-game payoff for the team who wins the Elemental Drake game, a powerful reward that's similar to an Epic objective. Dragon Souls don't offer the same moment-to-moment strength as Baron or Elder buff, but they're permanent and an additional bonus on top of the drake stacks their bearers already earned. We're updating the buffs to be more equal in power and excitement. Stack for stack, elemental buffs are weaker than before to avoid excessively power creeping SR's buff ecosystem. With Dragon Souls adding new late game payout to Elemental Drakes, we're switching from the current frontloaded buff stacks back to a linear model. Last note: You can now get four stacks of an element if the enemy team gets the first two or three drakes (always different elements), then you get the next four (always the same element). Just a balance pass. Extra damage to objectives was a subtle-yet-powerful snowballing effect that was often hard to appreciate outside of coordinated play. We're switching Mountain to a more straightforward effect all players can play around. We're removing Ocean's mana regen to even its power out among users regardless of resource type. That gives us room to allow Ocean's healing to continue in combat, which is a buff for any user. Cloud's movement speed was powerful, but not all that exciting. We're moving the speed boost to Cloud's Elemental Rift (where we can support it with visuals) and adding a different kind of haste to Cloud's buff. With drake types going down to just one element after the Rift transforms, we're ensuring the first few you see don't double up on elements so you still experience a variety of drakes in each game. Since the Elemental Drake buffs are a bit weaker, we're dropping the health of the first two drakes. The battle over the Dragon Soul begins heating up after that, so drakes after the first two have more health to widen the opportunity for teams to contest. Up until now, Elder Dragon massively favored the team that was already ahead due to scaling with drake stacks (and in super long games, itself). We're removing that scaling to make room for power that's equally rewarding whether you're pressing a lead or making a comeback. Elder's new mechanic is an execute, sharpening its identity as the end-game teamfighting buff and making its impact much more obvious than the DoT and drake scaling it used to grant. Note that the 20% threshold looks higher than it is in practice: You'll rarely bring an enemy to exactly 19.9% before they go boom. We're standardizing the duration of Elder and Baron to three minutes. These buffs should last long enough for attacking teams to gain real advantages off coordinated power plays, but not so long that attackers come out ahead if they passively leave opponents stuck on defense for extended periods. If these duration changes make Elder too strong or Baron too weak, we'll adjust their effects accordingly. Final note about how often Elder will actually show up in games. In a complete stomp, the earliest Elder can spawn is 26:00 plus time spent in combat with the drakes. But in a game that's going even or isn't seeing many objectives taken, it's also possible for Elder to never spawn. We're standardizing the duration of Elder and Baron to three minutes. Though they have different strategic strengths, both buffs should last long enough for attacking teams to gain real advantages off coordinated power plays but not so long that defenders are paralyzed for excessive lengths of time. If these duration changes make Elder too strong or Baron too weak, we'll adjust their effects accordingly. Visuals for Blue Buff, Red Buff, Red Buff's burn effect, Hand of Baron, and Aspect of the Dragon (Elder Dragon buff) have all been updated. All monster buffs are now visually cohesive, including the new Dragon Souls. With the increased importance on drakes on bot side, we're spawning Rift Herald a bit earlier and letting her respawn once so teams don't completely abandon their top laners in favor of bot lane presence. (Y'know...more than they already do.) We're very lightly adjusting minion XP to slightly equalize the influence top and bot laners have on the game. Solo laners will level about 2% faster from minions, while duo laners (or solo laners getting non-stop jungler attention) will level about 2% slower. Put another way, every five waves adds up to an extra caster minion for solo laners and one fewer for bot. Divide evenly among the champions sharing XP. Slightly buffing Turret Plating durability to prevent group-and-push blowouts in the early game, especially with the Rift Herald changes in mind. Buffing DShield's regen to make it a stronger option in melee vs ranged matchups. We're incentivizing junglers to prioritize farming rather than just fitting camps in between ganks. Higher camp uptime ensures junglers have consistent access to gold and XP on their side of the map, and the removal of catchup XP steepens the cost of failed ganks. Since junglers will be able to clear their camps more frequently, we're reducing the gold and experience a full clear grants so they don't take over games. We're also ensuring both sides of the jungle get junglers to level 3 in their first clear. Though the item system currently has three Lethality options, AD assassins overwhelmingly favor Duskblade and Youmuu's and typically skip Edge of Night. This leads to a lot of same-ness in terms of how one game feels relative to the next for them. We're adding two new options and reworking Edge to give assassin players more ways to adapt their build to each game. We're taking away Duskblade's utility passive (Blackout) and giving it a bit more damage, making it the highest lethality and highest AD upgrade to Dirk. It's literally the same except for one quality of life buff. Still buy it if you want to go fast. We're only putting this here for ease of comparison. Edge of Night is the defensive Lethality option, but attaching that function to an active with a steep learning curve has made it ineffective for many aspiring assassins. We're switching Edge of Night's spell shield to a passive, making it more usable for a much wider skill range. This reliability incurs a damage cost: Edge of Night no longer grants extra AD or Lethality over its components, though we bumped its health to even things out overall. The first of our two new items. Sanguine Blade offers Duskblade-tier damage when you're hunting a lone enemy, but drops closer to Edge of Night levels if you're teamfighting. Go 1v1 somebody. Or 2v1 or 5v1, but where's the honor in that? The second Lethality addition, and the new home of the Blackout passive. Umbral Glaive's stats aren't too high, but it's also the cheapest Lethality item. Pick it up if you want to black out the enemy's map. That's why the passive is called Blackout. The item shop has a few component pieces whose passives disappear from their upgrades, and Serrated Dirk is one of them. These days we're not huge fans of that, since disappearing passives ask you to play around an effect that you lose access to as the game progresses. Since the lethality line's getting an overall power-up from the adaptability provided by new options, we're nerfing it by removing the disappearing passive from Dirk. We're refreshing support items to be less poachable by solo laners and have an expanded quest system that provides free, automatic upgrades, letting supports start the rest of their build earlier. (This should also lead to more build diversity between champs that use the same starter.) As a trade-off, Tribute no longer damages and Spoils of War no longer heals, so supports will have less impact in the early lane phase. At max tier, we've removed the Tribute/Spoils of War passives. Most of the gold these effects granted is still earned in the lower tiers and passive gold per 10 is up, so mid/late game economy is still buffed overall considering the gold made available by the free upgrades. We're also introducing AD equivalents of the items to broaden the cast of champs who can be played as support. At launch they'll basically be the same as the AP versions, but that symmetry may break down the road as we balance each item line individually. The magical-flavored aggressive line (with fancy new icons)! Tribute no longer deals damage, so Spellthief's users won't be contributing as much to early skirmishes. The new anti-poaching rule lets us rip out Tribute's nearby ally requirement and charge rate CS penalty. Tribute gold is buffed for Spellthief's but nerfed for Frostfang to maintain the time at which supports gain access to wards (given they can't pay to upgrade to Frostfang) but push the final upgrade later than when supports previously completed Remnant of the Watchers. Shard of True Ice's stats on top of the items purchased with freed-up transformation gold would've been too much of a buff. The physical-flavored aggressive line! The magical-flavored defensive line (also with new icons)! Spoils of War is losing its heal, meaning duos aren't going to have the same staying power in lane as they do now. That, however, allows us to grant ranged champs access to the minion execute. Like Tribute's gold values, we've standardized Spoils of War's charge rate to be slightly faster for Relic Shield but slower for Targon's Buckler. This preserves supports' access to wards at Tier 2 while maintaining the overall power progression of their item builds via a later Tier 3 upgrade. The physical-flavored defensive line! Where Spellthief's established itself as the aggressive support item line, Ancient Coin and Relic Shield overlapped in rewarding more defensive, attrition-based playstyles. With the switch toward allowing ranged champions to use Relic Shield, we're retiring the Ancient Coin line. We're sharpening Shurelya's into an engage/disengage tool that's specifically for enchanters—whose main function is buffing their allies—rather than leaving it as an ambiguous flex pick that mage supports can also spec into, given they've got items that help them peel for their team. (Tank supports have Righteous Glory, so all three support archetypes are covered.) We've struggled in the past to differentiate Energized builds from traditional crit, given that Statikk Shiv and Rapid Firecannon occupy both spaces and the only other Energized item is Stormrazor. This time, we're embracing the overlap and the goal of our changes is to make Energized a slightly more mid-game-oriented flavor of crit, rather than its own thing entirely. Energized is about the occasional massive hit rather than a non-stop barrage of consistently strong attacks. To that end, we're lowering the gap between how many procs users get from moving versus attacking—attack speed was giving drastically more procs, making hit-and-run playstyles too ineffective by comparison. One trend you'll notice in the items below is a simplification of individual item passives, particularly the ones that change how Energize behaves. Each item now adds just one additional effect—Stormrazor's slow, RFC's range, and Shiv's lightning—and proc damage has been standardized to a flat 120 on each item. All other mechanics changes have been removed or rolled into Energized's baseline functionality so each item can stand on its own, rather than require other Energized items to become fully effective. The absence of crit chance on Stormrazor was the biggest impediment toward Energized working as a crit variant. Adding it in means players can go for Energized builds without having to trade away their crit progression. Per the simplification note above, we've removed Stormrazor's amp on other Energized sources and sharpened its slow to a stronger, shorter effect that offers more play-around opportunities. We're leaving RFC's range increase as its defining feature and making its turret functionality baseline for Energized. Its charge rate increase is going away per our earlier comments on not wanting an Energized item's strength to be tied to how many other items in the system you own. Shiv still makes lightning, but we're removing the ability for lightning to crit. This is partially for that crit-vs-Energized split we've talked about already, but also because fully stacking Energized items (360 damage) gets you more power IE Shiv crits did previously (325 damage). Since this is still an early-to-midgame nerf, we're also folding Stormrazor's old bounce increase into Shiv's baseline. This is also a good time to remind you that Shiv no longer needs RFC to proc on turrets. We're making Kircheis Shard's Energized proc more powerful so it feels more like you're starting down the Energized path when you pick it up. It was already efficiently costed, though, so we had to bump its price up a bit. We're streamlining crit items down to one component. This is a slight nerf to build flexibility, particularly early-game, since Cloak requires more time spent farming before it can be picked up. The good news is we're buffing Cloak. It now gives the same amount of crit as a completed item, so if you need to hit the crit cap in a hurry, just layer a few of these on! (Probably don't do this, but the option's here if you want to experiment) Zeal's crit stats got a lot bigger from switching to Cloak of Agility. We dropped its attack speed a bit so we could avoid having to raise its cost too much to keep it balanced. With Zeal's crit going up, Phantom Dancer didn't have room for another crit component. When wielded by its most synergistic users, Shojin's unique passive reduced the downtime of their CC, mobility, and immunity spells beyond what we think leaves healthy room for counterplay. Zz'Rot enables split push strategies that don't involve enough champion interaction. We may revisit this type of strategic item in the future, but if we do it'll require more risk for wielders to use. Ohmwrecker's been underused and underpowered for a long time. Turret disabling is an interesting mechanic we think could have a place in League, but not one that potentially shows up in every team's toolkit, which is the risk a good version of Ohmwrecker presents. With the removal of Zz'Rot and Ohmwrecker, Raptor Cloak doesn't build into anything. Sorry, Darius. While these items were technically ""removed"" when we turned their respective modes off, we're removing them from the item set creator to make the tool easier to use. Kleptomancy was designed as a rune that (a) allowed users to build a gold advantage over opponents at the cost of the immediate power other keystones provide, and (b) created moment-to-moment changes in laning dynamics depending on what you got from procs. The experience Klepto created for opponents, however—be farmed for gold by constant harass damage—has been rough, especially for ranged vs melee matchups. Removing gold as an incentive only left the moment-to-moment dynamic changes as Klepto's design core, and League's consumable item system isn't deep enough to carry an entire keystone on its back. Sorry, Klepto—even for an Inspiration rune, you were too weird. Enter Omnistone, a keystone meant to be Kleptomancy's spiritual successor. Like the elixir portion of Klepto's design, Omnistone is about making use of what you've got in the moment. Relative to the individual keystones it offers, Omnistone's advantage is that users can rapidly cycle through keystones that otherwise have much longer cooldowns. Conqueror has been too effective at allowing sustained-damage fighters to deal with tanks, who have lost their place in solo lanes as a result. We're removing the true damage conversion and changing the heal to post-mitigation damage so Conqueror doesn't hard-counter tanks, but buffing its adaptive force to keep it strong. We're also changing up Conqueror's ranged/melee split so ranged users are a bit less disadvantaged (though Conqueror remains a melee-focused rune). Aftershock's flat resistances were eliminating a primary weakness of several ranged champions, forcing us to either balance the rune around edge case users (making it weak for its main audiences), or balance those edge case users around Aftershock (whose mains might not even like Aftershock's playstyle). We're reshaping this keystone back toward tanks and fighters, and will keep an eye on how former(?) ranged users fare in preseason. This rune's ult cooldown refund overlaps too much with Cloud Drake's new buff. Admittedly, so does Ultimate Hunter, but Hunter is usable by more champions and has a clearer goal, so it's the one that gets to stay. We're changing Presence of Mind to finally open it up to energy users and grant a resource pool increase (big brain getting bigger) rather than a partial ult reset. We turned Nimbus Cloak into Cloud Drake's Dragon Soul, so we're changing Nimbus Cloak to work off Summoner Spells instead. Senna launched pretty close to balanced, and we're waiting to see how she shapes up in the new preseason world before issuing buffs and nerfs. Alternate modes are the exception since most of our changes won't cross over into other maps, and Senna's definitely showing up too hard there. Twisted Treeline is officially retiring with 9.23. Thank you to every player who's made the Treeline their home over the years! Your rewards will be distributed during the patch. As a refresher: The Essence Emporium returns for preseason from November 25 to December 10! Spend your blue essence on icons, chromas, and more, including Emporium exclusives like the URFwick skin! We've made some updates to the True Damage skins based on feedback. Check them out in-game!"
9.24,2019-12-10,"Hello friends! It's the last patch of the year! As with most patches following a huge shakedown like Preseason, we have a lot of changes and tweaks in this patch after assessing some of the initial data and your general feedback. We've also already adjusted the knobs on the some of the new drakes, monsters, and pacing components of the game in 9.23 that we're including again here in case you missed it. And while this is technically the last patch of the year, you may see an end-of-year ""9.24b"" balance patch (a patch with no skins or features) based off of how the game is in a couple of weeks. There'll be a separate set of patch notes for that, so keep an eye out! Before we go, make sure to hold on to your poison because everyone's new favorite edgy boy (and his sister), Aphelios joins the Rift in 9.24! Following her Lunari brethren's release, Diana is also getting an overhaul to her kit, VFX, SFX, and ability icons to exude more of the moonly glow of her people. Last, but not least, Poro King is back for a limited time! Get your snowballs ready for more fun with everyone's favorite royal fluffball. Take this portal if you're looking for TFT's patch notes! We're still giving Aphelios time to settle in before deciding on any bigger changes, but it's clear that some things landed a little too strong. In particular, his Infernum-empowered ultimate is too easily attainable (and a bit too strong when attained!) and Calibrum-empowered marks are a bit too punishing for how reliable they can be, so we're going to pull back on those for now. This change already went live with 9.24, but we didn't include them in the original patch notes (as some of you may have noticed). Explaining the mechanic and subsequent change below since it could be a little bit confusing! Aphelios and Alune will find victory in the whispers of the moon in 9.24. High-res versions of Aphelios' splash arts are available on League Displays! This is a pro-facing specific change we're making since many pro players use this uniquely shaped hitbox to waveclear optimally, while most other players have a hard time accessing and utilizing it properly. Sad mummy is due for a buff given his state post-Preseason. Braum is a warden—a tanky champion that excels at protecting their allies. Most wardens are great at dealing with melee enemies that try to dive their backline, but bad at dealing with ranged opponents because of their limited range and mobility. However, Braum is an exception to this generalization due to his E, which makes him uniquely good at dealing with ranged threats as well. We don't want to remove the very thing that makes Braum unique, so we're leaning harder into it while lowering his ability to deal with melee champions relative to other wardens. This should then allow us to also buff him in other ways without having him stay as a default, safe pick in pro play. Some of you may already know that we've been working on changing up Diana's kit for awhile now. As promised, we've made some changes aimed at helping Diana’s pre-level-6 lane, and making both the playing as and against Diana experiences less of a feast or famine. By giving her access to Lunar Rush as a basic ability, we're unlocking one of Diana's core mechanics earlier and in the laning phase, allowing her to fight against and interact with enemies before she hits level 6. The change also allows her to effectively gank early as a jungler too, which is a massive increase to her effectiveness in that role. Additionally, Diana's new ultimate now significantly opens her up to more options as the game progresses, giving her both teamfight and skirmish capabilities that were previously inaccessible to her. This also adds a lot of variety to how she approaches fights, so her goal isn't always to nuke a single person with a full combo. Overall, the goal of these changes was to preserve what people loved about Diana while giving her both the tools and the variety that champions should have. We want Diana players to be comfortable with what they already know, but with a kit that may be more fun and rewarding for new Diana players as well. Garen is one of the biggest winners from the Conqueror changes, climbing well above our acceptable limits. As a result, builds relying on attack speed are dominating his itemization choices. While we wanted attack speed builds to be viable, we don't want glass cannon Garen to be the only Garen people build, so we're targeting that specific approach to increase build diversity. We're buffing Karma in a way that those who build more supportive items on her will appreciate. Kassadin is too strong at the moment, being good at both surviving lane and plowing through teamfights. Raising Rammus' influence in mid-game teamfights and his late game durability. Ryze's early damage and waveclear are too high for a scaling mage. We're also nerfing his best-performing rune (Conqueror), so some might call this the Riot special, but he deserved this change based on his Phase Rush performance as well. Senna is too powerful as both a support and ADC, but Senna in the latter role is especially strong. We're nerfing her this patch in ways that will affect both roles, but should affect her ADC role more. Specifically, we're targeting her safety, her poke and waveclear, and the amount of souls she gets in a game. All these changes should amount to non-overwhelming Senna, regardless of what role she's in. A small buff for Sivir! We're encouraging Yuumi to be the enchanter she was meant to be by buffing her supportive capabilities at the cost of damage (and that means Summon: Aery is a lot more optimal on her, not Arcane Comet). However, to access all her power, she'll have to sit on squishier champions instead of being an untargetable damage source on top of an already unkillable champion, like Garen. We're also asking her to sometimes expose herself to real danger by allowing attentive opponents to have actual kill threat on an unattached Yuumi. And seriously, we have the data. Yuumi is a really weird case where taking the wrong rune is negatively and drastically causing people to think she is worse than she actually is. Please take Aery instead of Comet! We improved gameplay readability on Lux's abilities while bringing them up to today's standards. Also, more rainbows! Conqueror is overperforming on a number of ranged champions, and is slightly too strong in general. We're making it last a shorter period of time, which hits ranged champions more since they're able to take full advantage of the long duration in lane, as well as directly nerfing the healing for ranged champions. We've adjusted Omnistone to be a little bit smarter at giving you the right Keystone at the right time. Below are some guidelines you can count on when taking Prototype: Omnistone. These were all documented as mid-patch updates for 9.23, but we wanted to include them in case you missed them! An early Rift Herald's charge damage currently feels underwhelming (usually less than 2 Turret Plates' worth of damage) and not all that worth fighting over. We're increasing Rift Herald's early damage so she's considered more of a high value get in the early game, but without boosting the second Herald's damage. Hold onto your biscuits! We're bringing back the regal and time-honored Poro King from his vacation on the shores of the fabled Ursine Lands and returning him to the Howling Abyss, where he'll help you earn glorious victory! Have fun with the giant furball until January 14, 2020 at 07:59 PM GMT. A quick TL;DR on one of our most dashing game modes: Summon the almighty Poro King with the help of your teammates by flinging poros, snowball-style, until you've hit ten targets. Once you do, the King will help push enemy towers, periodically heal you, and allow you to return to his side at any time. We’ve also got some QoL changes and updates from the last time the Poro King arose from his slumber. As mentioned above, every change that's applied to ARAM—be it a champion, item, or rune change—will also apply to Poro King! We're starting the transition from League of Legends accounts to Riot Accounts that'll cover League and future Riot games (more on the support page here). All usernames (NOT Summoner Names) have to be unique, regardless of server. This rule applies to new accounts, too. We know that these sorts of changes are never fun, but they are necessary to help update and improve Riot’s account system to support new games. If your account shares a username with an account in another region (including PBE), you should've already received a heads-up email (there are still some being sent out, so keep an eye out). Starting soon, you'll also see a dismissable pop-up when you log in, letting you know you'll need to pick a new username. Early next year, that pop-up will no longer be dismissable. When that happens, you'll have to change your username before you can play League. Here are a few tips:"
10.1,2020-01-07,"Welcome back, folks! Hope you had a wonderful holiday and are ready for more balance and League shenanigans in the big 2-0. We say hello to the big boss Sett this patch, as well as a huge update to Sylas, League's other resident bad boy. His changes mainly focus on encouraging his role as a midlaner, while making sure players don't lose out on that signature bruisery playstyle he's known for. Other than that, we have some QoL changes for Vi, Kog'Maw, Kassadin, and Jax, as well as some cautious buffs to champions that have proven to be menaces in pro play in the past. And finally, we're following up on our big support item changes during 9.23, tailoring them so that their users are encouraged to do more in the early game. Happy new year! Take this portal if you're looking for TFT's patch notes! The nerfs to Sylas are on-target directionally, but we overshot bit in terms of magnitude and are pulling back as a result. These changes are aimed at improving gameplay readability, bringing up Thresh's VFXs to modern day standards, and improving his overall thematic feel. Ranked 2020 begins on January 10, 4:00 AM! Prepare yourself for another year of competition, salt, joyous victories, and soul-crushing losses. Sett comes to reign supreme in 10.1. High-res versions of Sett's splash arts are available on League Displays! Infernum should be Aphelios’ best ultimate option when 3-5 enemies are standing on top of each other, but 'best' doesn't have to mean 1-shotting a whole team. We believe we can trim some damage and still retain its position as the best against stacked enemies, so we're doing just that. Aurelion Sol's wave control and enemy burst potential in the early lane is a bit too high right now. While we're quelling some of that damage in the early game, we still want to let him reach those high peaks later. With Conqueror nerfed and the fact that he's had low presence in pro play last year, we are being cautiously optimistic and giving Azir some buffs. Giving Corki some power in a place that won't greatly increase his early game waveclear, but will overall strengthen his niche as an ability-based marksman. Being cautious and optimistic with these buffs, like Azir, based on his low presence in pro play. Jayce is not in a good spot all across the board. With Kleptomancy gone, he's definitely seen better days and could use some help elsewhere. Fortunately, the Lethality buffs from the end of last year is helping a bit already, but we're also giving him back some of his more electrifying power and accentuating the burst he's known for. Kalista is still pretty weak after the buffs in 9.22, so this time we're buffing her survivability in the mid-late game in order to help her get damage out in skirmishes and teamfights. Being cautious and optimistic with these buffs, like Azir, based on her low presence in pro play. Kassadin is doing a little too well in mid-tier levels of play. We're nerfing his roaming and escape potential to target the players that go unpunished in lane and have the ability to be all over the place. For a juggernaut, Mordekaiser is too hard to get away from and kite. That coupled with his synergy with Rylai's makes it difficult to escape from him. Most enchanters are almost entirely designed to support their marksman and Nami's no exception. But we see the opportunity to broaden her utility a bit so that she can benefit both basic attacking marksmen and ability-based champions. We're happy with Sejuani's identity as a scaling tank, so we're doubling down on it and buffing her scaling capabilities, while leaving her early game vulnerabilities intact. For a dragon-killing dragon girl, Shyvana's been losing out on some of the new Rise of the Elements dragon interactions. We're fixing that and also giving her some small buffs to her sustained damage. Sylas has been difficult to stabilize for all brackets of players and has an extremely long record of changes since his release. Due to that, we promised that we'd do some bigger work on him outside of number tweaks that would help bring the gap between all levels of Sylas players closer. First, we're changing his early lane to be more in line with someone like Ekko and Fizz, champions that have less control in the early laning phase, but get stronger with levels. Secondly, we're balancing him as a midlaner and prioritizing changes that encourage him to be used there instead of other lanes. And finally, by removing his E>Q combo and slowing down his basic attack pattern, we're making a good faith effort to retain his auto-weaving bruiser playstyle while also making measures against the speed in which he bursts down his enemies. We'll be looking closely at him in the coming months to see how these changes have landed! Varus' role as a poke marksman has been quite weak since his last set of major changes in 2018. For an ability-based marksman, that playstyle should be one of, if not, his strongest, so we're specifically focusing on strengthening it. Giving Vi a QoL change to her ultimate, making it work more consistently against knock-ups and knockbacks and letting her stick to her target throughout the ability's duration. Zyra never had a reason to spawn multiple Vine Lashers since having one was the same as having two. But now that we made the Lashers' slow stackable, Zyra can plan her actions around the plants and actually think about which one she wants. We're following up on our big support item changes during 9.23, tailoring them so that their users are encouraged to do more in the early game in exchange for some combat stats. Tanky champions will be slightly more resilient and ability-casting champions will have more mana for abilities. Omnistone continues to significantly underperform, so we're giving it a buff so it has enough power to compete with the other choices."
10.2,2020-01-21,"Hi friends, what's up? How are your resolutions holding up? Do you really think you'll be able to get out of Silver this year? I hope so! Speaking of climbing the ladder, we encourage all of y'all to get your placements done sooner than later! Clash will be launching later this year, and we wouldn't want you to miss out on all the fun because you procrastinated (like your New Year resolution). Don't be like me, failing my last year's resolution to learn to watercolor because I ran out of time. This patch, we got follow up adjustments to Aphelios, nerfs to Qiyana and Nautilus, and buffs to Sona (yes, Sona, my main, my favorite champion, that's it). Jinx is also getting a change to her passive to let her be more.. Jinx-y and Rift Herald's doing her best to get more attention from you. Additionally, we've made some follow-up updates to the Elemental Rifts so they read clearer and are more defined overall. Infernal and Mountain Rifts, in particular, should feel clearer gameplay-wise and look more polished in its textures. And that's it for 10.2! Get your climbing on and see you in two weeks! Take this portal if you're looking for TFT's patch notes! Following up with a couple of more adjustments based on his performance since launch and how he's stacked up after the couple of bugfixes and changes at the start of the year. Draven seems to have come out of the item changes from Preseason a bit worse for wear. Jinx has always been a big fan of taking objectives. So increasing the list of things her passive procs off of is a very champion-resonant way to have more ""Jinx moments"" each game without massively increasing Jinx's actual power level. Helping out Karma's early ability to scrap against her opponents. Making Pix a lot more available and, therefore, useful, so Lulu can make best use of her best faerie friend. Nautilus is like that bully in high school that'd push your head in the toilet and almost drown you just because he can. Doing something about that so enemies aren't completely overwhelmed, especially early. Qiyana's strength in the jungle was making it difficult to keep her in check since she was such a reliable flex pick in pro play. We want to encourage her identity as a mid-laner and keep her from running amok in the woods. Sona has room for some buffs when you compare her to other enchanters. We nerfed her in the past to prevent double-support-item shenanigans, but since we've mitigated those concerns, we have the opportunity to give her a little tuning. This change will give her more of an opportunity to dodge skill shots and the ability to maneuver around the map and get to her allies. Trundle has been suffering all around, but especially when allies have to rely on him for ganks. We're giving Ziggs a stronger way to disrupt opponents and encourage a greater presence in the early game. The initial goal of buffing Cloak of Agility last year was to account for the fact that it was slightly underpowered for the gold cost. However, this has led to folks stacking Cloaks on crit champions, which also makes the decision between Cloak of Agility and Pickaxe more of a math problem than desired and doesn't help the average player measure how their lane went. A clearer item hierarchy is more helpful (B.F. Sword > Pickaxe > Cloak of Agility) when considering this key indicator of success. Frozen Heart is underperforming compared to other options for armor. We want it to be a go-to consideration when a champion is facing many physical threats. Nerfing Stormrazor as it's overperforming a tad, focusing on the tAD so it keeps its unique and impactful slow utility. Rift Herald takes a little too long to defeat, so teams lessen the priority on it compared to other objectives. We want her to get a little love too, so we're looking to lessen the gap between the pros and cons of killing her."
10.3,2020-02-04,"Hi friends! These patch notes are very big. Look at all our bugfixes. Look at Prestige Edition Senna. Look at the Akali work. Look at what they did to my girl. Look at the buffs to jungle! And maybe even most importantly, we got some amazing VFX updates this patch for some of our oldest and most beloved champions. Take this portal if you're looking for TFT's patch notes! As promised, we've done some major work on Akali that's going live this patch. These changes are the result of her presence in pro play and aim to trim power there more than for every day players. With that in mind, one of the biggest issues we wanted to tackle was the sheer number of options she had when approaching fights or surviving bad situations. She was way too flexible, being able to split push and teamfight, while also not being committed to a specific playstyle (early domination, scaling, etc.). Giving Aphelios some limitations so he's not shooting enemies all the way to the moon. The emperor has seen better days but has the risk of power-tripping, so we're cautiously buffing him. We want Corki's Special Delivery to be used more aggressively towards enemies, so we're helping incentivize that action. Mercury's in retrograde and that means nerfs to Diana. Specifically hitting jungle Ekko. Spoiler alert, we also have some jungle changes that'll give back some XP to junglers earlier in the game. MF outdated. Aphelios overrated. Long have you waited. No longer jebaited. Aiming to help out Galio players in normal skilled games who get more from the tornado element of his Q. Leona's damage is eclipsing her opponents' HP bars too much. Miss Fortune is doing well in all skill brackets, so we’re hitting her base stats instead of abilities that certain players utilize better than others. Cleaning up some stats to nice, clean whole numbers and pulling power out of his W defenses so he's not such a terror in the mid lane. Cautiously buffing Sejuani. We're also removing some elements to her passive that feel unintuitive for most players and aren't capitalized on. If we proactively remove it now, we'll have more room to buff her in the future since pro players won't exploit the safety it brings. While we love Senna's flexibility as both a marksman and support, she's a little too strong as the former. We're adjusting the Mist Wraith drop chances to support her role as a support (say that 5 times fast). Sett's been breaking some faces with ease. While stylish, he's not really getting put to the test. We're gonna give him the ol' 1-2 of nerfs, with a focus on making his Haymaker a challenge to get multiple rotations in a fight. Nobody puts baby girl in the corner… Actual context: Sona's new kicks have been showing off all over town. Pulling back a bit since she's slightly too fly. Unzoom zoom. No longer just a healbot (cats can't be trained to heel anyways). Her Q should be more worthwhile to cast even in the mid-late game. After the 2019 preseason jungle changes, we nerfed junglers through their EXP gain (they’re gaining around 40 EXP less per minute). As a result, we’re giving back around half the EXP we took out and pushing that into the jungler’s item specifically, so laners can’t co-opt it. Additionally, we’re making sure Krugs feel more worthwhile to kill, while still requiring the intended time for the reward trade-off. Finally, we are looking to address “the funnel strategy” by tightening the minion gold restriction further."
10.4,2020-02-18,"Hello to everyone except those who aren't my friend. Before we dive into the patch changes, a quick PSA-- patch 10.4 will not be going live until February 20 due to the holidays! In this patch, we're breaking top Sona and Soraka since they're grossly overpowered in the lane. Additionally, we're making larger changes to the jungle champion pool and giving some traditionally non-jungler champions better tools to do so if they want. This way, we're diversifying the arguably small champion pool for veteran and new players. And finally, we're making Aphelios a little easier to understand not just for the person playing him, but for his opponents too. Take this portal if you're looking for TFT's patch notes! These buffs, plus the Immolate changes (spoiler alert!) in 10.4 should help Amumu as he tries to play with the big boys. Aphelios is the galaxy brain marksman whose kit has a billion things you have to learn, but he's stressing out opponents who can't understand what he's doing and seems to be lacking adequate counter play at higher ranked games. Better clarity will lead to a drop in Aphelios' performance since opponents will more frequently make correct decisions, but we also threw some raw nerfs with a focus on making sure opponents have successful ways to catch him and beat him up. Like Sailor Star Maker during the time of Sailor Moon Stars, Aurelion Sol's ""Star Gentle Creator"" is a little weaker this patch. Sharpening (can you sharpen guns?) Caitlyn's early game harass potential since she's sitting in a pretty weak spot right now. Our goal is to bring back build diversity for Garen, specifically buffing his tankier builds while keeping his damage-oriented builds still viable. To that point, there is a change missing in this section that's included in the Jungle Champions section instead, so look below for that! Similar to Garen, we have a jungle Gnar-specific change which you could find in the Jungle Champions section. But generally, we're looking to power him up a little bit, specifically when he's Mega Gnar, since he's feeling a bit underwhelming even has a huge hulking monster. Jayce should now be able to cast more abilities to fend off his opponents. Buffing support Lux to give players the option to viably take her bot lane. Ok. Singed was pumped up on his plant-based potion before it was cool. While his healthy libations have been letting him conquer the top lane, we're going to make his triumphs a bit more risky by reducing his early tankiness. I don't play her top anyways. Chipping away at Soraka's top lane potency as she's the winningest top laner at the current moment. We also want to keep the impact on her support lane minimal as she’s not overperforming there. Sylas has been doing well after our large changes in 10.1 and we're less worried about him taking over pro games, so we can give him some more power. Udyr currently doesn't benefit at all from Cloud Drake so we're fixing that. One trend we've seen over the years is that new and low-MMR players pick jungle at a much lower rate than other positions—even when it's stronger than those other positions. For 10.4, we're approaching this problem by giving some popular champs at these skill levels better tools to jungle with, especially also because jungle has an arguably smaller champion pool than other positions. While players here will still have to contend with the learning curve of jungle as a position, they won't have to learn to play a new champion as well. All the changes below are to ability effectiveness against monsters to avoid accidental impacts to lane strength. As a caveat, we're investigating other solutions to help out jungle and the satisfaction of playing the role in the future too, so look forward to seeing more from us outside of these changes. These were all documented as mid-patch updates for 10.3, but we wanted to include them in case you missed them! Small buffs to Exhaust as well as readability improvements. Attempting to broaden Hail of Blades' use cases since it's currently taken specifically by junglers who can chain their CC abilities with their basic attacks. We've seen Bloodline all too often as the dominant pick for ADCs, especially in pro, all last year. We're slowing down all the Legend runes' stacking for minion farming vs. champion killing since Bloodline specifically relies on stacking up. And since pros get more of their stacks from farming than kills compared to everyone else, this should be most impactful at that level of play. Currently, a lot of players are taking Perfect Timing since it builds into core items on so many different types of champions (mages [Zhonya's], AD champs [Guardian's Angel], and tanks [Gargoyle Stoneplate]). Don't get us wrong, we are happy to see it, but there's much more satisfaction as a player and as a spectator when it's used aggressively rather than defensively. Attempting to broaden the rune since it's currently only being taken by ranged mages with extremely low cooldowns. These keystones are really hard to trigger at level 1. Getting some more satisfaction and activity out of Sunfire's pattern. We're making an adjustment to how slow resistance stacks on a champion to match Tenacity stacking. Now, slow resistance will stack multiplicatively instead of linearly. As an example of the change, two 30% slow resistance effects will now reduce slows by 51% rather than 60%. We've talked a bunch in the past months about the switch to globally unique Riot Accounts and usernames. Starting later in 10.4, you’ll need to use those unique Riot Accounts, since the region selector on the login screen will disappear. When you log in, you'll automatically be directed to the server associated with your account (so if you log in using your PBE account, you’ll be sent straight to PBE). You’ll also be able to change your language by going to the settings on the login screen (the little cog on the bottom right). Worth noting: if your account isn’t globally unique when this change goes through, you’re going to need to update it on this website before you log in to the game. We have a new crash handling system going live this patch which will automatically collect crash data to help diagnose issues. Crash reports help us improve the game because it alerts us when something goes wrong! You can opt out of the automatic crash reports collection by clicking the Settings (gear icon) in-client. There, look under General and toggle off the option. Thanks for helping us help you! Read more about Crash Reporting on the Player Support website."
10.5,2020-03-03,"Hi. This patch, we're addressing the ""zero-CS-top-lane"" problem in a more systematic way to squash similar situations in the future. Sona and Soraka were just the tip of the iceberg of the hypothetical ""zero-CS-top-lane"" playstyle, so we're making larger changes to the top lane that should remove such strategies from showing up in the future while also allowing games to be carried by those in that lane. Current pro play mainstays Ornn and Sett are also seeing some nerfs so that we're not constantly seeing folks getting rammed down and thrown around by these beefy dudes. We also have a second round of jungle champion changes to help slightly widen that pool. We also got some ARAM balance changes, as well as the initial release of Eternals! Like other features and content outside of Summoner's Rift, these types of content might not be for you and that's okay. So just do you. Play ARAM, try out Eternals, purchase skins-- or don't! Take this portal if you're looking for TFT's patch notes! Moo cow needs more milk. We're pulling back on some of the power we gave him in 10.4. After a history of Journeying under the radar, Bard has to be pulled back a bit due to how much he's succeeding at high levels of play. We're slightly reducing the impact of the Meeps' sweet chime music. A small nerf since he just barely hit our triggers. Graves has been weak for higher tier play, and middling for everyone else. Giving him back some of the Magic Resist we pulled off his E, as well as a buff aimed to help both his jungle and laning. The goal of these changes are to power up Kai'Sa as she evolves, especially as she starts to specialize in either AP or AD. However, there should also be more of a trade-off based on that evolution Smoothing out Kayn's transformation rules so he's not punished due to confusion or complexity. We're adding a slight buff to his catching ability too to overall make him easier to succeed with. We're putting some power back into Lissandra's (cold) bread and (frozen) butter ability, so enemies know they can't just eat them willy nilly. Giving Neeko some buffs for any situation, no matter what shape she takes. We're lowering his damage a bit and reverting a prior buff that we had originally put in to ram him back into pro play. The ram's now a little too aggressive and butting heads way too often. Wasn't actually ""ok."" like we thought. Pulling back some of the power from 10.4's buffs. While he's mostly showing off in the top lane, Sett is also showstoppingly strong in the jungle. Taking some swings to reduce power in both places. Sivir is on the weaker side across all games, so we're buffing her. We're reverting the mid-patch 10.4 changes since we decided to go forward with changes to the Tribute support question line, including Spellthief's Edge, in this patch. All in all, that should bring her back to respectable levels in her main lane and keep her out of top lane for good. When you try to cast an ability outside its max range, one of two things will happen: Either you'll walk into range and then cast the ability, or the ability will automatically cast at max range in that direction. We're changing the three abilities below to all follow the 'cast at max range' behavior based on how we see players (especially newer players) try to use them. In Syndra's case, this specifically makes her Q->E combo easier to pull off. While mains will need to relearn the feel for how these abilities cast at long ranges, our intent isn't to add or remove significant power. We'll follow up on these three if needed. Last patch's round of jungle champ pool changes went well—lots of players in the target skill range have been finding success trying the new picks out, without those picks also crushing the competition at higher parts of the ladder. Morde and Darius were the underperformers of the pack so we're giving them a bit more help. We're also adding Poppy to the mix: She's actually already a decently strong jungler in the hands of some players, so she just needs a slight bump. We're changing turret plating in a few ways toward the goal of making it a more appealing top-lane objective for solo melee pushers. Since plates take more damage from melee champs, most of the top lane roster will have an easier time downing them (and an easier time securing first turret gold as a result). Increasing Bulwark resistances means group pushes won't be as rewarding, with 'gank bot and set up for dragon' the most common group push case in lane phase. Higher gold value adds extra consequence to these changes. All said, the tradeoff for abandoning a lane and roaming will be literally more costly once 10.5 hits. To ranged readers: The second and third lines even out to you dealing the same damage to plating as you did before. We just didn't want to say ""turret plates take increased damage from melee champions"". Blade of the Ruined King has been out of fighter inventories for a while now. We're buffing it to be a luxury option for shredding through juggernauts and tanks. Increasing Ravenous Hydra's strength should open its appeal to more fighters and buff the ones who already pick it up. We're also making the Crescent active work as expected for those who have longer than 125 attack range. We're buffing Titanic Hydra's health scaling to increase the threat it presents in HP-heavy builds. Removing support items from being used in solo lanes. Removing support items from being used in solo lanes. Mobi's heavily increase the ability to snowball in higher ranked games, allowing very strong lanes to spread their leads easily and decreasing diversity in your shoe choices. We're making them a bit more of a premium boot to buy, instead of something you can easily get once you're in that position.

10.6,2020-03-17,"Hello children of the earth. In this patch, we welcome the arrival of the new, trickier Wukong, and an update to the matchmaking system so that less games have an unbalanced amount of Autofilled players. The details are a lot more interesting than the broad explanation I can give up here, so head below for all the info! We're also following up our last patch with a third round of jungle changes to non-jungle champions and a couple of additional system changes to continue helping top laners be more of a threat throughout the whole game. Take this portal if you're looking for TFT's patch notes! The Solo/Duo queue matchmaking system will now be less likely to create games where teams do not have the same number of autofilled players. It's no secret that having an autofilled player (or two) on your team while your opponents are all on their primary position feels rough. With this change, we're letting matches wait a little longer to try and put an autofilled player on both sides of the match (or, when possible, not autofill anyone). While we can't just get rid of autofill without making queue times skyrocket, this change should help make games with an autofilled player feel as fair as possible. We're also looking at a similar change that aims to make the number of premades on each team equal. In our first tests, the change worked pretty well in isolation. However, it ended up combining with the Autofill Parity changes in a really bad way that led to matches being made with more uneven MMR than we wanted. So we're tuning the Premade Balance system and hope to get it out to you in the near future. For right now, we're only making this change to Solo/Duo matchmaking because it can affect different queues in different ways. But if things continue going well, we'll look to expand the change to other queues soon. Making a small consistency change to Anivia's Iced debuff (the one that doubles the damage of her E) duration on her ultimate so that all forms of it in her kit apply it consistently. Aphelios continues to dominate pro play. We’re pulling more power out of the mechanics pro players tend to value higher than players at other tiers. Darius is crossing the line after all the top lane and fighter item work. We're giving him a light nerf, with an emphasis on making Apprehend an even more important strategic decision. We're buffing some of Draven's power in a way that experienced Draven players can capitalize on so he can muscle into higher-skilled levels of play. Garen's build diversity is up, but not quite where we want it to be, so we're nerfing some of the stats that continue to trend him more towards damage builds. He's also just really strong right now. We're encouraging Hecarim to take more risks with max-range engages. Last patch we smoothed out Kayn's orb gain, but his transformation times shifted back to later in the game. We're moving his average transformation times closer to where they used to be. Kindred is starving for some buffs. Since Lamb and Wolf have been a little weak as of late, we're giving them some sweet nutrition in the form of healing and scaling. Buffs primarily targeting support Morgana since her mid-lane is in a good place. We want to manage Ryze's presence in pro play and ensure he doesn't completely dominate players' pick line-ups, but his late game isn't as strong as it could be. Cementing him as the one of the kings of level 18 for the opportunities where games go that far. Support Senna is currently too strong, especially when she's paired with defensive tank champions. We're decreasing the value of Souls as well as their cadence so she can't just constantly harass her lane opponents—something she gets to do much more frequently when she has a tank to protect her. AD Shaco is just a bit too strong right now, so we’re aiming for a soft nerf. Putting some power back into Starcall now that the scourge of Soraka top is no longer threatening time and space we know it. Now there's a little more reason to stack your deck differently come late-game. With Purge being Urgot's go-to ability to max first, his other abilities can feel crummy to use. The small buffs to Urgot's CC potential will increase his combo reliability even through Tenacity and keep Urgot feeling like an Ur-God. Smol buffs for the smol boy. One of our primary goals of this update is to give Wukong more of that true trickster playstyle that it felt like he was missing. As a result, we're giving his combat pattern more versatility and ways to outplay his opponents. This monkey may finally be able to trick people instead of just one-shot whacking people with his staff. In addition, we want to power up his bruiser, top, and jungle builds, since his mid and assassin builds (while strong) did not feel as satisfying to play or play against. Also, something, something, 200+ years. We want to buff Xerath's more precise-sniper-oriented abilities to reward skilled Xerath players for mastering their aim. Continuing with a third round of changes to diversify and widen the jungle champion pool. You'll notice that Morgana is getting a specific change to have her be viable in the jungle along buffs to her main roles. We're monitoring the effect of these changes to assure that they're not overwhelmingly affecting anything at the higher rungs of the skill ladder while also confirming that they are in fact fostering more diverse picks. Funneling continues to be present in solo queue at all parts of the ladder. We're going harder on the restrictions so that laners are more motivated to keep their gold and XP. Those who are playing the lane as is and not funneling an ally will essentially never run into this condition. We're following up with our top lane changes from 10.5 with an additional set of changes for Death's Dance and Teleport. This combination should continue reinforcing our initial goals of helping top laners that are coming out of laning phase build carry items to be a threat throughout the game. The Teleport change should also shift some of its power as an excellent lane sustain tool to a more late-game splitting-and-flanking tool. As League of Legends evolves, players discover new metas and strategies, champions are changed, or items are reworked, added, or removed. During all the changing and adjusting, sometimes the Recommended Items get left behind and never updated to reflect all the other changes being made in the game. We did a pass to correct some simple mistakes or completely redo what is displayed in the shop, so that players have an accurate build that is easily accessible by everyone of all skill levels. (Note: this does not mean these are always the best build, but what a new player is most likely to succeed with) List of champions with major Recommended Items updates: Alistar, Ashe, Blitzcrank, Garen, Gragas, Ivern, Kai'sa, Kassadin, Kayn, Kindred, LeBlanc, Lee Sin, Leona, Lucian, Master Yi, Miss Fortune, Mordekaiser, Morgana, Olaf, Qiyana, Rakan, Renekton, Rengar, Riven, Rumble, Shaco, Sona, Swain, Syndra, Talon, Taric, Thresh, Varus, Vayne, Vel'koz, Warwick, Xerath, Xin Zhao, Zilean, Zoe, Zyra Our main navigation in the League Client has gotten pretty full with Teamfight Tactics and Clash finally live. We want to give it a little breathing room and at the same time make some usability improvements to the main navigation. As a result, we’re changing the Profile and Collection tabs to icons, similar to Loot and Store today. Through user testing, we’ve also found that players occasionally confuse the existing Loot and Store icons, so along with this change, in the 10.5 patch we changed the Loot icon to resemble crafting, and in this patch we’ve given the store icon a special visual treatment to help it stand out."
10.7,2020-03-31,"Hello my children, welcome to 10.7! First of all, we know we’ve been crowing about it for awhile, but now it’s finally here—the spookiest of all the scarecrows in the land is back! (and Tedrick is nowhere to be found…) We've also continued to work on matchmaking in Ranked Solo/Duo games by aiming to balance premade duos on both teams. Additionally, you'll see improvements to both One-For-All (champion and system changes) and ARAM (updated Weekly Free Rotations and champion balance changes). We hope you’re staying safe. Now let’s get into it! Take this portal if you're looking for TFT's patch notes! As we mentioned last patch, we've been working on some matchmaking improvements like Autofill Balance to make sure that each game of League feels as fair as possible. With this follow-up change, we'll be attempting to make sure that when one team in a Solo/Duo game has a duo, the other team should have one as well. This change will only be applying to Ranked Solo/Duo for right now. We’ll be looking into adding it to Flex and Normal games, but since premades can be of all different sizes in those modes, making them equivalent across teams can be much more complicated. Once we've had a chance to see these changes live, we'll try to expand to queues with different group sizes. The spooky scarecrow is ripping out brains in 10.7. Now with 100% more oogie and boogie. High-res versions of Fiddlesticks' updated splashes are available on League Displays! In an earlier patch, we adjusted Akali's ultimate so that its targeting was a little less free to access, creating a huge cost for what was previously an easy-to-pop-off ability. But using her ultimate is an important part of her gameplay satisfaction, so we're loosening the leash on it a bit now. Corki's been having fun since our last buff, but can still afford another small one, so we're back with round two—get ready for some package boogaloo. Galio’s been in a sad state, and we’ve been working on reigniting his essence as an anti-magic guardian. Our previous buffs didn’t seem to move the needle, so we’re trying something a bit more adventurous this time by giving him the ability to more effectively counter magic damage for both him and his team. Our man of the Vanguard soldiered through his 10.6 nerfs and has continued to overperform, especially in the mid lane. Taking another stab at him by lowering his early utility. Ivern got the short end of the stick with some of the more recent jungle system changes, and we’re not brushing that off. We’re attempting to give him back that power, and then some. Supercharged, superfly. We’re giving Kai’Sa more opportunities for late-game outplaying while also maintaining her takedown potential. We wanted to increase Nasus' utility since that's the quality that more experienced players value and can capitalize on. Midturne has gone from meme to nightmare and quite frankly, there’s enough spook with Fiddle in town. We’re cutting out some of Nocturne’s general power, focusing on letting his opponents attrition him out of lane and controlling his scale potential before going full on darkness. Riven has been struggling in the laning phase so we're hesitantly handing back a little power, as a treat, to give her a little more breathing room while farming. We all know Talon holds his blades close to his heart, but he's letting them go too often. We’re not taking them away from him, but he’s proving to be a menace in higher skilled play, where his early game waveclear allows him to roam far more and far earlier. This patch, we’re reducing his reliance on said blades so that he stays more in line (and in lane). Wukong has been outperforming our expectations after his mini rework in 10.6 despite our success at bringing his multiple positions closer in power to each other. We will continue to fine tune him as players master the rework. We wanted to spruce up our warrior of Demacia by upping his durability and endurance through difficult fights. Conditioning has been overperforming, particularly for tanks and fighters. It should be a little more costly to one's early power for what it gives in the late-game. Not only is it a fine choice for anyone, it’s mandatory for tanks and fighters, where it stands head and shoulders above any other single rune. Phase Rush remains suboptimal on melee champions, even for those who traditionally have opted into this kind of Keystone. Looking to make it more tempting for those folks. We hope you have all been enjoying One-For-All as a part of our Galaxies event! Based on feedback and data from PBE, we're making some balance changes that will hopefully make your One-For-Alls always a ball. This means general system changes as well as ARAM-style individual champion balance changes. We're updating the way free-to-play champions are chosen for ARAM. Before 10.7, the previous three Weekly Free Rotations were available to play in ARAM. Going forward, we're making the following 65 champions always free to play in ARAM: Aatrox, Ahri, Akali, Amumu, Annie, Ashe, Brand, Braum, Caitlyn, Cho'Gath, Darius, Draven, Ekko, Ezreal, Fiora, Fizz, Garen, Graves, Irelia, Janna, Jarvan IV, Jax, Jhin, Jinx, Karma, Karthus, Katarina, Kayle, Kha'Zix, LeBlanc, Lee Sin, Leona, Lucian, Lulu, Lux, Malphite, Maokai, Master Yi, Miss Fortune, Mordekaiser, Morgana, Nautilus, Nidalee, Pantheon, Pyke, Quinn, Renekton, Riven, Ryze, Sivir, Sona, Soraka, Thresh, Tristana, Tryndamere, Twisted Fate, Twitch, Varus, Vayne, Veigar, Vel'Koz, Vladimir, Wukong, Xayah, and Zed, in addition to the current Weekly Free Rotation. Doing things this way allows us to give ARAM players a broader and more consistent set of champions to pull from, as well as making the free-to-play pool easier to understand for new players. We hope you enjoy, and we'll catch you out on the Abyss!"
10.8,2020-04-14,"Hey all you cool Jeweled Protectors and Hushtails! This patch, we’ve got another follow-up to the funnel mechanics and a couple of wider jungle changes that should help with pacing, mainly around early game impact. We’re slightly reducing how much a gank will punish an enemy, and giving junglers a steadier stream of XP mid to late game. These adjustments should help you bounce back and stabilize from early setbacks. Alongside this, we're helping out players who aren't hyper-optimizing their jungle clearing, giving them some breathing room with extra sustain so they're not always punished for taking a a little too much damage from a Raptor. We're also adding a couple of QoL changes to things like champion ability timers to better indicate how much time you have on an ability's cast or empowerment and the Practice Tool. Be sure to check those out! Take this portal if you're looking for TFT's patch notes! Aphelios has continued to pull out the big guns as a pro dominant champion. We’re looking to attack his power curve as well as his ability to deal with the tanky front line threats that he more likely encounters in pro play. Strike quickly—now even quicker. Ashe has been weaker than we’d like, so we’re amping up her main DPS ability as frost-ing on the cake. We're upping some of Eve's damage to help her saunter her way through early skirmishes and the jungle more reliably. We're reeling in a bit of Kalista's power with a focus on her early game CC so that she can’t kite enemies as easily without backup, and has to rely more on her support for utility. We've been seeing Yi snowball too often, especially in average play, so we're nudging him back by pulling a little power out of his ult. We’re giving our Golem gal more oomph in her CC and utility so she can run more like clockwork. Cautiously giving Ryze some power while cleaning up some uneven stats. Trimming some power from Senna since players are continuing to get better with her. We’ve been seeing players rely on Sett’s W for its consistent early wave control, so we’re giving his enemies a bit of breathing room before he can, uh, set them straight. Star Guardians get a lot of mana. It's a thing. Loosening her restrictions on her aggressive output so she can have some more presence in lane. We're giving Tristana a bump up to help her core kit combo to continue razing her enemies throughout the game. We’re fixing some bugs to Disdain and giving him more opportunities to bring the fear. And death. And all that. We're looking to curb a bit of Varus' power while making sure both of his meta builds are still equally viable, so we decided to balance one of the tools in his kit that would balance across both versions without chaining him down. Buffing those sweet Bladecallers so Xayah can keep ruffling her enemies’ feathers. We saw some players request QoL changes for more abilities with reactivations/recasts, so we added more indicators to show recast ability timers. Our attempts at reducing the effectiveness of funnel have notably cut the playrate of the strategy, but it's still proving to be a successful one for those who continue to do it. We want to see if modifying our current levers work to further curb pairings like Master Yi and Taric's success. We're adjusting the potential teams have to snowball early to make sure that your games don't go wildly out of control as often and give teams more chances to participate in an even game. Kill experience coupled with Homeguards means that early kills are still very powerful, but they're not quite as game-ending as before. Shifting the type of kills to solo ones also help give individual agency, which is something we still want to promote, especially since we're seeing such a heavy skew towards shared kills. We understand these pacing changes may hurt the jungle more than other roles, but we're making sure that we put back power into places that make sense for the role. (Read below for more information on that) Junglers are appropriately influential as a role, but we want to reduce the perception that they have to have an aggressive early presence to be effective. Instead, we're giving them opportunities for more personal power through proper farming as the game progresses. We also want to make sure the jungle is accessible to players who can't kite perfectly or who don't have proper setups for the cutthroat role, so we're giving some extra sustain to people who fall critically low in the jungle, helping them stay alive when the going gets rough. We have a bunch of new Practice Tool cheats coming in for all your Gangplank-barrel-training endeavors and your get-better-at-CSing plans. Good luck! We added a Clash Award subtab to the Clash tab which allows players to now see all the Trophies, Banners, and Logos they've earned in Clash!"
10.9,2020-04-28,"Greetings, fellow gamers. Welcome to 10.9 and the last legs of Ranked Split! To begin with, we’re bringing champions like Nami and Karthus down a peg—we’ve been closely monitoring them for a while, and they’ve been standing out in their success, so we’re hoping this will shuffle them back in line. We're also looking to help out our friends in the top lane who didn’t benefit as much from recent buffs with some extra padding. Aside from these, we’re bringing some love to champions we’d like to see more of, like Lissandra and Quinn, and making another quick follow-up with Wukong. But don’t take it from me. Dive into the goodness below, and we’ll see you on the Rift! Take this portal if you're looking for TFT's patch notes! The Summoner Rift Ranked Split 1 rolls into Split 2 on Monday, May 4 at 07:59 BST. Last chance to grind out those Split Points for the exclusive Split 1 Aphelios summoner icon, Aphelios emote, and armor upgrade before the next split! Bard has been Journeying to a bunch of wins in the upper brackets of solo queue, so we’re reducing some of his roaming prowess to lower his overall utility. Our beast of the Void has been struggling in top lane, so we're buffing the ability that is specifically more utilized there, to boost him through his journey to tanky Chozilla. Just because he's a scary scarecrow with a scythe, doesn't mean Fiddlesticks can't be helpful to his buddies in lane. We're giving Fiddlesticks a little extra damage to his primary in-lane-as-a-support ability, so he can more adequately help out his partner in fights. Despite the previous buffs over the past year, Gnar's continued to feel underwhelming in average games. We're cautiously bringing up Mega Gnar’s potential for extended brawls, while keeping in mind his existing strength in other places. Shugi Shugi Shugit-em Karthus has been laying waste in the jungle, so we’re nudging him back in line by targeting his ability to get around the map, while avoiding collateral to mid Karthus as much as possible. Our last few adjustments to Kayn haven’t pulled him out of the shadows as we’d expected, so we're adding a dash of spice to his overall game impact, from ganks to duels. We're hoping that the addition of minion damage on his Q will give Kayn more positional flexibility, and that lower cooldowns and increased slows will help players capitalize on faster clearing and early skirmishes. Given the ice queen isn’t ever present in pro play anymore, and is still underperforming in all skill brackets, we’re pulling back on one of the harsher nerfs we gave her when she was dominating the pro spotlight. Nami’s been on the crest of a wave for a while now, so we're dampening some of her power by reducing some of the movement speed she ambiently grants to allies while keeping her identity of an empowered healer (and surfer) intact. It’s been a while since we’ve given this mighty bird lady some love, especially amidst our recent buffs to her melee peers in top lane. We’re focusing on her utility here instead of damage as a slight nod to the Sanguine Blade buff (spoiler alert), as we predict she'll be taking it more often after this. Trundle's been clobbering all his opponents, regardless of health or risk, especially in pro play. We're reigning in his ability to make others more vulnerable so he has to fight fairly more often. We’ve seen players quickly (and effectively) harness the power of Wukong’s rework, so we’re further calibrating the monkey to bring him back in line. Sanguine Blade hasn't seen much action lately, especially since it has a specific niche that not all game states call for. Coupled with its reduced effectiveness around allies, it can stand to be more generous with the stats it gives to the user. The Essence Emporium returns from April 30, 2020 to May 13, 2020! Spend your Blue Essence on exclusive icons, chromas, and skins. For this run, we are rolling out improvements to the popular Mystery Champie Icon Boxes. We kept all the things players love, but there are a few minor changes to the experience:"
10.10,2020-05-12,"Another patch! Who would've known! This patch, we're taking a gander at some old friends who have been struggling for a while—Udyr! Nidalee! Sivir! How we've missed you!—and readjusting a couple of offenders that have been toeing the line (hint: trees, daggers, and gems). Oh, and URF is back! Make sure you’re on this ultra rapidly, and we’ll see you there! Take this portal if you're looking for TFT's patch notes! Last week, we told players about our short and long term plans to address deliberate game-ruining behavior. Our proposed plans aren't meant to target those who are genuinely having a bad game, but those who decide that the game is over on their own and then spend their time trolling others instead of trying to play their best. The first of our short term plans is to adjust our Reporting and Punishment system. In 10.10, you should start to see more frequent ""Instant Feedback"" reports for disruptive behavior as we work on tweaking our behavioral systems. For more context, you can visit this article. We’re hop, skip, jumping to give Tibbers a buff to encourage Annie to bring him out to play more often. We’re also bringing up Molten Shield's damage reduction, which was left in a weak state after her mini-update in 9.18. Diana is a scourge for average and skilled play. While her ability to be aggressive in lane is intended, she isn't paying the appropriate cost of putting herself at risk. For a champion that’s kept weak for everyone else because of pro play, Irelia’s finally fallen to the low end of pro. Giving her a surge in the right direction. On the other hand, we’ve been consistently seeing our other blade gal on the higher end of balance, so we’re pulling back on her AP ratios. Katarina will need to be more razor sharp and have the AP to burst her enemies down. While Assassin form seems to be in the right spot, Rhaast benefited a touch too much, so we’re nerfing the utility specific to that side. Higher cooldowns means this fearless yordle and his less-than-fearless lizard will need to think twice before fishing for hooks in early levels. Putting a bit less pep in this pirate queen’s step. Maokai is at the top of top lane, but not dramatically so. Giving him a small nerf to nip this in the bud. We're looking to bring our huntress back on the prowl, so we’re (javelin) tossing Nidalee a bone by amping up her signature spell as she scales into late game. Empowering Sivir’s mana loop to encourage players to master the art of using her shield and commanding enemies to back off. This Starchild’s enemies are going to be seeing stars. We’re making Taric's survivability skew more towards his ability usage and reducing his defensive raw stats for himself and his linked ally. TF’s been dealt a weak hand, and he’s been getting lost in the shuffle. We’re stacking his deck by trimming some of the cost from his ult to move it back in line with his peers. We’re also bumping up his base stats to help his farming and early presence. This spirit walker has been walking a lonely road, since he's not performing particularly well anywhere. For someone who was historically one of the fastest champions in a foot race, he's fallen quite behind the curve. We're bumping up his base MS so he can bear down on prey, then rounding a couple other stats. URF returns in 10.10 on May 14! The experiment with pick-URF last year went well, with healthier engagement with the mode and with Summoner's Rift afterwards. We believe a part of that success can be attributed to the continuous mode-specific balance changes, so you'll see more adjustments below to help keep games nice and snappy. Happy URF-ing!"
10.11,2020-05-27,"Hello, my dear starchildren. Before we get into it, we want to remind everyone that this patch will be going out a day later than usual. You may have already noticed seeing that the patch notes were also a day later, but for more information on the patch release schedule at any given time, please be sure to check out this Player Support article.The storm has landed and while the wait's been unbearable, our bear is now here in his final form. We hope you were able to join the frenzy with Voli during our event in the Abyss! This patch, we wanted to make sure we did it right. We spent some long, dreary evenings in a cold room, huddled around one single candle, chanting away all semblance of cringe wordplay. Safely distanced, of course. So don’t fret, baby girls and boys. We got this.Running it down—we’ve got a couple tweaks here, from Fiddlesticks to Lux, but the real meat of the patch is focused on the Marksman class (yes, it’s here!). It’s clear that markspeople have been struggling for a while. Their squishiness makes it difficult to stay alive in lane, especially in the critical early phases of the game. To remedy this, we’re bringing some power back with a two-step dance: drawing up health stats, and boosting their late game mobility through some items we’ve amped up, so that players can still go for exciting plays without getting as punished for it. It also doesn’t hurt to have more pep in your step. With that being said, we wanted to take a closer look at marksman champions who can solo lane and aren’t as dependent on their supports (Lucian, Vayne, Tristana, Kalista). We wanted to give them an equal amount of power as their peers while making sure it wasn’t skewed towards their solo lanes, so we’ve distinguished other treats for these folks that more accurately hit the mark! So get on the Rift, where you can use all this knowledge to make your enemies see stars. And, you know, longer death timers. Take this portal if you're looking for TFT's patch notes! The battle-spirit of the Freljord arrives with more lightning and savage claws in 10.11! High-res versions of Volibear's updated splashes are available on League Displays! Adding what feels like a natural mechanic to Fiddlestick's Q passive to enforce his identity as the scariest scarecrow, while adding some general spookiness to boot. We're also throwing a bone to mid and top Fiddle players by increasing his waveclear since it's a bit hard to function as a laner with his current toolset. Giving Gangplank a bump in his AS so that he can play around faster barrel combos and potentially shoot for a Zeal item instead of other AD items—meaning more crits, more explosions, and more scraps while in melee range. Notably, this will also sharpen his Trinity Force spike. Graves has smoked out his enemies in higher levels of play, so we’re quickdrawing back some of his Lethality-based power by curtailing his AD ratio which will also affect his ability to heavily snowball in gold. This shouldn't affect his other builds as much, since they're less reliant on the additional damage, so we’re hoping this encourages players to try those out too for shooting off the legs of his enemies. Despite us making him more menacing in 10.6, Hecarim is still underwhelming at almost all levels of play. Giving him some extra clear power in the jungle and output for extended combat, while making sure not to creep his minion clearing power too much. Although we believe Battle Janna is her best approach to the lane, her harass is weathering her enemies a little too well. Trimming down this ferocious tempest’s poke a tad. As a non-Zeal marksman who is already relatively weaker than other marksman champions, we felt Kai'Sa warranted some special attention this patch outside of the aforementioned marksman changes. Our ray of sunshine has been struggling in both of her lanes in varying levels of games (all levels of play as a support and in high-elo as a mid-laner). With a longer slow, she'll hopefully feel more reliably powerful when casting out her combo and bring more utility to her team. Syndra is one of the strongest performing mid laners at the moment, and she’s usually seen as a relatively safe pick. We’re reducing access to her stun so that enemies can take advantage of her window of vulnerability while it’s down. Talon continues to be one of the most powerful mid laners in high-elo, often with an early Q max. We're carving out some of his sustain so he can’t stall out the early lane to reach his item spikes as trivially. The marksman class has major durability problems, especially in the early laning phase where their power feels heavily reliant on their supports. This has been causing issues in gameplay satisfaction since a marksman's strength relies on the length of time they're alive. By increasing their mobility (via items) and base health, we feel that ADCs won't be punished so aggressively when they fail and will still have a chance to bounce back and unlock their power in fights.That being said, we've heard your concerns about the bot lane marksman champions that can also solo lane like Lucian and Vayne. We're giving them a separate set of changes which you can find more details on below. We’ve also omitted Corki, Kindred, Quinn, Senna, and Graves due to having their primary playrate in other lanes, with the understanding that Senna may be considered for similar changes in the coming patches. Each champion listed below gets a similar base stats boost in their health and health growth. The following champs are getting more specific buffs due to their ability and playrate in solo lanes. We still think they have general satisfaction and power problems like the rest of their marksman brethren, but acknowledge that they need more tailored changes to address those issues and not just straight durability buffs. We're trying some smaller scope changes to champions whose ability VFX are generally fine, but could use some more clarity when it comes to their hitboxes. In Cassiopeia's case, it was difficult for both those playing her and her enemies to see the smoke particles on her Q and know the exact size of her ultimate. Both of these have been updated for more accuracy. Additionally, it was sometimes hard for Cassiopeia players to know which targets were Poisoned (and in turn, receive bonus damage from her E). So now, Cassiopeia will see a clearer indicator above her Poisoned targets' head. As a reminder to all those who purchased a Fluft icon this year, Rainbow Poro (and his new friends) will continue to bring color to the Rift and Abyss until June 30. Equip any of the seven icons to change your profile background and to run around in-game with a colorful Homeguard trail. Get your rainbows on! We're debuting this year's additions to the chroma lineups for Grey Warwick and Medieval Twitch! When you hit Honor 5 this season, your Honor Capsule will contain a token you can redeem for one of these new chromas if you already own the base skin.

10.12,2020-06-09,"Happy June! Y'all ready for a summer of fun (safely indoors on League?) This patch, we dipped our toe in the usual pool, adjusting some champions that have been standing out, some of whom have been in a rough spot (Akali, Brand, Viktor, Xayah). We're also carefully dialing down a few pro outliers, like Trundle and Varus, to a fairer middle ground in the scope of the game. Finally, we're pushing a few changes and smoothing out a couple bugs to our epic savage of a bear. But more noticeably, we've done a pass on some of our more underutilized and niche runes to broaden their use for more champions. Some felt just too unintuitive to really understand the benefits they were giving and some just felt too difficult to actively trigger for the maximum value. Hopefully, these changes will help players widen their horizons when it comes to picking runes that best suits their playstyle. We also went and did a similar check for Summoner Spells and found that Ghost was in the same boat as the affected runes. Now, those looking to be faster than a certain blue hedgehog might feel more compelled to ghost their other Summoner Spell options and check this one out for size. Take this portal if you're looking for TFT's patch notes! Akali’s full of cold steel and competitive potential, but we aren’t really seeing her in pro play yet. Since she’s normally limited by pro, we’re giving her some baseline effectiveness by boosting her bread-and-butter damage ability. Bringing up Brand’s mana restore in the hopes that it’ll punch up his mid lane status without pushing his power as a support over the line. We’re pushing this mid-favored lever way harder than ever before to see if it’s effective in making him viable there. This serpent has been embracing both top and bot with open arms, and we’re primarily aiming for these changes to scale back her prowess in those lanes. With that being said, we’re softening the nerf to mid lane Cass by subtly bumping up her magic resist defenses. Fiddlesticks reaped more benefits than we’d intended with our last set of buffs, so we’re trimming down his power around minion waves while taking care not to scare him off top lane. ADC Senna’s been in a weak spot since her last set of changes in 10.6, so we’re giving her more chances to redeem more benefits from farming. We've also fixed a bug that caused her to have longer auto windups while critting, which should significantly improve her crit itemization. Though we took some power out of his Subjugation, Trundle is still the top troll in competitive play. We’re aiming at reducing his safe escapes from sticky situations by toning down his early mobility. Also rounding some base stats out because those decimals are as ugly as he is. Varus' Lethality build is overtaking his other options, especially in pro play— and he’s just generally blighting his competition overall. This build makes him an early game powerhouse and we don’t want to take that away from him, so we’re tuning down his scaling so that he pays a fairer cost later in the game. Empowering Viktor’s mid-range dueling so that he doesn’t have to solely rely on his E to be effective. Since release, Voli has been underperforming in his top lane, especially in higher levels of play and even with the mid-patch updates from earlier this week. Which is fine in theory since his top lane is secondary to his primary role (jungle), but the difference is just a little too wide at the moment.So these additional changes focus on improving the fluidity of his ability casts and gameplay satisfaction, while also giving him some general baseline strength. Now, hitting abilities and outplaying your opponents should result in some tangible success (takedowns, successfully escaping, etc.) After dominating pro play for most of last season, Xayah’s been plucked from the top tiers. Buffing her R damage to reward more aggressive plays. Go on, ruffle some feathers! Yasuo has been outshining in bot while remaining rather lackluster in solo lanes, so we’re bringing up the cooldown on a spell that is the most effective there while giving him a little padding on his shield, since it’s easier for bot lane enemies to poke it down. We’re hoping these careful adjustments will reduce his power bot while impacting him less when he’s solo. Approach Velocity and Unflinching have very low pickrates and unintuitive functionality. The goal is to broaden them so more champions can use them, while also making them simpler so each rune is more understandable. Guardian is a powerful keystone that’s been largely unpicked and ignored, despite outperforming other keystones like Aery and Aftershock on individual champions. We’re zhuzzing it up by giving players more agency over when it triggers and sharpening its intended defensive output by replacing the movement speed buff with extra strength in the shield. Altogether, we’re aiming for this keystone to still have a similar power level despite these changes, but finessed in a way that is less frustrating and more reliable to play around with. Maybe it’s time to let your guard down with this one! While delivering on an excellent fantasy, Predator often loses sights on its prey by having a difficult cast paradigm and unintuitive optimizations. We’re attempting to broaden it from its niche role on a few junglers to making it more of a standard initiation option. QoL cooldown indicator change. Unflinching and Approach Velocity have very low pickrates and unintuitive functionality. The goal is to broaden them so more champions can use them, while also making them simpler so each rune is more understandable. Ghost has been a non-viable summoner for many champions for a long time now. Adding some power that emphasizes its strengths relative to other summoner spells with a sustained mobility effect for those using it aggressively. Pushing the terrain a bit further in their gameplay scope."
10.13,2020-06-23,"Hi! It's heating up outside, so we've got a pretty chill patch for you. This patch is mostly about reacting to balance outliers, so here we are after making the rounds: hopping up a particularly hoppy yordle, simmering down Syndra’s spheres, tapping up a blue-headed mage, and leashing a particularly literate cat. We also revisited a couple runes, specifically Conqueror and Guardian, which have been overperforming when compared to the other Keystones. We’re steering them back on course to provide a less supposedly obvious path to success and more playstyle diversity. Then we’ve brought some love to Kog’Maw and Nunu in areas that are a little less conventional to incentivize players to experiment with off-meta builds. Stay cool out there, and bring on a summer of spittle and snowballs! Take this portal if you're looking for TFT's patch notes! Aphelios has not waned with the moons—instead, he’s been a persistent star in professional play. We’re toning down his overwhelming strength in objective control and his formidable contributions to fights from a safe distance in later stages of the game. Our snaky lady didn't lose quite as much as we'd have liked last patch, so we're walking (slithering?) back some changes. Bundled with the Conqueror changes, we’re hoping this follow-up will help Cass shed her skin. Carefully nudging Mini Gnar in the right direction. We think his attack speed is a safe lever to bring up since he’s been struggling with a much wider range of fighter matchups Whether she's wreaking havoc in top lane or jumping around in her standard bot lane carry role, Kalista is an imposing force in pro play. We want this change to encourage players to rely more on her early power and will also take away some of her level scaling so she doesn’t gain as much from soaking up XP from side lanes. Although his standard build has been doing well, AP Kog’Maw hasn’t been oozing much confidence recently. We’re bringing some enzymatic excitement for players to experiment with alternative builds around his AP. Even with the specific marksman buffs he received earlier, Lucian’s been in a weak spot in the bot lane, mainly due to the fact that he’s often outranged by his enemies. Buffing his ability range so that he can dash back to the path of vengeance. Midturne, Topturne, Laneturne are all outpacing Junglturne in terms of effectiveness by a decent margin. We’re giving Nocturne more tools to clear out his camps quicker and hopefully bring his roles closer in power. Just like with Kog’Maw, we’re throwing the boy and his yeti some ability power to empower their alternative builds. This way to adventure! (Willump noises) We’d like to make Ornn less of an easy blind pick in pro, so we’re knocking down his early item sustain to decrease his safety in lane. With a W that packs a bit more punch, Rakan can use this to play a more aggressive game while majestically dancing it out. Cautiously bringing up Ryze’s magic durability and damage so that he can rise up against his enemies in lane and get that last blast on pesky minions. Following up from patch 10.11, we’re continuing to adjust Syndra’s power as we specifically target pro-facing changes. We're pulling out some sustained usage of Syndra's Q at early levels so she can't whittle down waves and champions as comfortably. Don't worry, though—the power is still hers to command. Vi has been struggling to keep up with other junglers, so we're punching up her… punch! We’re hoping this will enforce her position as a mobile disruptor. Making it so the Maiden leashes more responsively when Yorick exits a fight. We suspect this will be a small amount of power that skews towards the upper echelons of play where Yorick is currently weak. We have nothing but love for felines here, but this cat’s E costs are currently too easily solved with systemic mana increases. We’re afraid this chapter needs to be shut. We’re happy with Conqueror’s current standing: a Keystone players gravitate to for elongated fights and utility for healing and DPS. That being said, we’ve been seeing the rune bleed into other archetypes and overrule its peers like Electrocute. As a result, we wanted to fine-tune the rune in a modest way where it maintained its intended strengths, so we’re shaving off some power to open up Keystone selection for a number of champions. Guardian is overperforming after its recent buffs to consistency. Bringing the base shield value down back to before it was buffed. Death's Dance has been overperforming on ranged champions, although we think its utility as a defensive measure should still be within reach. Looking to tone down the effect on ranged champions to open up builds while still leaving the item as a viable option. During patches 10.13 and 10.14, we're testing two new features to address game-ruining behavior in Champ Select. North America and Korea are up first, with other regions joining later during the test window. We've got an article explaining how these features work, but here's the quick version:"
10.14,2020-07-07,"The June gloom has come and gone, and here we are with sunny skies and 10.14! This patch, we’re here to teeter those who have been tottering, like Alistar, Kha’Zix, and Sejuani. We’re also adding an extra dash of spice (or more specifically, shadow) to a dashing assassin and shaking things up with a ferocious fighter and her blade. There’s also been some calibrations to champions who have been consistently turning up on the (pro) scene, like Trundle and Varus, to give their peers more elbow room to take on the stage. As a result, we’re also giving special attention to a bloody beast from the belly of Bilgewater and adding more bang for his buck in the botlane (say that three times fast). Last but not least, you may have also noticed that we've updated the Patch Highlights, an image we use to summarize all the biggest changes in a patch. Per the goals laid out in our latest Balance Framework Update, we're getting folks more informed and aware of our thinking when it comes to balance so we added more context like a key with roles and skillbands. What better place to add this information to than the image with all the important updates in any given patch. Let us know what you think! Now go on, run your way through the rest of this patch, out on the Rift, and down your lane! We’ll see ya at the next, uh, rundown.Take this portal if you're looking for TFT's patch notes! Strengthening this mighty minotaur’s disruption in extended fights by giving him more opportunities to use his fearsome fists. Ezreal is a bit too safe in lane and in mid and late game skirmishes for the amount of damage he puts out, so we’re reducing his ability to continuously evade attackers. We’re bringing up his cooldown but not drastically so— he still has the potential to get in a second E, but will have to be careful in playing around that vulnerability. Slinging more death over to the deathsinger by targeting his two main roles. With Jungle Karthus, we’re shifting some of his power against monsters to enemy champions so he feels less farming-focused. This also means the power we’re bringing to Karthus will bring some spirit back to mid lane Karthus by increasing early survivability and increasing his DPS across the board, so that he feels better equipped to lane against his peers. And as a cherry on top, we’re cleaning up E to feel more responsive and intuitive. We’re sharpening the claws on this bug. He's on the low end of power for Average and Skilled players, and we think a small buff can push him into a balanced spot for elite players as well. Change is good, after all. Aiming to pull this bloody beast away from the mid lane and boost his role as a support. As a slippery assassin, he was getting too much leeway while diving in and around his enemies. Mid Pyke is also far more capable of soaking up experience than in the bot lane. To curb these advantages, we’re bumping his armor scaling down from the literal best in class to a notch below and pulling back on his swift stalking around the map. These changes should primarily be felt in the mid lane, where Pyke accesses his later W levels much earlier to speed up his roam. In addition, we’re pumping more power into his Q so that he can fish for hooks with less punishment and harpoon it out more in the botlane. Due to current meta builds that simply don’t align with Riven’s playstyle, her depth and breadth of play has been suffering, and she’s been feeling a bit… exiled. We’re bringing back her edge by buffing more damage-focused Riven builds (think Essence Reaver, Youmuu’s, and Bloodthirster) over the current tankier meta ones (like Cleaver and Death’s Dance). We've kept it cool when looking at Sejuani and Bristle due to their propensity to take over pro play. While we're still hesitant about letting them run amok, we’re letting them chill out and defrost by amping up her damage output. This treacherous troll has been on a particularly savage streak as he continues to tear through professional play. We’re reverting the patch 9.6 buff in the hopes that this will ice down his early game clear speed and dueling prowess. Along with the Troll King, Varus is also stifling pro play as the go-to blind pick (or first red side ban). Targeting his early poke to make him less effective at bullying his peers out of lane. This thundering beast has been in a relentless frenzy, specifically in the jungle in the average skill group. Pulling back his power in a way that will balance his clear speed and sustain as he continues to storm through the jungle. Wukong is a bit on the stronger side, so we’re toning down some of the AoE disruption he brings to teamfights before he spins out of control. We’re bringing Zed out of the shadows to bring up his higher elo power in an exciting way that gives him higher consistency in his combos and more outplay potential. Yeah, you heard us—with the landscape of the game changing drastically from season 3, we’re reverting his W speed nerf all the way back from patch 3.13 and increasing its accessibility. This should make his combos feel smoother and stronger and open more windows for shuriken shenanigans. Predator is still weaker than expected, so we’re continuing our fine tuning. Giving it some boosts to help it compete with other keystones. Our changes to Ghost in patch 10.12 ended up being a small nerf with its increased cooldown, so we’re following up with a buff to speedily move it in the right direction. We're running a special one-weekend Clash tournament July 11-12, with extra prizes for Premium Ticket entries and a streamlined VP reward track. Full details here!"
10.15,2020-07-21,"Hi, we’re so happy you’re here! This patch, we welcome the arrival of the Spirit Blossom Festival, first with the entrance of Lillia, our brave guardian from Ionia, and then the return of Nexus Blitz (oh yes, it’s back!), all set in an ethereal realm of wondrous magic and bloom. Then, greetings to a refreshed Swain! We’re hoping these spicy changes (higher cast cadence and huge bump up in range) will fire up his power both as a mid laner and support. We’ve also taken another pass at Aphelios to tone down his dominance and fine-tune the synergy of his Flamethrower with Runaan’s. For the rest of our changelist, we’ve made some Pro-targeted adjustments to champions like Shen and Lee Sin to encourage more diversity in their lanes, while also nudging old friends like Caitlin and Gragas back onto the scene. In addition, we’re giving some folks a couple visual changes and audio fixes, focusing on champions with effects that have become outdated in comparison to their newer peers. Oh, and one more thing— we’ve brought more flex into Flex queue by lifting rank restrictions! We know, we’re just flexing at this point. Now, go forth. It’s your time to blossom. Take this portal if you're looking for TFT's patch notes! With the introduction of Clash and its unrestricted rank system for full teams of 5, we’ve decided to apply the same approach to Ranked Flex queues, allowing players to get in ranked games with their Bronze buddies, Challenger chums, or whoever! Similar to Clash, the system will use a weighted average that leans more towards higher skill players, so be warned before attempting to drag your Bronze friends through Diamond-level games. Have fun! Lillia prances into action in patch 10.15! High-res versions of Lillia's splashes are available on League Displays! Lowering Crescendum turret's attack range so it provides less zone control, and slowing down its target acquisition speed so opponents can reactively play around it. The rest of the changes are aimed towards weakening Infernum’s synergy with Runaan’s Hurricane. Caitlyn has been out of the meta in Pro play for a very long time, and we expect her to be a reasonable fit with and against certain meta compositions. These changes should help bring her back as one of the premier early game marksmen. Tank Fiddle has been spooking opponents top lane, outperforming other builds (specifically AP Fiddle), and frustrating players who run into it. We don’t want to terrify the tank off the scarecrow, but with Jungle Fiddle being in a good spot, we’re hoping these changes will encourage players to indulge in the bounty of Fiddle as a mage, first and foremost. Aiming to rouse this liquor connoisseur to step into his role as an AP mage who can both engage fights and burst down enemies, so we’re sharpening his late-game damage. Our bladed dancer has been falling off in extended games at all levels of play, especially in Average MMR. Cautiously strengthening her scaling and dueling potential to help bridge the gap between laning phase to mid game. We can’t turn a blind eye to the fact that Lee has been a consistent threat in Elite and Pro play, so we’re increasing the cooldown on one of Lee's more reliable spells to curb his mobility and sustain throughout the game. Slightly taming the fire on this forger so that his enemies have more opportunities to trade back. We’re making Rakan’s progression across the course of a game feel smoother. This is a quality-of-life change that is also a very minor buff for this saucy showman. We’re bringing some power into Shen’s shield to let him scrap with meta peers more effectively, while giving him more breathing room in lane. We’re hoping this will stir up some diversity in the top lane and overall team compositions with the introduction of a second tank to the meta. We’re increasing the scorpion’s damage so he’s more equipped to slash through front line targets when itemizing as a bruiser (and a stinger, of course). As another flourish, we’re also making a quality-of-life change to his E. The general and his demon birds are performing fine in Average play, but they do worse the further up the ladder you climb. This is a pretty lengthy refresh, with a mix of buffs and nerfs, so we want to take the time to run through it. Let’s start with the spice and everything nice: Most notably, we’re significantly increasing his W range (more than double when maxed!). We think this change will be particularly transformative for Skilled Swain players who will be able to impact other lanes from a distance all game long. In addition, we’re also bumping down the cooldown on his Q to help him fulfill his battle-mage fantasy with more casts. As for the nerfs: to balance out the buffs, we’re pulling back on his movement speed. We’ve also removed his mana restore to skew power away from Swains in low Elo who can profit off of fewer skills dodged, when the reverse happens in higher Elos. Overall, we’re hoping these buffs will empower Skilled players in both mid and support, with sweeping changes across the board to give him the tools he needs to feel like a more functional mid laner. We’re hooking some power out of Thresh’s lantern, since pros tend to max this spell earlier than the average player. Twisted Fate has been able to consistently reach an intimidating state where he can balance both split-pushing and global pressure in Pro and Elite play. As a result, we’re reducing his lane pressure and wave control in earlier phases of the game so that he’ll have to gamble more when picking a card (and a lane!). Yuumi was mush, mushed! by her E mana cost nerf in 10.13, so we’re here to follow up (and give her all the chin scratches in the process). As we mentioned in this article, we’re making her passive more important to her success in a way where she’ll need to take more risks if she wants to provide more sustain. Similar to the previous VFX updates we've made in the past (Ziggs, Thresh, Lux, etc.), we're working on updates to some champion ability VFX. Our aim is to get their VFX up to current League standards and improve gameplay clarity. In this patch, we'll be releasing a VFX update for Ahri and Udyr! As a reminder, VFX updates don’t impact who gets a VGU, where we take model, gameplay, and thematic into account too. They are simply dev passion projects. Spellthief's line of items is being overshadowed by the Relic Shield line for AP users, especially enchanters. While it's fine if they're competitive options, the more defensive option should not always be the dominant choice. Unsealed Spellbook has become a dominant choice at the highest tiers of play (Pro and Elite) and often encourages minimal interactions early game. We’re reducing its power a bit so it doesn't outshine other options. Nexus Blitz returns with the Spirit Blossom event, now permanently set in the Temple of Lily and Lotus, a long-forgotten temple of the Canghapi vastaya! We’ve got a whole slew of events, from old favorites to brand new ones, along with new rewards, bug fixes, and quality-of-life changes. For more details, read this article!"
10.16,2020-08-04,"Okay, this is a long one. We've got a big list of small tweaks to bring more razzle dazzle as we gear up for Worlds! We think the meta’s at a good place, so we’re carefully mixing things up without throwing caution to the wind (although Yasuo’s down there somewhere…). This means we’re bringing up the zhuzh, from marksfolks (Miss Fortune, Lucian, Tristana) to junglefolks (Evelynn, Hecarim, Skarner). Which also means we’re un-zhuzhing those who have been omnipresent picks (Karma, Syndra, Volibear) to open up their counterpicks and to give their enemies more chances to retaliate. We’re also tidying up some champions by giving them more cohesive identities and sharpening their strengths, while giving others more clarity in their kits. Finally, on a housekeeping note, the dev team is taking some AFK time in the near future. For League, this means 10.16 will last twice as long as a normal patch and we'll be skipping patch 10.17. We're planning to ship a set of balance changes around the time 10.17 would have launched, though, so keep an eye out for those details. The next full patch will be 10.18! So zoom your way down—and once you’re well-read, you’ll be well-ready to take on the third ranked split of the season, the world, etc, etc. Take this portal if you're looking for TFT's patch notes! On August 9th at 11:59 PM local time, the third and final ranked split of the season will begin, but with a little something extra this time! In addition to the usual split rewards, we'll also be granting a random series 1 Eternal capsule to anyone earning 750 Split points. Yone wields his swords in 10.16! High-res versions of Yone's splashes are available on League Displays! Now that Akali’s been in the shadows of Pro, we can help her hit the (assassin's) mark for all levels of play by bringing up her early game damage. We’re also streamlining the damage type in her kit so that she’s able to itemize more effectively and deal more to enemies who aren’t building defensively. We’re pulling back on a scaling Ashe buff we gave her in 10.8 to make more space for other marksmen with less early game power and utility to shine late game against her. Bard has been chiming in quite a bit, especially in Pro play, so we’re toning down his power in early game to open up more avenues for counter picks and in-lane pressure. Spiking some power into Eve’s Q so that she can bring her charm into the jungle and in early skirmishes. We’ve also found that her Q cooldown refund from monsters has been a source of confusion and annoyance for players, so we’re taking that out for more gameplay clarity. As we near the big games, we’ve identified a lack of scaling skirmishers who can keep pressure in a side lane. Because of this, we want to keep Fiora in tip-top form, and to be able to offer teams more strategy. We’re helping her strike quickly, strike deftly! in early fights, along with increasing her mobility for split pushing. To balance it out, we’re also lightly tapping down her cooldown refund. The Horseman’s been at a trot, so we’re ponying up by boosting his potential for ganks and engage. Note that this added movement speed procs his passive for that sweet, sweet bonus damage. Now, it’s Jax’s turn! Similar to Fiora, we’re hoping to bring the Grandmaster back onto the scene by making him a more viable counterpick... with more counterstrikes. With his E more readily available, he’ll be able to see fights through in a different manner. Jhin hasn’t been able to call the shots, especially around towers. We’re loosening his passive crit damage restriction from all the way back in 6.4 so that he can take down structures more effectively and keep up with peers with expanded abilities for damaging towers. Fixed a bug in Jinx’s R where the damage cap against monsters was capped against champions instead, majorly impacting her power against enemies with high health. We’re bringing the super, the mega, and the death by uncapping the damage against all targets! Karma has continued to be a strong multi-role flex champion who tends to have too much control and safety, so we’re trimming down her solo lane agency by pulling back on a spell that she relies on for waveclear. Now that we’re seeing an increase in Karthus players and higher win rates, we’re walking back one of the bigger buffs from 10.14 that’s lent him more strength than anticipated. The bug consumed, and the bug adapted. Over the course of the past few patches and our last buff, Kha’Zix has crept above the pack for our skilled players, so we're pulling slightly back on the same lever in 10.14 to find a happy middle ground. Lucian has been out of meta for a while, losing consistently to his more meta peers with longer ranges, even in beginning phases of the game. We’re putting him back on the path of vengeance by increasing his power. Pirate lady’s been in a misfortunate place, and she’s no fool. We’re giving her a small love tap to make sure she’s relevant as an early game marksman. Bot lane has been awash with dive-heavy supports with strong CC, so we’re helping Morgana unshackle her potential as a promising counterpick. Naut has been anchored as a persistent menace in Pro bot lanes, so we’re lowering his resilience to harass and the reliability of his early game all-ins. Giving Neeko some love in her trading and waveclear against other prominent mids. We think this will help her come into her own, you know, for her to really be herself and no one else. Nocturne is chopping down mid laners at an alarming rate in Average play. Trimming his pushing and sustain power, while letting him be at a similar power level in the jungle. Rakan may have the moves, but he still needs to get a move on. We’re amping up the tempo so that he can beat down enemies as one of the premier engage support champions. Reeling back Sett players who rely on his base values with very tanky builds to plow their way through games. Even with our last round of buffs in 10.15, Skarner still feels like he’s in hibernation with his kin. We’re doing another pass to put a bit more sting in his...stinger? We’re continuing to sharpen Syndra’s power as she remains as a dominant pick in Pro play. This time, we’re honing in on her oppressive command in lane, especially from early to mid game. Tristana has been fairly irrelevant since the nerfs to her early game attack range—except for in mid lane, where she’s still able to bully out certain champs. We’re gunning for her to be a viable marksman by buffing her bot lane crit build. Boosting up this tiny yordle to better master the mid lane. To do this, we’re giving him more MR, since he’s already quite powerful in bot lane. Volibear is a rare beast that is relentlessly bringing the storm for our Average and Pro players. Reducing his mobility and scaling into late game. Carefully buffing Yasuo to target mid lane and Pro play. Like Veigar, we’re giving him more breathing room in mid, where there’s the most magic damage dealers. We’re also boosting his ult output for coordinated teams to play off of. Bumping up this bombing bud to better bonk down buildings and, more importantly, to bring an artillery mage into the meta. Nimbus Cloak has become the go-to for both jungle and AD as a consistent offensive and defensive tool. We’re lowering some of its overall strength, specifically in consideration of Smite and Hexflash, so that it’s not as ubiquitous of a choice. Ionia Clash has now begun its recruitment session! Check out the Clash tab in client for specific start times and details! We're kicking off an opt-in beta test of DX11 support for League! Head to our full post for details on how to join."
10.18,2020-09-01,"Hey, do you remember? Dancin' in September? Come on, let’s chase the clouds away with 10.18! Classic tunes aside, we’ve got a whole slew of changes for you in this patch. Big ticket items include flexing fancy feet to a foxy favorite and bringing some action to the Bringer of Justice. The rest are mostly changes in light of how champions are faring, especially in Skilled and Pro MMR: shimmying down some faces who have overstayed their welcome (Galio, Ashe, Sett), and bopping up some friends who need some spring in their step (Miss Fortune, Rumble, Twitch). Past champions, we’ve been seeing Guardian dominate on pretty much every support, so we’ve taken some steps to reel it back a bit and open up options for other Keystones. And another one for you, or really, one for everyone—One For All returns this patch! Along with a whole array of Client, FX, and general fixes. You know the drill. So tango your way down and jig your way over to the Rift. We’ll be dancing with ya. Take this portal if you're looking for TFT's patch notes! One For All returns with PsyOps on September 3rd, 2020 at 1:00PM PT. Join a team of doppelgangers as you and your teammates show off your different playstyles as the same champ (or the same playstyle, whatever!). Ahri's identity and gameplay have become a little muddled over time, and she isn’t as charming as we’d like her to be. We’re making some kit changes, especially to her W, to reinforce an identity of a flighty mage who can weave in and out of fights as she looks for the perfect moment to strike. In addition, we’re also shifting her Essence thievery from her Q to her passive to open up more opportunities for her to reap its healing rewards when trading with enemy champions. Altogether, she should feel equipped to (spirit) rush into more combos and outplays. Ashe has remained one of the primary marksmen in Pro play, so we’re icing some of her power. Galio’s Q lets him clear waves early without much risk, so we’re bringing down his damage so that he has to invest a bit more before flying across the map. A little nudge to J4's early strength to help compete with the current jungle meta. Improving some clarity around Kayle’s mana management: by removing the mana cost on her E, we’re giving her an overall net drop on mana dependence. In combination with a boosted missile speed on her blade, we’re hoping to see her ascend to more exciting laning, where she can more readily spar with her enemy laner. This caustic caterpillar-creature is almost always toeing (and oozing around) the line, and he’s finally crossed it. In response, we’re lowering his defenses to highlight his identity as a glass cannon marksman: severely spitty, but slightly squishy. Making another opportunistic buff on an early game focused markspirate, so we’re reverting some nerfs from earlier this season (10.10 and 10.3, if you’re curious)! We’re heating things up by giving Rumble a jump start that’ll hopefully park him as another good early game Pro pick option. Sett’s continued to muscle his way through Pro levels of play, especially with low-economy tank and utility builds. Since our previous nerf to his base values wasn't sufficient, we're taking a larger swing at him. To do this, we’re adjusting how he scales with damage and gold to incentivize players to swap to damage-oriented builds instead. Expect another check in after Worlds to make sure he’s… well, all set. The buff to Shen in 10.15 made him a bit stronger than expected, so we’re pulling back slightly. In fixing a minor Shyvana clarity bug, we uncovered other levers to polish up. The result is a major clarity fix and thus a minor balance change. Previously, dragon Shyvana's radius on her E scaled with her Flame Breath rank-ups, but this effect was not accurately represented in her visuals or the tooltip. We’ve decided to remove it, as the reliability of an important spell should not change dramatically throughout the game. Overall, we expect these changes to be a small nerf to AP Shyvana, a small buff to AD Shyvana, and a large increase to Flame Breath's clarity. It seems we’ve left this rat in the sewers, and we know his paws are itching to get back into the meta. We’re bringing up the power in his ult and tossing in some spice into his E. Now, here’s a spell you can feel! Xin Zhao is no longer the early game threat he used to be, so we’re giving him a bump up in his damage and clear. Guardian is overperforming on mage, enchanters, and tank supports relative to other Keystones. We’re toning down its power to open up other options. We got a longer list of League Client bugfixes and QoL changes this patch, so we're putting them in a specific section! Be sure to check out the latest in our Client Cleanup series and stay tuned for a new post later this week. We got some more VFX updates for you in this patch! Bring in the lucky contestants: Malzahar, Nocturne, Viktor, and Ignite (yeah, we know this is not technically a champion). Once again, our goals for these sorts of smaller scope updates is to improve the overall gameplay clarity of VFX whilst bringing them up to modern League of Legends standards. This means that our efforts are primarily aimed at abilities which do not clearly communicate their hitbox."
10.19,2020-09-15,"Hi! The Worlds patch is here, a new markswoman is here, you’re here...it’s a dang party! The world itself has been a little topsy-turvy, but there’s nothing crazy here, we promise. This patch is focused on tidying things up for the championship, which means levelling the playing field so that not one figure is dwarfing the rest (here’s looking at you, Caitlyn). This also means we’re giving a bit of a kick to some friends to, well, kick them into gear and into the competitive spotlight. These buffs are mostly geared towards marksmen, junglers, and mid laners, in the hopes of mixing things up a tad for our biggest tournament of the year! And finally, a warm welcome to Samira, who can slice and dice (and blast) it up in the bot lane. I mean, she’s got an eye patch and everything. And away we go! Take this portal if you're looking for TFT's patch notes! The Eternals Series 1 and Starter Series Passes are going on sale for all champions! Take this chance to capture, celebrate, and flex your moments of glory with your main or your second main… or your third! The discount on the Series 1 and Starter Series Passes begins on September 24, 2020 and ends October 8, 2020. Samira shows-off her moves in 10.19 on September 21. High-res versions of Samira's splashes are available on League Displays! The changes to Ahri in patch 10.18 were a little too cautious in terms of power. Giving her some strength back by firing up her W to make it feel more satisfying. We’ve been seeing an increase in Akali’s presence in Pro since our buffs in 10.16. We’re reverting our past changes (10.16 and 10.12) on her to make sure this deadly assassin doesn’t completely dominate the meta at Worlds. Our moonlight man was nudged out of the Pro meta through consistent nerfs. It’s time to restore some faith to his weapons. Azir has (a)risen to the upper tier of mages in Pro play, and has become the de facto option for scaling compositions. Since pro players are able to get more 3-soldier autos off than in lower MMR (thus proccing doubled bonus attack speed), we’re bringing down the ratio. Caitlyn has been dominating and we're not confident that even with our previous nerfs there'd be a level playing field. It feels bad to put extra cuffs on the sheriff, but it seems it's prudent in order to open up bottom lane diversity for our most important tournament. Irelia carries her blades with grace, but could also carry more power. We’re strengthening her ultimate to help her slice and dice things up as the game progresses. Ivern has seen little play in Pro games despite holding his own in other skill brackets. This change encourages Ivern to work with his friends to catch up to their enemies. Similar to Akali, Lucian is trending towards becoming an overbearing flex pick at Worlds. Since a large reason for this is due to his solo lane prowess, we’re reining that in by lowering his experience scaling. Senna has been stepping into the limelight, both as a bot lane carry and as a utility-first marksman in the Pro meta. We’re reducing her scaling via Mist Wraiths to grant more leeway to other traditional hypercarries. Sivir’s fallen off the radar, so we’re increasing her ability to hunt down enemies in the hopes that she boomerangs back into power. Sylas has been shackled in Pro play due to having a weaker laning phase and stronger counterpicks. This will allow us now to amplify his real niche of snatching an ultimate here and an ultimate there, which means...he's getting Hijacked up. Twisted Fate remains a meta-driving force in Pro play as a safe roamer, so we’re paring down some of that. Tiger Stance tends to be the go-to for Udyr players, so we’re giving a bit more bite (and burn) to his Phoenix Stance and its AoE damage playstyle. Vayne has been in the shadows as of late and hasn’t been succeeding in places she traditionally has, so we’re heightening Vayne's window of power by letting her excel in the moments you pick her for."
10.20,2020-09-29,"Hi friends. It’s just about that time to wake up, ‘cause September’s coming to an end. This patch is on the lighter side, with most changes concentrated on tuning champion scaling as games progress. Big ticket items include a helping hand to a certain blue mage by giving him more damage to play with, along with tempering down Karthus who’s been a nightmare in the bot lane. Apart from champion changes, Worlds 2020 Clash is on its way to you! It's time to be the hero and to kiss away the pain. And to win a cool trophy.On a clerical note, upon logging in this patch, you’ll be presented with the new Code of Conduct. This agreement helps us define the behaviors we expect of you as a player. So get on the rift and that future boom boom boom. You gotta get that. Take this portal if you're looking for TFT's patch notes! Aatrox wants to step into his full potential as the unkillable DPS monster, so we’re helping him harness his darkin power by curbing some of his mid- to late-game falloff. Hopefully now this warrior demon won’t fall flat in late game teamfights. We’re giving Braum a little more agency in solo queue with some extra damage and lower mana costs. Illaoi has been flailing around top lane, so we’re giving her tentacles more oomph, especially post laning phase. We’re also smoothing out her passive scaling so that she gets some benefit every level instead of every two. We're continuing to tweak Karthus to get him into a comfortable place since he’s been a bit overwhelming across the map, especially in bot lane. Aiming to bring down his defenses against ADCs. Kassadin players in Skilled/Elite are too often able to stonewall lanes and scale with their early defensive tools. Many have started maxing E first, so we're pushing Kassadin to have to invest more for a safer laning phase. Katarina has risen in the ranks in Skilled and Elite games as a swift assassin who can secure snowball advantages with early roams, so we’re targeting her AD ratios to lower some of her early threat. Kled has been a strong force in both mid and top lane at all levels of play, so we want to open up more avenues to knock this yordle off his high horse lizard. Lulu has seen wild growth in the bot lane by helping carries out a pinch too much. Since she’s both a strong offensive and defensive support, we're toning down her combative scaling on Whimsy in the late game. We’re cutting down some of Maokai’s brawling power to give his top lane peers some space to come out of the woods. Nunu's skirmishing power is a little too strong when coupled with his top-tier gank presence and objective control. Weakening some of that strength so he rolls over junglers a little less. Since he’s recently escaped from his Worlds rune prison, we're ready to overload Ryze in preparation for the offseason. Sion could use a little help in the jungle, so we’re charging up his Q. A fun bonus: now he can slay baby Raptors more efficiently with his Q+W combo. The jungle could juggle a few more juggernauts, and Urgot has what it takes to be a viable pick. We’re beefing up this beefy man’s damage against monsters. After a long time spreading corruption at the highest tiers of play, Varus has fallen and once again has room for buffs. Relentless Hunter is massively outperforming other runes, especially in Skilled mid lanes. We’re bringing down its reliability and reducing some of its base power. Worlds 2020 Clash is coming! Battle through a 16-team bracket to earn even more glorious prizes and a Summoner's Cup-inspired trophy. Check out the Clash tab in client for specific start times and details!"
10.21,2020-10-13,"There’s spook in the air, pumpkin in everything, and Worlds pick’ems in our hopes. Happy October and welcome to 10.21! This is another light patch to keep gears running smoothly through the championship and the end of the ranked season. Our focus here is to maintain stability and balance, so nothing too wild. For buffs, we’re boosting up a spiritual soul and a celestial weapon; for nerfs, we honed in on Elite play across the board, curbing the power of some junglers (Hecarim, Graves, Nidalee) and toning down Samira, who’s been an unstoppable force. Also, another round of Worlds Clash is ready to go, so remember to reap some spicy plays and rewards. And that’s all, folks! See ya next time. Take this portal if you're looking for TFT's patch notes! We aren’t seeing Aphelios on the Worlds stage, so it’s time for us to take a moonshot at propping him back up for all other levels of play. We’re giving him extra oomph on the ranking of his Lethality and sharpening the strengths of his various ultimates. Camille is one of the strongest and most prevalent top laners in Elite play, so we're pulling some power out of her split-pushing and sustained-dueling potential. Corki's early game makes it hard for him to stand up to other mid laners. Giving him a small boost to help him take off a little faster. Graves' combination of clear speed and durability have made him a prominent Elite jungle pick. Reducing some of his innate tankiness so that Graves is more punishable when he missteps. Bringing down some burst from this speeding stallion. A new mantra for Karma: to channel her Mantra more often. We’re increasing the payoff for dishing out damage so Karma can optimize access to her Mantra. The monk could use more reliable damage to see games through. Bringing down the jungle cat’s early clear and dueling. This should be especially impactful in Elite play, where autos and attack range are utilized more effectively. Support Pantheon has spiked in popularity as a shield-swinging strongman who provides solid CC and durability. To balance his resilience, we’re moving some power from his base damage to his AD ratios over time. This should weaken the early kill threat from low-income supports while padding the blow for solo-lane Pantheons who have quicker access to items. Samira is at a place where her early game safety and mobility is a touch too reliable, so we’re bumping up her cooldown in a way so that she has to play more conservatively in the first stages of the game. We’re also trimming some of her damage so that her all ins are a little less potent. Smoothing out this pillar-punching prince’s passive so he doesn’t hit arbitrary power spikes at various levels, and throwing in a small buff at every level to help him bash down enemies. In combination with an increase in his steroid uptime, we’re hoping this will tip the scales in favor for macho Trundles to really win fights. Bird Udyr is still performing worse than Cat Udyr, so we’re firing up Phoenix Stance’s AoE damage to sharpen the difference in style between the two stances (Phoenix’s waveclear vs. Tiger’s dueling potential), and encourage more folks to birdy up. Nimbus Cloak’s popularity has begun to stifle rune choices, especially in the jungle. We’re weakening its power overall, with a specific target on its synergy with Smite. The second round of Worlds Clash is live, with a 16-team bracket and special rewards! Fight for the cup in the biggest Clash yet."
10.22,2020-10-27,"Here we go— one last light patch for the books before we switch gears into heavy-duty preseason changes! Kick back, put on some tunes (we’ve got a new pop star in our midst, after all), you know the drill. First off, we attacked the Fire Nation and changed some things (not everything!) with our favorite fire friends (Annie and Brand). These tweaks should help their skills feel more intuitive, find more flexibility in their roles, and kick their strength up a notch. We also made a couple more clarity checks (Amumu, Jinx, Galio), and wrapped it all up with the usual balance changes: firing up recent outcasts like Sejuani and LeBlanc, and nudging prominent champs like Samira and Karthus off their steamrollers. One last clerical note: we’ve completed our test changes regarding matchmaking. Now, all players in ranked queues will more often experience being grouped up with similarly ranked people. This should result in matches that appear closer by rank. And that’s it! We hope the rest of your October is more treat than trick. See ya in the next one. Take this portal if you're looking for TFT's patch notes! Runeterra's premier idol takes the stage in 10.22! High-res versions of Seraphine's splashes are available on League Displays! Improving clarity on Amumu’s ult, which should also lead to a minor bump up in his mojo. We’re giving Annie more ways to use her shield while keeping it a simple and intuitive defense when Annie just wants to play on her own. Adding more satisfaction and experiential variety to her main skill to get more bang for your buck rank ups. Once upon a time, Brand was a mid laner—but in recent history, he’s found a comfortable home as a support. To give him some steam, we’re firing up his offense to promote a more aggressive playstyle. In addition, we tapped down the percentage damage that support Brands typically rely on in order to even out his overall power. Altogether, this should help Brand feel equipped to blaze back into mid without overstepping his current strength as a support. A consistency change to ensure players don’t accidentally zero-cast their dash, while also giving Galio’s enemies more opportunities to dodge it. This clarity tweak on Jinx’s Chompers should provide more visible and appreciable damage. Karthus is too reliable of a jungle, mid, and bot pick because he can permashove waves and permaclear camps with little to no cost. We’re lowering his ability to deal sustained damage and gain massive leads so that his opponents have a chance to fight back. Smoke and mirrors aside, LeBlanc has been in a weak spot across all levels of play. We’re giving her another trick up her sleeve by jazzing up one of her more underwhelming and underappreciated abilities. This should encourage players to rely more on her E, which is often left at rank one until late in the game. Top Lulu has been doing too well in Skilled play, and all that glitters is not gold. We’re reducing her scaling damage to mitigate her ability to consistently harass opponents and waveclear. One more clarity check, this time to make Nasus’ ultimate feel more intuitive. We also don’t think he’d be able to resist the overall buff. Samira has quickly made her mark as a powerhouse ADC who can effortlessly slash, bash, and dash into a snowbally lead. We’re pulling out some of her early brawling power to reduce her reliability. The jungle meta has turned a cold shoulder to Sejuani. It's finally time to give our favorite boar some love and release Sejuani and Bristle from their cages glacial prison. The current marksman ecosystem hasn’t been well-suited for this marksbird. We’re buffing up her ability to let her feathers fly. Bringing down some of Zed’s reliable damage so that he has to lean more on other parts of his kit to get ya. We’ve added range indicators for champion clones and pets that snap back when exceeding their range. The indicator is centered around the clone/pet and will only appear when the unit is within 500 range of the teleport leash. Clash teams can now have up to 20 invites out at a time. Once your team fills up, all open invites will be cancelled. In addition, the Shadow Isles Cup schedule is now live in the client! Note that it's taking place after the season ends next month, so the VP you earn won't count for End of Season 2020 Rewards. We'll let you know when tournament VP will begin counting for End of Season 2021 Rewards."
10.23,2020-11-10,"It's that time again! It's preseason, baby, and this year, we're moving and shaking with huge item changes from the Item Shop you open up every game to updates for some of your favorites to an all-new tier of majestic Mythic items. As usual, we'll be closely monitoring all the balance metrics we've outlined earlier this year and see how these changes affect the overall meta for veterans. Additionally, a huge goal of ours with this Item rework was to help the system feel a lot more intuitive for all players (both old and new), so let us know your thoughts! Take this portal if you're looking for TFT's patch notes! First, some ARAM balance changes. Now bugfixes. And finally, Immolate balance changes to target tanks. Balance changes first! For mid-patch updates (especially so close to launch), we're focusing on clear outliers-not everything that got stronger or weaker. More changes will come in the weeks ahead as stable data becomes available! We've also got a bunch of bugfixes. The Item Shop refresh was designed with a few different goals. We wanted to create a streamlined, data-based Recommended Items experience, Improve the usability of the All Items view, maintain the ability to use and import item sets, and update the visual look and feel to match League’s evolving aesthetic. As always, we'll be keeping our ears to the ground and will continue working with you all to make the item shop the best it can be. The Recommended Items page displays relevant items for your champion based on where you currently are in your build, who you're up against, and how the game is progressing. It's meant to provide a quick way for you to understand what comes next on your journey to go plus ultra. The All Items page is where you go if you want to see all the items. It contains everything you need to slice and dice the armory of League down to reasonable chunks. You may have noticed some tabs hanging out on the left side of the shop. Introducing the Quickbuy panels! They make commonly purchased items like potions, elixirs, wards, and boots easy to access and quick… to… buy. Mythic items are the new, highest item tier that will become the cornerstone of your build, with big effects that define your playstyle in each game. You can only own one at a time, so selecting a Mythic item (and the effects it grants) depends on your opponents and the game state. Your Mythic also sets the tone for the rest of your build, both in terms of which other items you'll want to pick up as well as a Mythic Passive that adds extra stats to your other fully completed items (now known as Legendary items). Mythic items generally carry the most complex effects and strongly impact your playstyle. Even with the addition of a new tier of items, our goal isn't to inflate the power level of items overall. Mythics make your first choice more powerful than in the past, but we're borrowing that strength from the other item tiers to keep build strength relatively similar on the whole. Galeforce gives marksman champions a way to dodge high-impact skillshots or aggressively finish off low-health targets. Kraken Slayer allows a free-firing marksman to cut even the beefiest enemies down to size. Immortal Shieldbow helps marksman champions survive burst damage and fight their way back from the brink. Sunfire Aegis turns tanks into dangerous threats for enemies who take extended fights. Frostfire Gauntlet can turn any tank into an inescapable behemoth. For the tanks who love starting fights, Turbo Chemtank allows them to lead the charge into battle. With Duskblade, assassins can keep their enemies guessing while wrecking invisible havoc in teamfights. Eclipse helps assassins weave in and out of fights and take down tankier opponents in drawn-out encounters. Prowler's Claw lets assassins get up close and personal with their prey, amplifying their damage for one fatal combo. Liandry's Anguish allows mages to burn through health and resistances and excel in longer fights. Luden's Tempest offers mages upfront burst power and the speed to reposition for another round. With Everfrost, mages can control the battlefield and lock down their opponents in ice. This is especially useful for disengaging. Rocketbelt gives shorter-range mages a way to blast onto the scene to get in range to destroy enemy champions. Mages and tankier magic damage dealers can dominate fights that go long with ramping damage and healing. Night Harvester is a great tool for magic-damage-dealing assassins and bruisers who want to work their way through the entire enemy team, rather than taking out one target and then bouncing out of the fight. Allows fighters to take over long fights with ramping attack damage and repeated bursts of Spellblade procs. Fighters can come back from the brink of death with a well-timed Thirsting Slash heal and increased attack damage while injured. There's no escaping a fighter wielding Stridebreaker. Your health? My health! This item allows fighters to steal chunks of their opponents' health with Spellblade and chew through tankier targets. Shurelya's lets support players orchestrate flawless quintets by boosting allies' movement and damage at the start of fights. Help your team withstand the enemy offensive with teamwide protection. Dish out constant heals that ramp up over the fight. Use your CC to call the shots as you mark enemies to be cut down by your team. Why did the Mythic section above talk about ""ability haste"" rather than ""cooldown reduction,"" and why didn't we explain ability haste first? Because Mythics are cooler, so we put them first for people with short attention spans. Cooldown reduction was more valuable the more of it you got. Every percent reduced your cooldown by the same amount-say, one second off a 100-second cooldown. That one second didn't change even as the cooldown shrank. For that same 100-second cooldown, your 31st point of CDR took one second off the remaining 70-second cooldown, which is more than 1%. As such, CDR had to be capped at 40% to avoid going out of control, locking you out of a lot of items once you reached that cap. Every point of ability haste lets you cast 1% faster. On paper, that makes it look like it gets less valuable the more you have because your cooldown shrinks by less and less each time. It's actually the same amount of power. 50 ability haste lets you cast an extra half a spell during the original cooldown. The next 50 gets you to a full extra cast (100% faster). If you get another 100 ability haste, you get another whole cast (200% faster). This linear scaling allows us to remove the cap, so you can buy as much as you want. The big change here is that life steal now counts physical damage dealt by on-hit effects-since the idea is ""heal from your attacks,"" it's more understandable if we include the whole attack. The other note is the addition of ""physical vamp,"" (which currently exists just on Sanguine Blade) so its sustain can apply to assassins' abilities too. If you're curious whether that means we'll eventually bring back spell vamp, the answer is ""maybe!"" Reducing the value of each point of critical strike chance and offering less of it per item allows us to smooth out marksman's build scaling and put more interesting-and powerful-unique effects on their items. They'll be stronger early- and mid-game, and their late-game damage will be less unilaterally based on constant crits since the other parts of their items will be more influential. Also, by spreading crit across five items (read: every non-boots slot) in marksman builds, we can put crit chance on more items because marksmen no longer run the risk of overcapping and losing access to items they otherwise would've wanted. ""Legendary"" is the category of item that used to be the most powerful tier. They're your completed non-boots items that don't build into anything else. We assessed different item classes to see which niches were most needed to create more meaningful choices. We also ensured that tools that were taken out of the item pool had good replacements when it made sense. Since Liandry's is now a Mythic, for instance, Demonic Embrace fills the niche for tankier champs who can't pick Liandry's every game, but still need a burn effect to deal relevant damage in fights. Because Mercurial Scimitar is now geared more towards marksman champions, we created a new version for fighters and assassins. Grievous Wounds warrants a special callout: We want to give more people access to it in ways that feel appropriate for their playstyles. The Collector offers marksman champions a more aggressive option for when they find themselves facing squishy foes. Navori Quickblades allows crit-heavy builds to scale their ability-casting as well. Force of Nature helps turn tanks into swift behemoths in the face of ability-cast-heavy enemy teams. Serpent's Fang helps assassins strike back against shield-heavy compositions that formerly rendered them weak. Gives long-range artillery and control mages another damage alternative that loops into their playstyle. If you want to deal death by a thousand spells instead of one needlessly large burst (and move fast while doing it), this is for you. A new helm for those bruisers and battlemages that want to get into the thick of things, bulk up, and deal excellent damage over time. Seryla's Grudge caps off assassin builds, slowing enemies into their graves. With the rest of their items providing lethality to deal with carries early and mid game, Grudge's percent penetration gives its users the means to threaten tanks in the late game as well. The CC-cleansing option for fighters, as an alternative for Mercurial which caters to crit users. Grievous Wounds option for fighters and assassins that will help you finish off pesky healer comps when they're at low health. A Grievous Wounds option for support champions which is amplified by immobilizing enemy champions. New item for enchanters that lets you support mage carries and zoom around alongside them. Ever needed one more pocket? We're taking a swing at solving the age-old inventory crunch for support players by giving them access to a growing item that can hold Control Wards. Keep your final slot for some combat power while establishing your dominance as the vision controller. Scale later into the game by turning your ward slot into a power slot. The six item fantasy is now a reality for supports. Just like with to our goals for new Legendaries, we wanted to ensure existing options all offer a clear, unique reason to buy them, and that the item shop as a whole gives champions the tools they need to bring their innate strengths to bear, play into their allies, and react to enemy threats. One trend you'll notice is that many active effects have been removed or changed into passives: We want Mythics to house the most exciting and complex item effects, which meant simplifying Legendaries to ensure builds overall weren't becoming more complicated. Note: For each item below that has its own section, functionality has changed enough that the usual ""before -> after"" treatment felt like the wrong approach. We want to equip you with the ability to evaluate ""When do I want to buy this item now?"" and provide a clean, comprehensive rundown of what each item offers does that better. There's a bucket at the bottom for items that are only getting small tuning adjustments—those'll have the ""before -> after"" lists since they still work the same. Previously, Mortal Reminder's percent penetration usually meant that completing it early was worse than buying more damage, since enemies needed to stack Armor before the penetration really mattered. Now, Mortal Reminder's more favorable build path and upgraded Grievous Wounds on completion offer additional incentive to complete it at all stages of the game. On-hit builds didn't have many build options since so much of the attack-focused portion of the shop is focused on the crit system. Rather than continue to have on-hit and crit continue fighting for item niches, Guinsoo's Rageblade now acts as a bridge between the crit and on-hit ecosystems, allowing Kog'Maws to access effects like Phantom Dancer or Runaan's Hurricane without wasting stats. Phantom Dancer's defensive niche has been claimed by Immortal Shieldbow, so we're returning Phantom Dancer to its previous purpose as the highest attack and movement speed of the Zeal items. Its new passive emphasizes that Phantom Dancer is a top-tier choice when you can stand and fire in extended fights. Lord Dominik's Regards (and OG Last Whisper from years ago) has always occupied an anti-tank niche but has also flip-flopped between marksmen and assassins, always stronger for one class than the other. Situational items like this should feel rewarding to purchase when the occasion arises, meaning their stats need to be appropriately powerful for the class they're meant for. So, Lord Dominik's Regards has acquired some crit and is balanced for marksmen alone, while assassins have the new Serylda's Grudge item above. The ability-weaving pattern of Sheen has always been fun and popular on some marksman champions, but Trinity Force frequently fell below the viability bar for those champions since it was balanced for fighters. Enter Essence Reaver, which has been revamped to double-down on the fantasy of a spell-slinging basic attacker. Infinity Edge is an iconic and valuable part of the marksman ecosystem, but buying it first most every game left little room for anything else to compete. We've reenvisioned Infinity Edge in a Deathcap-esque form that increases in value as a crit build progresses, allowing it to remain a staple power-spike in crit builds without defining the marksman early game with its awkward build path and lack of utility. Manamune should be a valuable purchase to AD spellcasters who enjoy mana as well as AD. Ability haste in addition to the Muramana changes should broaden the list of champions who can use this item. Following the Manamune changes, allowing Muramana to proc on abilities further encourages AD casters to consider a new addition to their item builds. Removing the mana consumption increases clarity and lets users focus more on letting their spells fly. The previous version of Seraph's offered a power scaling option both offensively and defensively with its shield. We're shifting the Archangel's line to be the purely offensive, greedy option by focusing on its slacking mana and AP fantasy. Seraph's now gives purely offensive stats as a scaling item for mages. Instead of an on-demand shield (which allowed Seraph's to provide both offensive and defensive options), Seraph's now gives more scaling AP and mana. Opening up Lich Bane to not just mana users by removing the mana from Sheen and also giving it higher upfront damage at the cost of a slightly increased cooldown. Wanted to retain this iconic and unique active effect, but needed to make some room for the actives and other more complex effects coming through from Mythic items. Black Cleaver did many things decently well, but we want it to do fewer things better. Moved its movement-speed-granting effects to more movement based items and replaced with an execution effect on targets you've fully shredded. Active re-homed in “Goredrinker,” a fighter Mythic with room for an effect of this complexity and power. Ravenous Hydra simplified to be THE vamp item for physical damage casters or basic attackers. Shaping Titanic Hydra to be a bridge between heavy tank builds and fighter builds. Some power taken out of its on-hit and moved to raw AD to give it a home with champions who don't attack as often but still like AD. With a few more healing options in the mythic space, we had to be judicious with other sources of healing. Replaced with movement speed to offer light fighters (Fiora, Yi, Ekko, etc) another powerful form of utility. Now with more AD to broaden appeal among fighters. With more specialized healing options elsewhere, we wanted Maw to stand out as THE anti-magic-burst item. Death's Dance was the 1-stop-shop for everything fighters needed. AoE healing, mitigation against all damage sources, bonus damage, cooldown, etc. We still offer all these effects in the item shop, but the combination requires piecing together a few more purchases. Death's Dance is sharpening its role into the anti-physical damage item. Sterak's is still your go-to optimal purchase for constant teamfighting. If you're dueling or in small skirmishes though, Death's Dance or Maw will outshine it against physical and magic damage, respectively. Retooling Randuin's to better identify its effectiveness as a powerful defensive tool against all physical damage and specifically crit-based attacks. While Randuin's fills the anti-crit space, Frozen Heart takes the same core effect but retains its previous niche as an anti-attack speed item. Reinforcing Gargoyle Stoneplate as the ideal item for players who love to teamfight and tank entire teams. Abyssal Mask now has a more streamlined use-case and has been broadened to increase all damage to the target, not just magic. On top of applying Grievous Wounds when hit, Thornmail now gives tanks a way to proactively apply the effect without waiting for enemies to attack. Zeke's previous effect was extremely powerful, but limited to small windows and was hard to appreciate. Updated the effect to be more easily accessible for beefier supports who want to lock-down and protect their carries. Moving Knight's Vow in the Warden niche by increasing the health and damage redirection on the item. A sharper movement speed effect should also help allies swoop in to save the day for their allies in peril. Making Morello a pure anti-healing item rather than a mixed-purpose confusing item so that you won't have to use your advanced math degree to determine optimal damage. We're promoting Sanguine Blade's life steal into the new physical vamp stat so ability-heavy assassins can benefit from its sustain as well while they clear waves and champions. Some items are only being returned to fit into preseason-the biggest change you'll find in any of the sections below is the addition or removal of stat types, but not entire unique effects (with Mikael's' regen-granting Harmony passive as an exception). As with the other Legendaries, keep in mind that Mythic passives add additional stats that aren't listed here, so things that look like flat nerfs are at least in part adjusting for that extra power. We want junglers to be able to engage with the item system instead of being forced to purchase the same dull item every game, especially with the Mythic item system making your first item so important. We're taking cues from last year's well-received update to support items and letting junglers progress toward their Smite without having to spend more money. That puts them on even footing with the other four positions in terms of being able to start on their Mythic right away. Also, we snuck some jungle camp changes into this section so junglers can process everything specific to the role in one place. ""You're welcome"" or ""we're sorry,"" depending on whether that helped or confused you personally. The blue one. The red one. We're also cleaning up Challenging Smite to make it a bit more intuitive. Overall, our aim is to slightly improve pathing diversity and make the camps feel distinct. We're running a consistency pass to remove some arcane optimizations and rules that aren't apparent in game. Gromp and Scuttle in particular are getting changes to emphasize their unique identities. In Scuttle's case, she'll also be a little less costly to lose since you're not losing a chunk of sustain. Epic items are the tier below Legendary: They're the mid-tier components of Legendary and Mythic items that build out of basic items. We're ensuring they serve their role as valuable building blocks, offering incremental stats and effects that smooth your progression toward bigger purchases. Like the Legendaries, we're providing blank-slate presentations of these Epics to give you a clean read on when you'll want to pick them up. New and updated have been mixed together since there aren't as many. Marksman champions suffer from awkward early-game components that leave them missing either attack damage or attack speed, both of which are critical for them to feel powerful. So, we created Noonquiver-an Epic that specifically builds into marksman Mythics and features both stats. Noonquiver also amplifies marksman PvE capabilities to provide the early lane management marksman champions crave without sending their PvP power over the top. Lastly, by giving it a smooth build path of smaller parts, it avoids the lane snowballing issue B.F. Sword had if you were forced to back before saving up 1300 gold. Giving on-hit champs the flexibility to access Guinsoo's new crit-converting effect without completing Rageblade itself so they can spec into crit chance items first if the situation calls for it. Percent armor penetration has Last Whisper as a component. Adding Blighting Jewel to establish build path parity for percent magic penetration. One of the new building-blocks of the system for mages who want to deal and heal. Giving mages earlier access to Grievous Wounds, like physical damage dealers get from Executioner's Calling. Orb is losing its flat penetration to get this effect. Simplifying and making the item cheaper. Opening up the item to be less restrictive on who can take and use it—the damage proc now applies to abilities too. The centerpoint of tank Mythics now scales better early, though it loses its bursty immobilize proc in exchange. We didn't have a movement speed + health component. Now we do. Giving an MR equivalent to Seeker's Armguard so when you need to survive a difficult ability power lane you have options. Changing the previous effect to something more selfish and noticeable by the owner. Changing Phage into a Health-scaling Epic that helps fighters beef up in longer fights. Its old passive is moving to a new item. Look down a few lines. Home to Phage's old passive, our new, more agility-themed weapon offers movement speed on hit and builds into several items that do the same. We're splitting up Tiamat's passive and active to let each take on more of a center-stage role as separate components. Tiamat is keeping the passive; the active is moving to a new item just below. Tiamat's active and passives were split up to let each of them take a more center stage in their respective item. Ironspike Whip inherited Tiamat's Active. Filling a hole in the system so that mana regen items with ability haste aren't 100% bound to heal and shield power. Like Legendaries, some Epics are getting simple tuning passes, based on how we want you to build into the new and updated Legendary and Mythic items. Finally, we've got our basic, starter, and support items. The ones that don't have any components of their own. Moving Tear into the Starting Item space to serve as a greedy, scaling option for spellcasters. The stacking mechanic has been changed to discourage empty spell spamming and encourage opportunistic trading. Making Seal a better option for those who don't need mana, and unbinding its strength from potions. Slightly broadening our starting item options so they're more favorable to those who use more spells and have mixed damage types. Opening up Doran's ring to non-mana users and bringing back the old last-hitting skill test. To ensure support builds are influenced similarly by their Mythic passives as other roles, we're counting the fully upgraded forms as Legendaries but reducing their innate stats so they don't become more powerful in the process. We're also buffing Spoils of War and Tribute so supports can bring their Mythics online closer to everyone else. A long, long time ago, Ninja Tabi granted dodge chance, allowing users to sometimes avoid basic attacks entirely. That stopped being the case in... *checks notes* 2012. We're finally catching up and re-theming these boots. Last on the list for our items world tour is paying respects to the items leaving the shop. Streamlining Conqueror's role as a damage-oriented rune by shifting its power from sustain to Adaptive Force. Toning back the overall sustain of Legend: Bloodline as its life steal was dominating the choice structure within the Precision tree and having a bigger impact on rune and item builds than a minor rune should, allowing champs to delay or altogether forego sustain purchases. Similar to Bloodline and Conqueror, lowering the overall amount of free sustain within the rune system to open up more choices within the rune and item systems. Presence of Mind's permanent stats were single-handedly solving resource issues. We're reworking the rune to be more in-line with other minor runes and tailored towards champions who prefer sustained combat. Updating Transcendence to still provide for spell-happy casters and anyone else in need of a little boost while fitting into the new uncapped haste system. Similar to Transcendence, Cosmic Insight has been updated to function in the new haste system. The rune is now more streamlined to focus on item haste and summoner spell haste to reduce some of the low-cost haste in the rune system. Updating Ingenious Hunter values to work with the haste system as well as broadening its use cases to all items with cooldowns so it should feel a little more usable than before. The CDR rune stat had to scale up over time to avoid letting champions reach the cap too quickly. Now that we're using ability haste, it gets to provide more immediate benefit. Small clarity update to Time Warp Tonic as the cooldown on consumables was occasionally confusing to players for a minor rune. The math behind this is super gross, but the gist is that Headshot's bonus damage scales off Infinity Edge's crit damage in a way that completely ignored preseason's systemic crit damage reduction. We're baking that systemic change into Headshot's calculations, though Cait is still arguably buffed relative to other marksmen since new IE's greater maximum crit damage increase washes out most of this nerf at full build. We still want Jhin's crits to feel noticeably different from his non-crits, so we're nerfing the AD he gets from crit chance instead of his crit damage. Bringing Senna into the crit system by having her crits happen less, but hit even stronger than before. Making sure Tryndamere doesn't waste stats at max Fury with his crit build. Now that the crit system offers more interesting options and comes in 20% increments, we wanted to make sure Yasuo wasn't wasting stats or getting locked out of exciting items because of his passive. Now that the crit system offers more interesting options and comes in 20% increments, we wanted to make sure Yone wasn't wasting stats or getting locked out of exciting items because of his passive. Adjusting Akali for the loss of Hextech Gunblade and Presence of Mind's increased Energy pool. With the loss of Gunblade and the lack of hybrid damage among Mythics, Katarina needed help to keep her identity as an assassin in the new item system. We're helping her adapt to the new shop by further differentiating AD and AP Katarina builds, adding new scaling hooks that let her access the on-hit system. The Katarina you know and love is still here, but without Gunblade dictating her build, her daggers might not look the same every time you see her. Reminder: Kat throws 15 daggers per ult. The landscape around Kayle is shifting dramatically and AP Kayle in particular may take a while to find replacements for previous favorites like Hextech Gunblade. We're lending AP builds some aid and ensuring that both forms of Kayle can hyperscale into late game. We're tying Ornn's Masterwork system into the Mythic system, opening up build diversity for both him and his allies by ensuring everyone can get an upgrade no matter their build. We're also giving Ornn some smithy power now that he only gets to upgrade one of his own items. Making Viktor embrace and engage with the new itemization system while also giving him a bit more oomph now that his Hex Core isn't there to amp him up. Between mana changes to items like Tear, Sheen, Lich Bane, and the lack of mana on most Mythic items, we're giving the following champions a +20 increase to mana growth: While our last changes helped bring Brand back into the midlane, he's a little too strong in Average play for both mid and support. Dampening down his early game damage to bring him back in line. Similar to Brand, we're focusing on knocking down some of the mummy's power in Average play by pulling back on some of his durability. Opening up Elise's build diversity with the new system. We're pushing the distinction between mid and support Seraphine. Mid Sera, who will be higher level throughout the game, will have better access to scaling damage via the Passive and Q changes and can now use E more comfortably for waveclear when needed. Support Sera won't be able to hit those same levels or damage numbers, but will still be able to lean on E-max to provide consistent CC for her team. Following up a prior buff that didn't actually put AP Twitch anywhere near the mark of playability. These changes are geared toward a playstyle of quickly stacking Deadly Venom and detonating it, then rat-tailing it out to reset. It'll scale worse than AD Twitch (who isn't sacrificing anything for these changes, by the way) and have less explosive openers with Spray and Pray than crit-based versions, but is hopefully an exciting alternative option for Twitch players. With AP fighter items coming into the game we're polishing this bear's AP playstyle to be a little more viable. His extended fights and farming should be bumped up enough with these changes for magebear to be a better opt-in option. We originally billed this as a quality of life change but have seen a bunch of questions, so let's talk about it now. For abilities and effects with delayed healing, it can be hard to know mid-fight how much health you (or your opponent) will get, leading to situations where you back out from a fight you could've won or stay in a fight you're about to lose. This change makes that decision clearer by indicating the amount of incoming heals on champion health bars. We're adjusting the visualization of this effect based on feedback so far (like toning down the brightness of the incoming health to make it easier to distinguish from current health); let us know if you think further changes are needed. In 10.23, we added the indicator for Evelynn's Passive - Demon Shade, Karma's W - Renewal, and Soraka's Q - Starcall heal over time both on herself and when transferred to an ally via W - Astral Infusion. And as a recap, we added the following in 10.22: Seraphine's W - Surround Sound Vladimir's R - Hemoplague, Redemption, and ARAM health packs. Some adjustments to ARAM to account for the wider item changes that are happening. And with that, we've reached the end of the 2020 season! We're listing out all the times for all regions below so everyone is crystal clear on when Ranked ends this year: If you achieved Gold or higher in Summoner's Rift Ranked Solo/Duo, Flex, or both, you'll receive Victorious Lucian (as well as Lucian himself if you don't own him yet). New to 2020, you'll also receive a Victorious chroma for each rank you hit above Gold. As a cherry on top, everyone who finished Ranked placements will receive an Eternals Lucian Series 1 Permanent (also new this year!), a Ranked profile icon, and a Ranked profile banner trim. Based on your Honor level, you will also receive the following rewards: As for Clash's End of Season (another first!), everyone who participated in any Clash tournament will receive a Clash Contender Icon. In addition, you will receive an icon, logo, and banner based on how many Victory Points you earned over the course of the season. All ranked rewards will be distributed by December 10th in all regions except CN. CN will see their ranked rewards in patch 10.24! This preseason, we're making a couple updates on the Summoner's Rift Ranked system to make sure the placement process and climb is as informed and intuitive as possible. First, brand new accounts entering Ranked for the first time will now take into account additional variables to ensure a more accurate original placement. Next, in order to smooth out progression speed bumps, we're removing promotion series for interdivision transitions. This means that going from division IV to division I for any given rank will be automatic when you reach 100 LP, and any additional LP rolls into the next division. Consequently, demotion protection between divisions will also be removed so that losing a game at 0 LP will result in moving down a division. Last but not least, we're removing the ability to duo queue at ranks Master and above to highlight competitive prowess and improve matchmaking at the top of the ladder. Another long list of League Client bugfixes and QoL changes this patch, so we're tucking them into its own section!"
10.24,2020-11-23,"Hey, is this thing on? *taps mic* Anyone still alive after the chonk of last patch? So here we are, the preseason aftermath! We bring to you a series of changes that are overwhelmingly heavy on items as we feel out the changes in the new ecosystem. Long story short: AP Mythics are strong across the board, while other items needed a bit more power to fulfill their role. So come along for the ride as we drive down the overperforming and rev up the underwhelming. You know the drill. More out of the ordinary are two new Behavioral Systems updates to mitigate the blow of disconnected players or AFKs, and a little glitzy glammy for two Void buddies! And one more thing, we also want to encourage you to revisit the 10.23 patch notes after reading through this one, as we had a LOT of updates and bugfixes since the patch first went live. So if you feel like that really crazy bug that a developer said would be fixed is missing here, it's probably documented over there. Take this portal if you're looking for TFT's patch notes! Amumu's been the clear winner of preseason, with many item changes synergizing extremely well with his kit. 10.24's initial nerfs weren't enough to bring him back in line so we've got another round. The new items and systems have pushed Amumu from strong to overwhelming. We’re pulling back some of his damage over time, which has particularly benefited from the item update. The new items give Hecarim a bit too much extra pep in his… gallop? So we’re pulling the reins on his Devastating Charge as well as the AD he gains from running fast. Reverting accidental nerfs to Kalista that was shipped in 10.23. We’re partially walking back the change to Kayle’s passive from patch 10.23 to lower her whacking stacking. With more items that grant both lifesteal and crit at her disposal, Samira poses a menacing threat in lane, even when being actively zoned out. We’re nerfing her all-in potential so that she has to think twice before charging in, gun (and blade) blazing. Tryndamere is critting less often and for less damage, so we’re amping up his damage. As a consistent high-priority pick in Pro play, Varus’ tuning has often left players feeling unsatisfied. To bring him back with vengeance, we’re shifting power away from elements that are typically strong in Pro play—such as reliable CC and lane bullying—and back into Varus’ unique playstyle of charged arrows and spellweaving. Yasuo's doubled crit chance was so powerful with Rageblade, the only correct choice was to build it first in every situation. This change addresses that excessive synergy. For full transparency: Given the interactions (like this one) we've run into so far, we're currently targeting next patch for a change that'll cause Rageblade to remove crit chance from users rather than just prevent crits. If you were wondering whether you'd have to learn the Rageblade playstyle to keep playing Yasuo in preseason, the answer is no. Same context applies here as Yasuo above! Blade of the Ruined King is overperforming compared to the other Legendaries it competes with. Dropping its power to make it look more in line with the others. Bumping up Cosmic Drive’s power to secure its position as a viable second item choice. Demonic Embrace along with Nashor’s Tooth and Lich Bane are dominating the second item slot, so we’re taking it down a notch. We’re opening jungle sustain back up for AoE casters who have been struggling with the recent changes. This comes with a small knock to the number overall, since most junglers are equipped with some form of AoE that will benefit. The AoE allowance only applies specifically to Emberknife and Hailblade. See: Emberknife. Liandry's is too strong, especially for mages that can consistently apply its damage over time effects. We’re reducing AP ratio scaling to pull back some late game power We’re toning down Lich Bane’s AP ratio, which has contributed to high-burst scenarios late game. Luden's Tempest is granting too much movement speed to champions whose mobility is meant to be a weakness. Reining in the fast and a bit of the furious by lowering its burst damage. Nashor's gives a combination of damage and a bevy of stats, which has made the item a little too strong for users that can utilize both. We’re bringing its on-hit damage more in line. Night Harvester and Rocketbelt are contributing to some of the high burst scenarios that we’re looking to tone down. See: Night Harvester. Phantom Dancer generally underperforms, especially early on. We’re putting it on discount and throwing in a utility boost to make it a more appealing early pick-up. Bringing Riftmaker down to the power of other Mythics to maintain the Mythic choice structure. Although Fang is a strong item, it hasn’t seen much action, so we’re increasing its damage to solidify it as a powerful situational choice for assassins. Tear users have taken a hit from both the new item system and the new Tear stacking. We’re increasing the rate Tear stacks to lessen its weakness. Items building from Tear have had their mana values adjusted as a result. Midlaners hold a significant amount of power across all levels of play. We think pulling a small amount of power out of this lane during early and mid-game will keep things in check, while also nerfing heavy roamers. Of note, these changes went out in patch 10.23, but were missed in the documentation—so if you’ve been counting, you’re not crazy. As we wrap up the year, we've also wrapped up the Early Surrender and LP Consolation projects we mentioned in September, which are now ready for feedback! We've implemented the following: For more details, read this article! We’re continuing to iterate on the Item Shop based on the feedback you’ve given us. As a part of that work, we're also updating over 60 icons to improve silhouette read, differentiate colors, reduce noise, and improve rendering quality. We hear and agree with the feedback that many of these icons are too difficult to identify quickly and are working towards cleaner, clearer icons. Thanks again for all your feedback! We’ve got another VFX update for you in this patch! It’s time for everyone’s favourite Void bug to skitter into the spotlight: Kha’Zix! And continuing down our Void friends, we’ve got some ear candy (SFX changes) for the Void’s eye… Once again, our goals for these sorts of smaller updates is to improve the overall gameplay clarity of VFX and SFX whilst bringing them up to modern League of Legends standards. This means that our efforts are primarily aimed at abilities which do not clearly communicate their hitbox."
10.25,2020-12-08,"We've made it through the storm and landed on the last patch of the year! Get your reading glasses and Santa hats on, because we've got a substantial list of changes from smoothing out the new landscape. And keep them on, because we’ll also be following up on balance outliers with an end-of-year “10.25b” mid-patch update to tie up all the loose ends before we ring in the holidays. Past champs and items, we're rolling out updates to Ranked initial placements and decay, bringing back Nexus Blitz with its own set of improvements, and riding Rell in, iron horse and all. And that's it! So from all of us: stay safe, stay cozy, and we'll see you in the new year. It's going to be a good one. Take this portal if you're looking for TFT's patch notes! As promised, we're doing one last round of balance changes to ensure the game is in a good state before the winter break. Again, happy holidays and we'll see you back in January! Akali was a big winner in preseason in that her win rate climbed considerably from awful to okay for most players. We've been hoping that we wouldn't need to nerf her until pro play started, but unfortunately, she's breaking ban rate limits in Elite play. Decreasing her prolonged combat damage as a result. We're rebalancing Runaan's to feel better as a second purchase. While relatively balanced, Sunfire Aegis continues to dominate tank Mythic choices. We're giving the other items more of a chance to be explored. Lead the charge with Rell in patch 10.25! Amumu's win rate was exceeding acceptable bands, to the point where we had to micropatch him in on 10.24. We're reiterating the changes here in case you missed it: With the synergy between his passive, Despair's uptime, Tantrum's resist scaling, Sunfire Aegis' unique and resistances, Demonic Embrace's burn, and Abyssal Mask's damage amplification on his R, Mummy seems to be the clear winner of preseason. Add in his buff in 10.23 when we made his ult a stun and he's been sweeping the competition off their feet. This should knock him down a peg. Anivia's been feeling out of date for a while. Though technically balanced, we thought she could use an update to her playstyle. Since she also lost a bunch of power from preseason changes, we're using this as an opportunity to fluff and buff her feathers. To make room for these modernization improvements, we're also cutting some base damage from her R so that she doesn't fly too close to the sun. Annie has seen strong success with her pick-and-burst potential. As the new season also brought a trove of Annie-friendly toys, we're toning back some of the movement that helped her run it down. Ekko's doing well in mid but is really struggling in the jungle, so we're giving him back our 10.3 nerf and a little extra. Fizz has been faring swimmingly despite his mana loss in 10.24. In combination with the overall net positive from Mythics, he's hopped over the line. Turning the tides by reverting our change in 10.23. Gragas was hit hard, especially in a post-preseason jungle with less health to guzzle. Helping him clear camps faster to soften the blow. Irelia hasn't really found a home with the Fighter Mythics yet, so we're specifically tackling the areas that will help her synergize better with existing Mythics and also handing her back some cooldown for her immediate Sheen purchase. Ivern's fallen below par and deserves quite a bit of love, especially after the shift to ability haste. To help root him as a stronger jungle pick, we're giving back some of the extra shielding power he lost from Athene's, and opening up access to more of his abilities to help both him and his allies survive fights. And we can't forget about Daisy, can we? Even with some of his lethality options catching some nerfs (see below), Jhin's still cashing out hard this preseason with pure crit builds. Giving him a direct trim. Karthus isn't performing well in any of his roles, but seems to do a lot better when getting mana out of his Mythic. We're giving him a small boost, but also expect item optimizations will improve his strength. Prior to the item rework, we buffed Kayle in preparation so that she'd have better choices in the new system. Those items ended up synergizing really well on her and have resulted in an overperformance in the mid lane. We overall like the item choices she has so we're not fully reverting the buff we did in 10.23, but are instead targeting other problem areas (her resilience in the midlane and the on-hit damage she gets when combined with Nashor's Tooth). Kayn is one of the few junglers able to fully utilize the new jungle item due to his penchant for strong basic attacking and AoE damage, increasing his overall early clear speed and power. Bringing some of his early clears back in line. Monk with no sight and no Machete means monk gets more muscle. Giving Lulu a higher success rate when hitting both Glitterlance bolts and clearing up confusion around whether her second bolt does any damage. Well, now it does! Morde became a little worse for wear after losing his Liandry's + Rylai's combo, but was at the very least propped up by Riftmaker's in 10.23. With Riftmaker nerfed in 10.24, we are looking to give some power back to Morde himself so he's not so reliant on a specific item or item combo. Morgana's DoT is making her too strong in her solo lane, especially as her opponents don't have the help of another body like in bot. Due to the changes to cooldown reduction, Nasus is finding it difficult to ramp up the frequency of his strikes. Directly reducing its base cooldown to let it scale better into the late game. Nidalee's balance state used to be extremely tied to her synergy with Runic Echoes, which was removed in the item rework. She is also running into pretty severe mana issues, due to the fact that her costs were tuned around the item. With all that in mind, we're shifting some of her power from strong mid-game farming into more champion-focused damage, as the latter is friendlier to all levels of players. Pantheon's last overhaul was aimed at bringing new life to an old top lane mainstay. With time and professional play, his rework shifted gears to mid, and then to support. While we love seeing players innovate and journey with the champion, we can't ignore the growing sentiment of folks missing the old champion they love, and we think it's worthwhile to bring Pantheon back to his original home. With that being said, the intent of these changes isn't to destroy support Pantheon, but rather to adjust that role's power, while also giving a boost to the tools that'll finally let old-school Pantheon fans successfully play him in top, and even mid lane, as promised years ago. TL;DR, we're shifting more power into a bruiser-y playstyle by giving him a higher uptime on his Q and equipping him with more selfish outputs like armor penetration at the cost of utility (i.e. strong invulnerability), slows, and most importantly, a massive movement speed boost for when he crashes onto the scene. Samira's win rate isn't over the line, but her ban rate certainly is, which indicates an issue with game health. Cutting a frustrating knock up mechanic and the hard synergy she gained with new items. Seraphine is currently feeling a lot of weakness against more aggressive opponents (i.e. Zed, Fizz, Akali) in the midlane. So much so that it's driving players away from playing her there. We're giving her a little more durability so that she can survive longer and more successfully in 1v1s. As many Shyvana players know, it's extremely frustrating to play Shyvana on any other game modes besides those on Summoner's Rift because Passive only gives her 5 bonus armor and magic resistance On other maps she has no way to fully gain from her passive! Well, we're changing that. Helping Jungle Taliyah keep up with other junglers while ensuring that her mid performance isn't overly affected. Both AP and AD Twitch are significantly underperforming. Our goals are for both to be viable ways to play him, but to stay true to his original gameplay design, we don't necessarily want his AP gameplay to be stronger than AD. For now, we're going to be buffing him in both styles of play, but it is possible that we will need further tuning adjustments as players get used to AP Twitch. Increasing Yasuo's attack speed scaling because his new itemizations don't always give him the ramp up he needs for scaling DPS. Bros for life. Yone has the same issue as Yasuo and is being tuned accordingly. Big cat and the following champs (forgive us for the non-alphabetized order here) came out of the preseason changes sorely missing the old Tiamat, so we're making adjustments for them. Rengar in particular took a massive clear speed hit, so we're bringing that back up. The loss of both Tiamat and Machete took its toll on Warwick's clear speed, and his builds are now looking very tank-heavy. Looking to buff that back up and add some more incentive for damage items. Talon's ability to roam is contingent on his ability to clear waves. And his ability to clear waves was too reliant on Tiamat. While his lethality build suffered a lot, he's starting to move out of assassin items into Goredrinker and Ravenous, so we're only giving him a small buff for now. Niche for sure, but jungle Wukong was also hit really hard, so we're adjusting accordingly. Grouping some individual item changes since most of our item changes this patch can be easily categorized by class. A couple of notes on some specific items though: Muramana has started to see play as the optimal second item for several mage champions. We're changing its effect to physical damage to incentivize its target audience to pick it up (AD casters, where ya at), while laying the groundwork for potential buffs that won't encourage more mage poaching. And Seeker's Armguard was too efficient for its cost, so we're nudging down its power. Certain junglers who get high value out of fast attacks and AoE have been significantly overperforming since preseason began, so we're paring down the power in clear speeds that were introduced in the new system. Some cleanup to support items to address some concerns: Many of our marksman champions are still weak, especially those that rely on their basic attacks to deal damage. To help with this issue, we're buffing a couple early build Legendaries so that marksman champions can scale up smoothly through midgame to eventually spike hard with Infinity Edge. Responding to feedback about champions feeling sluggish with low haste by making a few changes to some of the AP mana Mythics to improve baseline item feels. Liandry's will still be the ultimate haste option, providing up to 40 haste late game. Ornn's items will also reflect equivalent adjustments. Eclipse and Duskblade are both overperforming on ranged champions. Some more tank systemic nerfs. Slowing down Bami's power spike, especially for junglers, and pushing Mythic item strengths further apart from each other. Sunfire may be a standout in popularity, but all of them are reaching higher power levels at the moment than desired. We've been hard at work iterating on the shop and have some exciting features to share with you this time. Stay tuned - we aren't done yet and there will be more coming soon. We're continuing to iterate on the new in-game chat. This time we're focused on eliminating those pesky early line breaks. Nexus Blitz is back in 10.25, this time with a couple of changes we've made from feedback we received from last run, as well as some bugfixes: Continuing our work on Ranked to ensure that the start of season is a less frustrating experience for all players. For Diamond specifically, we're removing the complexity in the system since the tier used to have an entirely different version of decay. This new version is also more forgiving for Diamond players than the old version, in addition to being more relaxed than the rules for Master+. As outlined in our Content Refund FAQ, players with less than three refund tokens in 2020 will receive their 2021 refund token granted in 10.25! As a reminder, you only get back one refund token per year, even if you are down more than one. You can always check how many you have in the Store and read through the Player Support FAQ for more information about refund tokens."
11.1,2021-01-05,"Aaaand we're back! New year, new season, same old us, here with one last round of adjustments before Ranked kicks into gear. Keep in mind that we already took a first pass before the holidays in 10.25b, so this one is smaller in scale. Past champions and items, we've got a clarification on lifesteal (look for the yellow sword!), a spicy tweak to the unlock system for Grandmaster and Challenger, and all our best wishes as you sail gracefully through your placements. Take this portal to the last TFT patch notes before the Festival of Beasts! Fiddlesticks has been reaping too many rewards in the new jungle. Giving Gnar more target access and sticking power in his Mega form so he can have more impact beyond just hopping in and casting his ultimate. Karma has been a little too weak since the preseason changes, so we're amping up her durability. Master Yi is too powerful in Average play, so we're bumping down the amount of time he's invulnerable in team fights. A simple adjustment as Pantheon's just a tad too strong across the board. Qiyana is weak for all but the most skilled players. We're giving her some general power for when she isn't able to capitalize on clutch roams. Ryze is struggling in all roles, so we're giving him back some mana. Xayah is having a hard time right now. In addition, since Essence Reaver is now a less appealing first item for her next to Mythics, we're helping her access her key ability more often and earlier. We're giving both brothers a stronger two-item power spike. This will give them the 100% crit strike chance that they used to enjoy pre-item rework. To balance the increase in early damage, we're decreasing their overall damage output. As a reminder, Guinsoo's Rageblade was changed in 10.25 to interact differently with Yasuo and Yone's Intent passives, which also impacts their general crit power strike. We're also clarifying the excess crit strike chance to bonus AD conversion tooltip for easier comprehension. Brothers stick together; see Yasuo. We've cleaned up some champions' base stats over the years and are rounding out the remaining 99 champions. The buffs to Tear in patch 10.24 helped Tear-friendly champions across the board, but we're still looking to improve overall satisfaction for the item line. Lucidity has been weaker in preseason compared to other options. Looking to bump it up a bit. Manamune and Muramana have begun to heavily influence marksman item choices. Its value for its relative cost has made it almost always the best 2nd item choice, even rivaling Mythic items for the 1st purchase. We're adjusting Manamune's cost to open up decision-making for AD legendary items. Continuing from above! In 10.25, we limited Muramana's effect to only trigger on spells that deal physical damage to rein in its purchase on AP mages. This made champions like Ezreal and Corki sad. With other changes to Seraph's in 11.1, we believe we can lift the restriction and lower the power of the Shock passive, which is appealing to mages. We hoped that a bigger, more expensive Runaan's would appeal to more marksmen as a fourth or fifth item choice. This isn't panning out, and champs who want it as their second item are suffering from the high cost of their Mythic+Runaan's+IE core build. We're rebalancing Runaan's to feel better as a second purchase. Shurelya's has been trending weaker than the other options in the Mythic category at the same price (Mandate, Locket, Moonstone). With the other Mythics in a better spot, we're looking to bump Shurelya's up to par. We heard players' concerns that we added too much burst damage into the new items; Mythics in particular. So we're pulling back specifically on those since that's where a lot of the systemic damage was added. This is intended to keep the power level of the items neutral, trading more up-front burst for stats instead. We have noticed that system healing sources have seemed on the strong side. Pulling a systemic anti-healing lever. In the 10.23 patch notes, we incorrectly indicated that lifesteal now works on physical damage on-hit effects. To correct the record: When it comes to added damage on attacks, lifesteal applies to all effects labelled as on-hit (as denoted with a yellow sword). Currently, this type of effect is only found on items, not champions. We're continuing to iterate on the shop and chat. We can't stop. We won't stop. Ranked is back! Find the local time for your region below so you can hit the Rift running: To make the race to be the first Grandmaster or Challenger more exciting, we've changed the unlock process. Challenger and Grandmaster are still limited to the top couple hundred accounts on the server, but players must also have at least 200 LP in Master to reach Grandmaster, and at least 500 LP in Grandmaster to reach Challenger. Grandmaster and Challenger are no longer locked at the start of the season, so the race to be the first in your region starts on day one!"
11.2,2021-01-20,"Hi! A certain king has arrived, and so has another patch! Here in 11.2, we’ve made a couple changes based around healing. First, we brought the spice and everything nice for Soraka; with the last buff to Grievous Wounds, she should now be in a better spot to wish your pain away. On the other hand, folks like Aatrox and Olaf have been healing a bit too well, becoming true terrors when matched with the right items and runes. To change this, we’ve shifted their healing to be tapped straight from their kits— true healing is on the inside, right? As for items, we spruced up tank Mythics outside of Sunfire, the crowd favorite— although it's a name we all know and love, we're hoping to open the gateway to more item diversity, depending on the game state. And that’s it! We’ll see you in the next one. In the TFT world, the Festival of the Beasts mid-set has arrived! Take this portal to TFT patch notes to join in on the festivities. Bring your darkest desires to life with Viego in patch 11.2! Without her trusty Gunblade, Akali has recovered well, wielding several of the AP Mythics to her advantage instead (Night Harvester, Rocketbelt, Riftmaker). This has put her in a stronger spot than we’d anticipated, so we’re toning her down by reverting her buff from 10.23. Azir lost the cooldowns on Nashor’s Tooth and thus, some of the wind beneath his wings. We’re giving him a lift by returning some of it directly into his kit. Caitlyn’s a bit behind the curve amidst her peers, so we’re taking another shot to keep her hot on the trail. Darius has found a new friend in Stridebreaker, which allows him to execute his combo while quickly stacking his passive. We’re trimming some bonus stats from his passive to match its new consistency. Dr. Mundo has been struggling in top lane and the jungle. Giving him a bit more survivability and trading potential, and increasing his signature healing to make Mundo more *slurp* Mundo. With new items at her disposal and the buff on her Q in patch 10.23, Elise has been scaling too well. Time to wash the spider out. The nerf to Triggerseed’s AP ratio in patch 11.1 was only reflected in Ivern’s tooltips. We fixed it so it actually affects his shield now (oops). LeBlanc may be all smoke and mirrors, but right now, she’s not fooling anyone. We’re helping this Deceiver by making it less punishing when she uses her abilities and when she engages in mid- to late- game. Maokai support hit a growth spurt in the new season, and his enemies are feeling a bit… sapped. Making it so bushes around Maokai aren’t as scary. Nocturne is falling behind his jungle pals, so it's time to give his shadows, Paranoia, and all around darkness some more stage time. Nunu & Willump currently get to have their tank and eat their enemies too. We’re trimming some of their baseline stats so item decisions carry more weight and give them appropriate downsides as well. Champions like Aatrox and Olaf are able to reach a scary state with massive burst healing from items (Goredrinker and Ravenous Hydra) and runes (Conqueror and Ravenous Hunter). The moments where they feel untouchable aren’t healthy, so we’re shifting their healing to be sourced more from their kit rather than from systems. Buff axe-throwing buddy gets a similar adjustment to Aatrox. These changes should also tone down Olaf’s overall power, since he’s been chop-chopping down the competition. Aiming to support support Senna with more gold so that she can buy more items. We’re also giving her Q and attack speed stronger scaling across builds, which should open up more itemization options. Leaning just a little bit closer! into Shaco's exciting and unique points of play for stronger jungle clearing and assassination buffs. We know you’ve been licking your (grievous) wounds since its buff last patch, so we’re increased Soraka’s heal power all around. Helping the Troll King get back on his feet in the jungle and top lane, with some added power to his clear and trading. Varus is a straight shooter but he’s been behind the curve, especially with builds that aren’t attack speed heavy. Giving him a nudge up. With a new item landscape, it's time for us to add some pizazz to the pool of minion drops from Zoe’s Spell Thief. In doing this, we also removed Redemption because it offered frustrating power across the map when dropped. Essence Reaver has been a little weak, so we’re giving it a bump up for mana-hungry champions. Galeforce is outperforming the other marksmen Mythics, both in the “crit chance” space and for champions who can flex into Lethality. As such, we’re pulling back some of the power we gave Galeforce in earlier patches. While Rocketbelt's gap closing ability is its intended unique factor, it shouldn’t be the only source for engages every game. Despite a recent trip to the patch notes in 10.25, Imperial is still a strong item for solo lanes and champions with multiple CC abilities. Our priority here is to move it out of the hands of solo laners and to simplify its confusing trigger condition. Kraken Slayer is extremely powerful on champion abilities that churn out on-hits. Those abilities tend to have on-hit modifiers for this exact purpose, so Kraken Slayer will now leverage those modifiers of the following champion abilities: With the cost reduction to Chemtank, the niches for Shurelya’s and Chemtank are getting too close for comfort, so we’re differentiating the two while making it more suitable for enchanters and AP users. Given the premium price you pay for a Stoneplate, it’s not quite powerful enough, as it's very comparable to its cheaper Legendary competitors. We’re buffing up its durability stats to help you soak up all of the aggro. We’re lowering the cost of some of the utility Lethality items to create a new division of 2600 gold AD items, both for AD supports and traditional assassins. We’re adjusting some of the stats on marksman Legendary items so that they give more attack speed than their components. Sunfire Aegis has been wildly popular in contrast to other tank Mythic options, even though they seem similarly powerful in terms of win rate. The hope is that by making a separate, lower price tier for the other tank Mythic items (with each also getting a kiss and a buff), they will have more occasions where they’ll be purchased by support tanks and junglers."
11.3,2021-02-02,"Welcome to February and another big ol’ patch! This time around, we took a large sweep across items to tweak what's hitting too hard and what's needing some love, categorized into 6 sections: tank, enchanter, marksman, fighter, mage, and sustain items. For sustain, we’re continuing to reassess systemic healing by adjusting stats around Omnivamp on powerful items like Goredrinker and Sterak’s Gage. The intent here is to balance the stat’s strength while keeping items viable and, you guessed it, sustainable. Then it’s the usual champ balancing, with some sizzle for Jinx, who’s been wanting to crash back onto the scene for a while now, and some more for AP Shyv. As for outliers, we’re tamping down champs like Rammus and Elise who have been consistent hot shots in the jungle. All that aside, ARURF is back and better than ever! We've made a few changes in light of the new item landscape, so take a quick peek below and get ultra ready. See ya in the next one. Party-goers galore, festivities continue in the TFT world with our first patch of the Festival of Beasts! Take this portal to TFT patch notes to uncover where the real party is at! Since her refresh in patch 10.25, Anivia's been leaving her enemies in the cold with high spell consistency and damage. With the last round of tank item buffs, Cho's been feasting in top lane. Elise has crept to the top of the jungle echelons despite some previous nerfs (see 11.2). We're squashing her down a bit to even out the playing field. Ezreal hasn't been faring so well with the new item system. To give him more of a (mystic) shot, we're buffing his Q ratio to better synergize with Muramana, while also giving him more value when building heavy AD items like Hydra. While it's great to see Ivern wunder-ing around outside of his usual home, he's still too effective meandering around the jungle. We can't beat around the bush any longer-we're pulling back some of his safety and shielding power. The new item changes have not been kind to Jinx. We wanted to make some priority adjustments to the items in general first before tackling her, and now it's finally time. Additionally, since she's been primarily out of pro play for a while now, we're shifting some of her kit's power from raw stats to her abilities to create more room for skill expression. Bringing good karma to support Karma. Morde isn't grasping the new season well, so we're giving him more grasp. We're hoping this along with other system changes (Riftmaker giving more health, AD bruiser items getting nerfed) will help him navigate this strange new world. Olaf is dominating in the jungle. We're nerfing his clear speed and dueling slightly so he's a bit more dependent on finding successful ganks. Balancing out Pantheon's power both in mid and the jungle. Rammus rolled comfortably into preseason and has gained more momentum with the cheaper tank Mythic items. We're reducing some of his taunt power now that his engages have become more consistent. So far so good for Rell, so no meaningful balance adjustments here. These changes are light usability work and bugfixes, sprinkled with a bit of love for the very-much-not-a-thing AP Rell builds. The new season put Riven in a weak spot, and with high cooldowns on her E, she's lost her mojo. Since both of her hardbound items (Goredrinker/Ravenous Hydra) are getting substantial nerfs this patch, we're looking to reforge her spirit. Seraphine is often front and center, and with her strong stage presence in mid lane (and other roles), she's in need of some tuning down. While AD Shyvana has been tearing up the Rift with both fighter and tank builds, AP Shyv has been dragging (dragon?) behind in the new season. We want to buff AP Shyvana in ways that aren't centered around her just spamming fireballs. These changes should help her clear speed, which is weaker with the new items. Singed has been struggling since preseason, and even more so after the recent Imperial Mandate changes. We're adding some power back to his signature spell. Remember, always chase Singed. We're unshackling Sylas while also evening out his skill ranks. Taliyah's jungle surfing in Elite levels of play has been seismic. We're reverting some previous changes (11.1 and partially 10.25), while narrowing in on some specific jungle clear nerfs. Udyr is another dominant jungler at the moment, especially with a Phoenix max. His items are already getting hit, so this nerf is aimed to be lighter than what he would normally merit. Now that we've taken a couple stabs at balancing out preseason item changes, Vladimir has been left a little worse for wear. Instead of focusing buffs on his damage or healing, we're taking a different route and opening up access to his ult. We're doing a pass on mage items to create more balance amongst their purchase rates and to stop any one item from overshadowing the others (Lich Bane, Zhonya's Hourglass, Seeker's Armguard). We're also broadening Horizon Focus by lowering its activation range so that more mages can take advantage of its specialty. Lastly, we're unifying the stacking passives between Verdant Barrier and Seeker's Armguard for consistency. Zooming in on enchanter items, it’s clear that Flowing Water is largely overperforming compared to other second item choices. On the other hand, Chemtech Putrifier is fulfilling its niche role quite well (healing reduction), but it's not purchased as often or as powerful as the other Grievous Wounds items. We’re making some changes to ensure that enchanters feel they have access to a viable Grievous Wounds option as well as the other classes. Silvermere Dawn isn't as efficient for an item we think is an important piece in the fighter ecosystem, so we're upping its power. Additionally, Ironspike Whip has been helping certain champions invalidate minion waves, so we're removing the empowered damage to minions to better highlight those champions' strengths and weaknesses. We're noticing that Phantom Dancer is rarely built as a second item, and almost never as a third. Not many champions need that much attack speed, so we're reshaping what the items give to marksman champions. We're also adding more oomph to Immortal Shieldbow since it's only purchased by hard-bound short ranged users that benefit from lifesteal, and even then, it loses out often to Galeforce which does the same in most situations. When building sustain, players should be feeling the effects of a real trade-off, usually in the form of damage. However, certain items with omnivamp (particularly Goredrinker and Ravenous Hydra) are feeling particularly overpowered due to less of a trade-off in damage. We're going through and making adjustments to those items, hitting their early game power specifically. We're addressing some tank item outliers and opening Frozen Heart as a cheaper mana and ability haste item for tank supports, top laners, and junglers alike. Sign-ups and team formation for the first Clash of Season 2021 will begin during 11.3 on Monday, February 15th! The tournament will officially start in patch 11.4. Check out the Clash tab in the client for specific tournament start times and details. ARURF is back in time for the Lunar festivities. Since this is the first URF since the item changes, we're changing a few things to better fit with the new system. The intent is to allow players to build the items they want to without worrying about missing out on any value. Now, even though your starting cooldowns will be ever so slightly higher than last time URF was on, you can now build ability haste and mana items without the worry of missing out on stats… and can potentially get your cooldowns even lower than you ever could before."
11.4,2021-02-17,"Hi friends, happy 11.4! This patch, we’re looking in on bot lane, where shorter range champs like Samira have been slashing, dashing, and bashing things up. This hasn’t gone unnoticed, which is why Samira's an especially hot potato: although her win rates are fine, her ban rates are high— so we’re hoping these changes will help make her feel less frustrating to play against. Speaking of slashing, we’re also adjusting Katarina (and Urgot) to revitalize their on-hit builds, which were hit hard hard by our changes to Kraken Slayer. Other folks on the buff train due to item changes include Fiora and Lee Sin. And if this patch seems particularly buff heavy, it's because we also took a pass at bringing down the jungle's overall power. With less rewards from camps, games should feel less dictated by the strength of the jungler. Now, you can share your fruits of victory (or defeat) equally with your teammates! One more thing: there’s no new skins in this patch. 11.5 will bring with it some goodies, and it’ll be… sweet! The festival continues in the TFT world with an all new remix. Take this portal TFT patch notes to check out the changes Amumu’s always sad, but he’s particularly despondent in Skilled levels of play. We’re giving him more Tantrum damage to make him more mad than sad. The pal of the poros is getting more chances to activate his high-agency, high-impact ultimate to help turn the tides of a teamfight. Caitlyn loves a good chase, but she’s too far behind to be a reasonable counter to shorter-range marksman champions like Kai’Sa and Samira, who are currently running the meta. Reverting some previous nerfs (patch 11.2 and 10.19) to set her back on the trail. Camille's been sweeping out her enemies top lane in Elite and Pro play, so we’re reducing some of her safety and durability in lane. The new itemization and changes to fighter items (patch 11.3) left Fiora in a weaker state, so we’re sharpening her blade. Jinx is back! Her win rate seemed to go down in higher levels of play, suggesting that the 11.3 base health nerf was skewed too high. No one adapts to new items like Kai'Sa, and this season proved no exception. We’re reducing some of her damage to lower burstiness and make her less daunting in quick trades early on. After our 11.2 adjustments to make Kraken Slayer work with on-hit damage modifiers, champs like Katarina and Urgot are in need of some tuning. We’ve noticed that players really enjoy playing on-hit builds with these champions, and even if they’re not on-meta, we believe they should be viable. Prior to the Kraken changes, a significant number of Katarina’s and Urgot’s builds were on-hit, but they also had significantly lower win rates in comparison to their traditional build. These changes should bring those builds up to roughly where they were before. Similar to Katarina, we’re bumping up Urgot’s on-hit builds to feel less bad with Kraken. Lee’s also been struggling with the new items, and could use some buffs to push him towards his visions of zooming around the map. Renekton is a strong croc who can propel through lanes with high sustain, so we're paring some of that down. As it stands, our desert rose has consistently been warming the ban bench. Even when technically close to balanced, we believe she has several frustrating attributes that contribute to her high ban rate. We’re tackling this problem by giving her some balance tweaks so that both Samira players and her opponents feel more comfortable having her back in the ring. To do this, we’re reducing the power of her defensive tools and giving opponents more opportunities to play against her in lane. We’re also reducing her all-in potential early game. In exchange, we’re improving her kill potential mid to late game, so that when she does go in, she slays. The last of his kind is the top of the jungle. Pulling back a bit of defensive power so Skarner can rest his weary claws. Another sight for sore eyes, even with our last set of buffs in 11.2. We lend our aid to Soraka. Talon has been struggling to get his blades on people, so we're letting him have some more access to his tools at range. Tryndamere’s been weak in lane, so we’re bringing our furious fellow’s base AD up to help him out. We’re giving more incentive for Varus to fully charge his Q in combat. Extra juicy for lethality and crit builds. Veigar has fallen a little short of other mid laners in 2021. Giving him a boost so he can stand face-to-face with the competition. Guinsoo's has fallen behind crit itemization for a bunch of champions who historically had more choice here. Giving it a slight bump so it can be a more meaningful consideration. Moonstone is crowding out choice and generally overperforming, especially when purchased very early and starts snowballing. We’re reducing some of its early healing power. While Grievous Wounds are meant to be a reactive purchase, they are performing below expectations. Buffing their stats a bit so that the tradeoff between other Legendary items is less sharp. We’re changing a couple of the under-purchased mage items so they have more opportunities to shine. Cosmic Drive's passive is now more accessible, while Everfrost now has a new build path and a few small buffs. We've seen junglers have a bit more control over games, in large part due to their increased purchasing power early game turning into combat stats, which then accelerates their experience and gold growth. We’re pulling back on their experience and income a bit to compensate. As a result of these changes, we’re holding off on nerfing some borderline OP jungle champions until we see how these changes shake out. After seeing the incoming healing tech live for some time, we’ve come to a few conclusions: Incoming healing is very satisfying for the player using it and their allies, but it can hurt clarity around how much health enemies have in tense combat situations. We also found that when combined with shields and grey health, the stacked bars could be a bit confusing. We’re making a few changes this patch to address this, and we’re planning to roll out the tech to more systems in the future (i.e. health potions and Mundo’s ultimate). More updates so you can wipe out the store and the competition. Alongside the Clash 2021 Season VP track starting in 11.4, you will see the second iteration of our Build-a-Team feature in Clash. This version will allow players to find and request to join teams that are looking for more players to fill out their roster. This should help turn your roster of 3 or 4 players into a 5 person meme dream team to crush the Clash tournament with."
11.5,2021-03-02,"11.5, how time flies! Let’s spring into it. First: the jungle, the mighty jungle. Champs like Master Yi and Sejuani have been in a bit of a jam, while others like Udyr and Rammus have been on full tilt, rampaging around the map. We’re giving the former more of a sting, and putting on the brakes for the latter. Then: items! We're adding more rules to Guinsoo's Rageblade and providing clarification for its synergy with Senna. We're also helping Muramana out of its identity crisis with Essence Reaver by giving it more of a niche. So sharpen your stingers, buzz onto the Rift, and make a beeline down mid. See ya next patch. And for those of you with melissophobia (a fear of bees) you can take this portal TFT patch notes to check out the bee-free TFT scene! We're disabling all Riot-created pro player accounts created after January 7th, 2021 to address unintended differences in LP gains/losses which resulted in an unfair advantage over non-pros in reaching the top of the ranked ladder. These accounts will decay out of the ladder over the next few weeks. Pro accounts created before Jan 7 are unaffected. Pros will be given replacement accounts with fixes made to the starting MMR. This update has already begun and may take a few days to complete. Balancing out Azir’s steady power curve throughout the duration of a game by pecking down his early lane control. Pushing back the beefed-up top lane Gragas by increasing the ticket price on his barrels. Jacked up Jax packs the max attacks with Trinity! (Try to say that three times fast.) Despite buffs in patch 11.3, support Karma is still in low spirits. We took a look at some of the more recent changes to her and are reigniting her fire by partially reverting the nerfs from 10.16. Once upon a time, when tanks and fighters only built armor Legendaries like Sunfire Cape and Randuin’s Omen, Kog’Maw was much more able to dissolve defenses and have lower cooldowns. To give him more of a payoff, we’re amping up the zip in his spit so that when the ability is up, he can charge! bugle noises With the last set of nerfs in patch 11.1 and jungle changes, Master Yi had found himself in a tough spot. Putting the alpha in his strike to help all his builds and playstyles, especially those more reliant on attack speed. Tamping down mid Pyke's sustain in order to bring support Pyke up from the undertow. Qiyana’s power tends to rely on early roams. This has shaped her to be the Elite pick of choice, where players have been able to use her roaming prowess to their full advantage without running into the coordinated safety usually seen in higher-tier games. To bring her more opportunities for royal success, we’re giving her more baseline scaling and encouraging an earlier W max. You know, for crushing. Rammus has been more armor than arma(dillo), particularly in Average levels of play. Rolling down some of his durability so he has to be more careful before barrelling into fights. Rell is dominating the pro scene, so we’re giving her opponents a fighting chance by making her more vulnerable to harass. Samira is struggling to keep up after her nerfs last patch, so we’re upping this thrillseeker’s scaling so that she can continue to slay when late game rolls around. Sejuani has been bristling in the new jungle. We’re giving her and her boar an extra juicy treat for hitting both parts of her W. Seraphine’s still all over our radars and radios, so we’re softening the blow from the Notes coming from allies, while turning up the power on her own Notes. This way, she can continue to be impactful on her own without over-amplifying through the strength of her fans. Shaco has been spooking the bejeezus out of bot lane but he’s been clowning around in the jungle, so we’re adjusting accordingly. We’re helping the troll king sink his teeth into the new season with a little extra bite in top and jungle. AP rat is strong, AD rat feels wrong. Recalibrating. With the help of new items like Turbo Chemtank, Udyr has been zooming around the jungle with nary a care with some of the fastest movement speeds we've ever seen, letting him nyoom in and out of fights. We’re dialing back his clear speeds (revert of a 10.21 buff) and making him squishier. After tinkering with Viego for a while, we’ve pulled together a few significant bugfixes that should add up to a slight nerf. Muramana heavily overlaps with Essence Reaver, both in stats and use cases. To better differentiate between the two, we’re changing Muramana’s proc to focus more on empowering abilities, whereas Essence Reaver empowers auto attacks through abilities. Stridebreaker's dash didn’t feel as powerful as its slash, so we’re balancing both while aiming for a power-neutral change. Certain champions, like Senna, benefit too much from Guinsoo’s Rageblade when you consider the fact that its crit strike chance can scale over 100% and it ignores crit damage modifiers. We’re adding some rules to it to circumvent these edge cases, allow for more item diversity with those champions, and help us better tune the item to be usable for more of the roster. Speaking of Senna, now, her passive can no longer give her above 100% crit strike chance, and any excess crit is converted into lifesteal at the same rate. Serpent’s Fang is a powerful but underwhelming and confusing item, so we're making it more broadly usable. Imagine Grievous Wounds for shields, but with extra profits! Dropping Maw's price to be a more attractive and affordable defensive option. Adjusting Black Cleaver to be better suited for longer fights while packing it with more punch for its cost. The shop continued to assimilate knowledge at an alarming rate and has reached a new level of awareness. (It keeps asking us to nerf Ornn.)"
11.6,2021-03-16,"11.6 and school’s in session! But have no fear, your handy dandy cheat sheet here: the big snapshots of this patch include a refresh button for Xin Zhao and an overall reduction targeting systemic healing (i.e. from runes and items). Staying alive is one thing, but it’s a problem when certain champs start feeling invincible. Once you’re done hitting the books, hit the rift, ace the enemy team, and school your opponents. We’ll see ya next period patch. And for those of you who hate studying, take this portal to TFT patch notes to check in on a universe where school’s out forever. These changes were included in the original patch deploy, but left off of the original Patch 11.6 Notes! From the start of most games, Akali is able to wield her durability to help her coast through even the most difficult early lane phases. We’re reducing her early game tankiness so that her laning success isn't always guaranteed, but in return, we’re giving her an overall net buff with later dueling payoff, so that when she strikes, it’s deadly. In addition, we're also making her energy management more intuitive so that if you’re just now picking her up, it doesn’t take so much… energy? Despite being mini, Gnar has been mega in Pro play, so we’re pulling back on his in-lane harass. Hecarim has been at peak pony in the jungle for a while, especially with tankier builds. By lowering his base damage, he’ll have to sacrifice some heft to deal more harm. Karthus is particularly temperamental to changes in the meta, so he’s become a familiar face in the patch notes. This time around, with players refining his optimal builds, he’s crept back into the spotlight in Elite play, so we’re bringing down his damage. LeBlanc has been feeling chained down and could use some help finding success. We’re opening up more opportunities for her to dash in and out of a kerfuffle. Since she entered the ring, Lillia has managed to prance her way out of any nerfs while still remaining a staple in professional play. With many of her competitors falling out of favor, it's time for her to get Eep!ed. Her ultimate has AoE fight-changing capabilities, so we're bumping up its cooldown to reflect its potency.. Pyke has been in the deep end ever since we submerged mid Pyke in 11.5. Now that there isn’t a huge skew towards mid over support, it’s finally time to help him resurface by giving him a rankup that has some oomph. As a strong pick for late-game survivability in skirmishes and teamfights, this croc has been up and down the block in Pro play. We’re cutting down his late-game tankiness so that his enemies have a fighting chance to find his Achilles’ scale. Sylas has been feeling underwhelming and boxed in, and he’s at a point where we feel comfortable breaking him out. Giving him more opportunities to slip, slap, and slash, without breaking the (healing) bank. The change to Urgot in patch 11.4 was meant to make squishier Kraken Slayer off-builds more viable, but he’s veered off course, scuttling over to rush Titanic Hydra instead. We’re reverting his on-hit modification to steer him away from the off-build altogether and help him hone back in to his primary build. There have been reports of bears, horses, and deer running amok in the jungle, but after thorough investigation, Volibear has been deemed innocent of all jungle gap wrongdoing. If anything, he's been the victim. We're waking him out of his jungle hibernation to enjoy the new season. We're shipping two sets of changes to Xin at once: One focused on his core AD fighter build and one to open up an AP off-build. This is a long one, so to make it less of a Xin ow, we’ve broken his patch notes up accordingly. First, the AD Xin we all know and love: a Demacian warrior with a strong spirit and an even stronger spear. As a brawler who uniquely excels at skirmishes, we’re sharpening his distinctive strengths by giving him tools to extend combos and initiate duels. With new, creative ways to get to his enemies, he’ll feel more empowered or, dare we say, audacious, to dive into teamfights and skirmishes. But wait, what if Xin wants to change things up a bit? Put down the spear and don a wizard hat instead? Before his rework, AP Xin Zhao occasionally made the rounds as a fun off-build with a distinctly different playstyle from his AD counterpart. These changes are geared towards bringing AP Xin back into play, but we still expect his AD-focused builds to come out on top. The amount of systemic healing—or healing from runes and items—is still trending high, so we’re shifting some of the power from burst healing into other areas. We’re aiming to open up more potential AP Mythics by making Liandry and Luden’s more usable across mages. These changes should entice burst mages to pick it up when facing tanky team comps. Like Liandry’s above, we’re adding another AP Mythic to the mix. This should be a better option for mages who deal damage over time. Looking to make Rabadon’s a more snug and budget-friendly fit as a third purchase. Seeker's Armguard and Verdant Barrier have been doing their job a bit too well, keeping AP scaling champs too safe as the laning phase progresses, which masks their intended weaknesses and contributes to a particularly dull meta. We’re adjusting the strength of these mid-tier items, while retaining the power level of the Legendary items they build into (Zhonya’s Hourglass and Banshee’s Veil). Seek up to Seeker’s! Like the above, we’re nudging down Verdant’s power while keeping its final item strength. By the numbers, Moonstone Renewer has been the dominating choice among enchanters, so we're buffing Battlesong to be an even catchier tune than it already is. It’s time for Stridebreaker to take a break. Strangely, Stridebreaker had a longer cooldown than Ironspike, so we’re rectifying that. We’re also bringing down its cost to account for its power loss. Now that players are starting to realize other tank Mythics are reasonable options, we feel comfortable giving back some of Sunfire’s oomph, considering it has been the worst performing item among its peers for a while. With a strong passive and low cost, we’re making it worse as an early rush item. The last set of jungle changes took a sufficient amount of experience out of the jungle, so we're refunding some of it with a buff to Smite (below) and good ol’ Gromp. This should now fix a certain route to help junglers get to level 3 after 3 camps, and keep them alive. Alongside Gromp’s buff and the hit to Ravenous Hunter, we’re adding an extra healing bump by giving some base healing to make it less treacherous for the junglers who are less tanky and struggle to sustain themselves. Addressing unintuitive and frustrating scenarios around Teleport, such as Teleporting and zooming right back into lane after an early death. In compensation, we’re giving it a buff to maintain its power as a playmaking tool. Although useful on a number of champions, this rune is a bit too generous with its sustain for AP champions, so we’re targeting that. Another change under the umbrella of healing adjustments: Ravenous has been standing out as a strong rune of choice for secured sustain, so we’re giving it a tap down. The shop is pretty certain it can hit Gold this year if it puts the hours in. In the meantime, here are some updates. After Zaun, the next Clash tournament will be... Noxus-themed! The first weekend will be March 20th and 21st, and the second weekend will be April 3rd and 4th. Team formation for the first weekend will be open starting on March 15th. Last year, we published an article that talked about the upcoming change and rollout for DX11, and it’s finally here! In case of issues during the rollout, we've given players the option to fallback to DX9, which can be found in the League Client settings > Game Options > Prefer DX9 Legacy Mode."
11.7,2021-03-30,"If you're still in the winter blues, don't you fret—we're cranking up the tunes to take you on an interstellar groove. First, it's off to the Freljord, where we're getting cozy with a couple of chilly companions (Ashe, Braum, and Lissandra). Then we're heading down to Bandle City to turn down Tristana's Boomer-box and pass the mic to Teemo, because we could all use a taste of terror from time to time. We even made the dreary trek to the Shadow Isles to lift Yorick's spirits—who would've known he's a big fan of soul music?—and give him some love that's been long overdue. Our last pit stop was to bot lane, where we adjusted the knobs on three supports who have been overpowering their peers. Throw in some item changes and you've got the gist of this patch! Shuffle on over to the Rift, and we'll see ya in the next one. If space disco isn't your thing, take this portal to TFT patch notes to tune into the Festival of Beasts' lo-fi sci-fi beats! Alistar has been thwacking his enemies (and his bell) in Pro and other levels of play. As one of the top three tank supports at the moment alongside Rell and Thresh, he's able to bring too much beef for his damage and threat potential. We're giving his damage a ding down to make his output more reasonable. Since his explosive preseason debut, Amumu has slipped back to being a miserable mummy, especially in Skilled and Elite play. We're giving him more access to his spells to let him tear up, this time in happiness and in the jungle. In comparison to her fellow marksmen, Ashe has been feeling left out in the cold. We're lowering the cooldown on her ultimate to let our Warmother make aggressive plays more often. With other melee supports icing out our mustached man, Braum's heart needs a warm buff. We're giving Braum more opportunities to jump in to protect his friends (and poros). Despite our adjustments in 11.6, Hecarim's still one hecking huge horse and it's clear we undershot the bar. This time, we're targeting a standout frustration: his ability to hoof it across the map, gallop into a gank, and steamroll his targets. To rein him in, we're lowering the cap on his upfront burst and gap-closing potential. With Daisy's bugfix in 11.6 and its subsequent boost in damage, everything's been coming up roses for Ivern. We're cutting down his mid-game damage so that when he's able to snowball, his enemies aren't completely rolled over. Kai'Sa's strength lies in striking when the iron's hot: dashing to isolated enemies to burst them down, then sidestepping just as quickly. Her ult adds another level of safety, especially early game, so we're targeting its uptime to give opponents a chance to catch her in lane. Kindred could use a helping paw, so we're giving this duo a love tap by giving their abilities a little more uptime and a little more oomph. Yet another Freljord friend who's been struggling amongst her peers—we're returning some power back to the Iceborn to help her knock her enemies down cold. Despite our buffs to him in 11.3, Morde is still on the weaker side, namely in his upfront damage and sustain. Giving him more power to obliterate his foes. Rell brings strong peel and lockdown power that sets up her team a bit too well. We're taking a swing at the duration of her highly reliable CC to keep her and her allies from constantly and consistently pulling off CC chains. Small shroom aficionado gets a sizable buff to remind us what true terror feels like. Instead of space tunes, Thresh has been belting his sweet tones of misery across Pro and Elite levels of play. Players have been finding the most success around builds that max his lantern second, so we're cranking that down a notch. Tristana has rocket jumped to the top of Pro levels of play. We're taking a shot at her early game damage. Equipped with strong early clearing, dueling, and four eternal spirits, Udyr's been running the jungle. We're curbing the damage output across his builds to give peers the chance to start off on the right foot. If you ordered another underperforming marksman in distress, you're in luck—we've got Varus. Giving him some much-needed power that should help him feel more like a full combo rather than a sad side of fries. We left Yasuo feeling winded from our nerfs to Immortal Shieldbow in 11.6, so we're partially walking back our adjustment to help him catch his breath. Yorick is usually able to crush his way through average play, but recently, he's fallen behind. In addition to his absence from higher-tier games, he has room for a buff to help him across levels of play, so we're taking a first pass by making his E more satisfying and effective. Coupled with some QoL adjustments, this should help our shepherd feel less wretched, while also evening out his performance in higher levels of play. Essence Reaver is overperforming amongst peers in its class, and then some. Essence should still feel like an appropriate buy, but rushing it shouldn't be as efficient as it currently is. Since the changes in 11.4, Everfrost has been ever-present on the Rift. It's cool that players have found interesting ways to utilize all three Mythics, but Everfrost's damage was a little too high for its lockdown power, so we're bringing that down. Lord Dominik's Regard has quickly caught on as the go-to second purchase for marksfolk. We're adjusting it so it's no longer a catch-all item, but rather something to be picked up specifically for facing tanky terrors. We've gotten over our grudge. Making Serylda's more accessible for assassins. Trinity Force went a bit too heavy on attack speed, which cut it off from a larger audience. In turn, we're forcing a new hand of stats (and Mythic passive!) that should make it feel like a real contender for more users. Turbo Chemtank quickly broke speed limits and our expectations, so we're shifting some power from its zoom to its sloom. We've made updates to the Summoner's Rift Ranked LP formulas and general skill detection to provide smoother LP gains and losses across the board. These changes will help ensure players receive LP at a more predictable rate, and outlier gains or losses will be less frequent."
11.8,2021-04-13,"Hi, welcome back! This patch, we’ve got something for everyone. If you’re looking for something cutting-edge, we’ve got the snip-snap from Gwen, who’s weaving her way over to the Rift. Sick of the galactic beats of last patch? Rammus has a new slammin’ jam, complete with a polish to his trusty armored shell. Did your spring cleaning and in need of something sparkly? Perfect, because we’ve adjusted some Mythics for you to get your grubby little enchanter hands on. Or perhaps you’ve missed playing some champs in their trusty old lanes, like a certain very accredited, very purple doctor, or maybe even a flaming hot yordle. Looks like you’ll have to read on to find out. See ya in the next one. Come one, come all, to the TFT patch notes before the set ends and the Reckoning begins! These updates were included in the original patch deploy, but left off of the original Patch 11.8 Notes! Gwen snips, skips, and slashes into 11.8 on April 15th. Lately, Annie’s been blazing down her foes. By increasing the cost on her W, she’ll have to be more careful when deciding whether to burn up minions or enemy champions. Aphelios has been looking pale ever since we nerfed his interaction with Kraken Slayer in 11.2. Given how he’s fallen behind other scaling marksmen, we're putting more punch into his lethality rank-ups (which have been historically lackluster), along with his weapon effects during his ultimate, to let him reach for the moon. Cass has been coiled up tight with Tear of the Goddess, as she relies on its mana in mid and late game teamfights. This dependence has caused her to suffer both in power and freedom in item diversity, so we’re scaling down her need for it. At present, jungle Mundo’s been smashing, and top lane Mundo’s been crashing. We’re tackling this by pulling back on his clear speeds, which should slow his roll without stopping our purple friend from cleaving through the jungle. We’re then doctoring up Lane-do by tossing him more regen to make him the meaty meatball of his dreams. We shubbanuffa’d ourselves by giving Gnar too loose a leash, and now he’s been throwing temper tantrums all over the map. We’re pulling back accordingly. LeBlanc is a master trickster known for her ability to bop in, burst down, and bop back out— but as of late, her burst has felt more deceitful than fatal. We’re giving Lee Sin more clear to help him keep an eye on other top junglers. Our lady of clockwork has become the staple mid lane mage in Pro play. Armed with both safe early game laning and strong mid-to-late game teamfight power, she’s a reliable source of utility and damage without much of a tradeoff. To even things out, we’re tapping down her early durability in the early phases of the game. In conjunction with his release in Wild Rift, we’re celebrating Rammus with a mini visual update! Along with new sound and visual effects, we’re armoring this ‘dillo with a new ult that rewards him for going fast and vaulting into enemies to create the perfect impact. Although mid Rumble’s been doing well, he’s been feeling rather tepid up in top lane. We like supporting both sides of the yordle, so we’re finding a middle ground in power for both roles by making top Rumble better at beating down tankier targets, while making mid Rumble more vulnerable, particularly when laning against mages. Thresh is still thriving as one of the top supports, so we’re tightening the chains on one of his most versatile tools. As a champ who used to rush item components for CDR, but can no longer do so with the new Mythic item structure, Vlad has been thrown for a loop. To compensate, we’re pumping down his cooldown. Well, we did it. We woke Yorick up and brought him back to life… and right over the balance line. To mitigate, we’re following up his patch 11.6 buffs by walking back some of his damage—but we don’t want to leave him back in the dirt. So we’re also adding the second part of his intended changes to help his Maiden stay alive. Instead of constantly trying to keep her out of harm’s way, our premier split pusher can now focus on destroying turrets with his minions of the Mist. Between last season’s changes to jungle camp health and Bami’s Cinder, Zac lost a lot of his mid-game clear speed. We’re putting the glob back on the job by slinging him more damage, along with a buff for AP bruiser builds. We’re bringing some fringe junglers and popular champions up to actually viable levels in the jungle. While we've done passes on a number of these champions before, we're more confident that these changes will give them safe and competitive clears that should be fun for those itching for a test run. With Moonstone Renewer as the only Mythic that truly fulfilled enchanter’s dreams, they haven’t had much of a selection to choose from. To expand their horizons and inventories, we’re adjusting the following items to be picked up based on the situation at hand: Moonstone for more heals and shields, and Shurelya’s for more nimble feet and aggressive plays. We don’t want to overload the game with movement speed, so we’re also pivoting Staff of Flowing Water to focus from fast zooms to AP booms. Frozen Heart’s been getting looked over in the tank item department. Have some heart (and more armor, while you’re at it). We set out to make Chemtech Putrifier a more sought after choice for supports by substantially broadening its use cases. First and foremost, we’re making it so you have to target an ally to receive the benefits yourself (much like Ardent Censer and Staff of Flowing Water). The ability to apply it to oneself didn't seem to have significant power implications, but it did have odd interactions (like with Ravenous Hunter) that were not intended. In addition, we’re giving the item a slight buff because it's still a bit niche and underperforms compared to other options. These kicks have become very popular in Pro play, crowding out other footwear options in the jungle. We’re slapping on a higher price tag since their cost is a contributor to an unsustainable jungle meta centered around fast clears and fast ganks at low costs. Night Harvester tends to be purchased more and performs better than Rocketbelt, even by one of the item’s intended audiences—champions who aim to assassinate single targets. We’re bringing it back into style by sharpening the differences between the two items. Shifting its power away from early game and low-health builds. Get ready to Arise! with your team, because this round of Clash is Shurima themed! The first weekend will be April 17th and 18th, and the second will be May 1st and 2nd. Team formation for the first weekend open on April 12th. Each season, we add new chromas for Medieval Twitch and Grey Warwick to keep the rewards coming for League's most sportsmanlike players who reach Honor 5 season after season. When you open your Honor 5 capsule, you'll receive one Honor 5 token that can be redeemed for Medieval Twitch, Grey Warwick, one of these new chromas, or a previously-released chroma. You have to own Medieval Twitch or Grey Warwick before you can unlock one of their chromas, but you don't have to own them both. Honor 5 capsules also contain a random emote or ward skin."
11.9,2021-04-27,"Flowers are blooming, birds are chirping, and it’s our favorite time of the year— Midseason! This one's a bit of a doozy, so let's give you a rundown. First, we’ve got a shakeup to the tank system with the nerf of Turbo Chemtank and buffs to a few underpowered fighter items (Death’s Dance and Wit’s End). Then, in preparation for MSI, we’re shuffling up the meta for Pro play by bringing a diversified crew onto the stage. This means dominant names like Gragas take a step back to let old friends like Shen and Lulu try some time in the spotlight. Past these, we overshot on a few champions last patch who quickly grew to be main offenders on the Rift. Folks like Diana and Morgana, whose newfound power helped them settle too comfortably in the jungle, are getting taken down a peg while preserving strength in the role. The same goes for a certain red reaper and a magenta meatball in their respective lanes. What else? Taric’s interaction with certain champs gets updated so that he no longer applies benefits to allies that aren’t on the map. Viego gets a lot of bugs out of his system. The second leg of Ranked begins, and you make it to the tier of your dreams. And that’s it! We’ll see ya in the next one. TFT: Reckoning has arrived, and we reckon you'll want to check the TFT patch notes before the Black Mist corrupts us all! Our buffs to Diana's passive in 11.8 helped her rise up the ranks in mid and jungle. Players are enjoying the spice she brings to the jungle, so we're gently pulling back on her clear speeds and in lane durability. Our 11.8 buffs to top Mundo brought him back into the spotlight and then some. Once he hits late game, he reaches an oppressive state where it feels impossible to get through his purple hide. We’re following up by taking out some of his tankiness and threat potential to let his opponents take bigger chunks out of his meaty exterior. With efficient stacking on his W without requiring much in return, Garen’s been able to have his beef and eat it too. We’re pushing down his spike in his tankiness so that his power curves more smoothly after picking up a Mythic item. Gragas is currently a triple threat in Pro levels of play, guzzling casks in jungle, support, and top lane. Nudging down one of his more vital spells in lane. Hecarim is still at a wild gallop in the meta, more often meeting the ban hammer than his foes. Then once he’s able to make it into a game, he’s typically confined to a full-tank build. In order to fix this two-part problem, we’re trotting down some of his upfront burst and early durability. We’re also giving more incentive for damage-oriented builds for a powerful pony rather than the same old beefy bronco. Heimerdinger is overperforming in top, mid, and bot lane at high levels of play. Giving him a ding down. Jinx was doing way more splash damage than she was supposed to with Fishbones. It’s fixed now, but it’s a big enough drop in damage that we’re noting it here. Shadow Assassin Kayn has been overshadowing his Darkin counterpart, so we’re bringing that part of Kayn… out of the dark. Kindred is continuing to struggle in the jungle, so we’re giving them a stronger mid-game power spike. Kog'Maw has been in a cocoon more than he’s been in the bot lane, so we’re giving him more ooze to get back in the groove. In addition, we're helping him burn through more enemies that dare stand in his way... or in his spit. We're buffing Whimsy to give Lulu a pinch more power earlier in the game. Although we still think she’s a great new addition to the jungle, our 11.8 buff to Morgana was stronger than intended, so we're partially walking it back. Rumble is heating up in the mid lane, specifically against squishier melee targets, so we’re hitting an all-too-reliable source of his damage so his enemies have a chance to cool down. Our damage-binding adjustments to Sett in 10.18 reduced the effectiveness of his full-tank builds, which made him less of a menace in mid, jungle, and support. With a reduced threat of him flexing across different positions, we can now let him flex more damage. With only base values and a token AP ratio, Shen’s ult feels more like a bubble than a shield, making it too unreliable for protecting squishy allies when they get caught out late game. We’re adding another ratio to make his scaling considerably better and to help him feel more empowered to protect his friends late game. Taking some of the mana burden off of our knight in shining crystal. The 8.18 nerf to Trundle’s pillar’s slow put the brakes on his ganking and ability to find picks, and our follow-up in 10.2 just didn’t cut it. With more slow from the get go, we’re making it easier for Trundle to be the zoning troll on a roll. Our last buff brought Vlad back into the role of a scaling powerhouse—maybe a little too much so. We’re partially pulling back on his 11.8 adjustment to find a sweeter middle ground. Our resident laser-sniper has been in a confusing state, having more of a blast as a support than as a mid laner. By re-tuning his scaling to favor level and gold scaling, this should help energize mid Xerath. Dead Man’s Plate is dominating as a second item choice for a wide range of champions, including tanks, fighters, and juggernauts. We're reducing its raw defensive stats to highlight its unique mobility passive. Death’s Dance has been a step behind its peers, so we’re bumping up its raw efficiency to bring it back in full swing. Our adjustments to Moonstone in 11.8 left the item weaker than other options for supports, so we’re returning some power back to its base healing, which should feel even more satisfying when combined with its heal and shield power. We’re adjusting the way Prowler’s Claw’s active targeting works to make it more user-friendly and forgiving, as it’s been more challenging to use in some kits than intended. We’re not increasing the item’s actual range, but now if you misclick slightly while trying to cast it in the middle of your combo, Prowler’s will hit the target you probably meant to click on instead of doing nothing. In the olden times, there was a sunnier era, or dare we say, a Sunfirey era. That was until the Chemtanks crushed all who would dare oppose them. We’re bringing back the fire by helping Aegis melt down its enemies once more. With Turbo in tow, junglers are able to consistently engage and gank as they gallop in from across the map, so we’re putting it on a tighter leash. For such a niche item, Wit's End lacks oomph, even when picked up in the right scenario. Adjusting the build path and adding more damage should make it feel more powerful all around and appeal to more champions. We're rolling into the second split of Ranked on Sunday, May 2 at 11:59 PM local time for your region! Emerge victorious from this Split with exclusive rewards including a Gwen summoner icon, Gwen emotes, and a Series 1 Eternals Capsule. Clash continues! We've got more dates for you and your team to keep an eye on:"
11.10,2021-05-11,"Hi! Now that things are settling down after Midseason, we come bearing the meatiest part of this patch: a jungle update! There’s a big section you can scroll on down to, but the gist of it is that we’re making improvements to help the jungle experience feel less like a grind of swatting down camps of birds and wolves. We’re talking more lenient camp timers, a helping hand for junglers who are significantly behind in the game, and specific adjustments to jungle camps. Zooming back to balance changes, a certain axe man and a blade babe have been crossing the line, so we’re taking them down a notch. On the other end, we’re giving some love to a luminous lady and a wingwoman who haven’t been feeling their best. Phase Rush, a safe bet for ranged and melee users, gets a nerf, whereas Abyssal Mask gets a buff to secure it as a more potent MR option. Last but not least, Kog’Maw gets a VFX update, so prepare to be open-mouthed for a brushed up Mouth of the Abyss! (But not for too long— I hear he spits.) And that's it! See ya in the next one. Take this portal to the TFT patch notes to see what's in the cards for the first patch of TFT: Reckoning! Bard's been overperforming at higher tiers of play due to his roaming capabilities. Obviously, it's Bard. Bard roams. So to preserve his unique strength as a roaming support, we're toning down his early lane damage instead. Darius has been chopping up his foes left, right, and across levels of play. With high win rates in Elite and high ban rates in Average tiers, we're looking to make Apprehend less oppressive by giving his opponents more opportunities to farm or mount a counter-attack. Galio's been soaring high as a mid laner and support in Elite play. His shield is where a large part of the problem lies. With an early max, Galio’s durability remains strong throughout the course of the game, so we're giving his shield appropriate downtime and scaling to match. Despite Jinx's bugfix-nerf in 11.9, she’s still at the top of the marksmen heap. In addition to her big ol' deadly rocket to snipe objectives, she’s a safe pick to handle most scenarios. We’re making her more vulnerable to enemies who want to shut her down early on, then pulling back on a super mega frustrating point of her ult. Katarina’s been terrorizing Skilled play, so we're adjusting her roaming prowess due to the impact it can have on higher-leveled matches. Kayle is a little weak across all levels of play, so we’re strengthening her moment of transformative ascension at level 16 so she can rain down damage from above. This ninja’s lost his spark. We’re charging up the current in top lane. Our laser lady has been underperforming in mid and support, so we're putting more zap in her waveclear to help Lux players in the mid lane, as well as the support Lux players who tend to play more aggressively in the bot lane. We’re updating Sejuani’s targeting so that she knows which boarbullseye to strike. Talon’s been raking it in as the premier mid lane roamer in Elite play. He’s able to pack a punch in lane, then dash and slash his enemies in the next lane over. We’re slowing down his roll by lowering some of his upfront burst and dialing down how much he spikes for each successful gank. We tried to chain down Thresh in patch 11.8, but the Warden’s still keeping his enemies prisoner in Elite play. We’re lowering his early durability so that he’ll be more susceptible to all-ins. It appears that the bot lane is full of dog people because Yuumi’s been a less ideal partner for marksman champions due to her more passive presence. To coax her back as a more active participant in lane, we’re giving her some damage from the outset so that her Q feels more like poke than a pat. Feeding Zyra’s plants more power and uptime so she gets more bang for her... bud. At all phases of the game, Abyssal Mask is getting overlooked in favor of more powerful defensive options. It could use some raw power to compete against its peers. Goredrinker has been on the weaker end of things for a while now and has been phasing out of fighter builds. Giving it a fighting chance by bumping up its healing. Guinsoo’s has been in a rough spot, so we’re making it a more affordable option for on-hit champions to ramp up their damage earlier on in the game. We're speeding up Riftmaker's stacking time and broadening the ways to trigger the stacking for a more satisfying and expected feel during combat. Phase Rush dominates high-level play with its ability to provide safety both in lane and in extended fights. We're pumping the brakes for users across the board. We know a few champions are very tied to Phase Rush, and we'll be monitoring them closely over the patch and follow up as needed. Throughout patch notes history, the jungle has been changed in ways that have pushed PvE prowess to the highest levels of importance, where the priority is to farm fast to get ahead of the experience curve. This is even more pronounced in higher levels of play, where the champion pool has narrowed down to those with competitive clearing capabilities, making the jungle a solved system and a scary place when you fall behind. To address this, we’re relaxing camp timers to allow for more leniency on pathing through the jungle. We’re also reinstituting an improved version of the comeback experience which only kicks in when a jungler is significantly behind the game— now, if that’s the case, it shouldn't feel impossible to win. The intent isn’t so that a strategy is born out of the comeback mechanism, but instead to limit the number of games that feel truly out of hand due to a struggling jungler with no path to recover. Even the fastest clearing junglers have little to no downtime between finishing one camp from the next. Our original intent for this aggressive respawn timing was that there’s always an opportunity cost to taking any other action on the map, and this pacing reduced jungler presence in lanes at the very early game. The problem it brings in hand is twofold: Junglers never feel like they’ve finished farming, almost like the game was telling them they were failing at optimizing their clears, and windows to set up exciting ganks were far few in between. As a result, we’re partially walking back camp timer respawns from last year’s preseason. In addition, we’re also matching camp indicators to how players intuitively play around them so that you aren’t constantly stressed about being everywhere at once. Setting a jungler behind is usually a concerted team effort of countering ganks, blocking off access to buffs, and controlling vision—not just the enemy jungler clearing faster or counter-jungling. This combined with the unforgiving pathing optimization due to aggressive 2:00 respawn timers leads to cases where junglers who fall behind, stay behind, and it’s far less likely they have the ability to stabilize in comparison to other roles. In lane, losing a turret means you’re farming closer to the safety of your base and enemies have to extend into your half of the map to fight you. But the jungle works counter to that, since a turret going down makes its neighboring section of the jungle drastically less safe for the rest of the game, since you have to extend past your inner turrets to farm it. All this being said, we don’t expect most players to run into this comeback experience, except in the most dire of circumstances. And ultimately, although this catchup boost is a helping hand, it won’t make struggling junglers as strong as they would have been, had they never fallen behind. A jungler’s nothing without his Summoner Spell, so we’re slapping on some quality of life buffs to Smite. No longer do you have to check your Smite tooltip or buff bar when approaching an epic monster, and now you should be more equipped to secure objectives. Putting Omnivamp on jungle items in preseason improved clarity by eliminating a wordy jungle-specific regen mechanic. But it also skewed towards benefiting champions who could clear fast (i.e. take less damage) and use the bonus as a health battery as the game went on. We’re pulling power out of Omnivamp while increasing the flat restore you get from Smite, and reducing jungle camp damage across the board, especially small AoE camps. This way, junglers are less punished when they aren’t able to instantly clear them. And to top it all off, we adjusted specific jungle camps based on our overarching goals: 1. Reduce incoming damage from jungle camps to offset the reduced healing from omnivamp, 2. change jungle monsters' health to offset the higher Smite damage, and 3. change gold values to offset income lost by spawn timers. We‘re back at it again with another set of VFX updates, this time for everyone's favorite void pupper, Kog'Maw! Once again, our goals for these sorts of smaller updates is to improve the overall gameplay clarity of VFX (here’s a whole article about it) while bringing them up to modern League of Legends standards. This means that our efforts are primarily aimed at abilities which do not clearly communicate their hitbox."
11.11,2021-05-25,"Hello! In this one, we’re looking back at changes we made earlier in the season and seeing how the dust settled. This includes curbing Jungle Morgana, whose buff from last patch worked too well and skewed her away from her primary roles. We also threw some love to Ryze, who’s been blue since the item shakeup (although he’s just blue overall). Then, we adjusted two champions who are commonly found with two items, namely Senna with Frostfire Gauntlet, and Master Yi with Duskblade. We don’t want a champ to feel bound to a certain item or to incentivize gameplay that feels out of character, so these changes should shuffle up more Mythic options for them while also sharpening their identities and playstyles. To top it all off, Nexus Blitz is back and better than ever, with its own slew of balance changes. And that's all, my friend! See ya in the next one. Take this portal to the TFT patch notes where your main never gets banned! Azir was soaring too high in Pro play, so we lowered his altitude with the 11.5 nerf. Now that he’s in calmer skies, we’re making his laning phase feel a bit more forgiving. Elise has had no trouble catching prey across all levels of play for a while now. With patch 11.10’s jungle changes, she’s crawled up and over the line. We’re reinforcing her identity as an early game jungler by curbing her damage in later stages of the game. Ezreal is struggling across all levels of play, so we’re giving him a small pick-me-up. Graves is having a tough time farming in the new jungle, so we’re bolstering up his holster. We’re not trying to beat a dead horse, but with our last round of nerfs in 11.9 and the jungle changes, we kind of did. Before, Hecarim was overwhelmingly beefy and speedy, allowing him to charge down enemies unscathed. Now that his beef and speed are in a more reasonable place, we’re upping Hecarim’s damage to keep him feeling happy and hefty when he chooses a fighter items. Lee’s buff in patch 11.8 shot him higher than anticipated in every role (jungle, top, and mid), so we’re partially pulling it back. Equipped with sword, shield, and sun, the Radiant Dawn has been burning too bright. We’re reeling in her damage to give her enemies some shade. Yi’s Mythic of choice is often Duskblade, which gears his playstyle to focus on Q damage and resets. Although Duskblade makes sense in certain situations, it can lead to low-counterplay gameplay that orients him away from what he does best—slicing down foes with basic attacks—so we’re shifting power around to buff those builds. Our buffs to jungle Morg in 11.8 were intended to shine a spotlight on her ability to jungle. Instead, it propelled Morgana to be more successful in the jungle than in her primary roles, so we’re adjusting accordingly. Many moons ago, Nautilus was a viable jungler. We're hooking him back on deck with buffs that speed up his AoE camp clear. Qiyana boasts a lot of things, and one of them is her early roaming potential. This has caused her to have an oppressive presence in Elite play for a while now, so we’re looking to take her down from her perch by tapping the brakes. There's been a-rumbling and a-grumbling in the jungle that a yordle has been a-blazing through Gromps and Bramblebacks galore. To cool his jets, we’re toning down his single-target damage to monsters. With the preseason item changes (aka losing Rod of Ages and Seraph’s Embrace’s shield) and patch 11.10’s nerf to Phase Rush, Ryze lost movement speed and health, leaving him feeling blue. We’re padding up his defenses to put some color back in his cheeks. Frostfire Gauntlet has become Senna’s dominant support build, boosting both her win and play rate. While tank Senna can be fun, it currently overshadows other item options and writes off her primary weakness as a squishy carry. To mitigate, we’re bringing more power back to support builds where she’s historically had success (lethality and AP), and tapping down Frostfire. We’re also taking this opportunity to slow down some of her range growth, which has been scaling a lot faster with the buff to her Mist in 11.2. Altogether, these changes should empower Senna to build items that better fit her identity as a powerful glass cannon. We're buffing mid lane Seraphine's performance by making her shielding per level more powerful, especially at higher levels. This should continue empowering Seraphine as a solo star. AD Shaco’s in a good spot, but his AP jungle and support builds are significantly stronger and need to be cranked back a bit. Even with the buff to Riftmaker in patch 11.10—Singed’s poison of choice—he’s still been underperforming across the board. We’re giving his Fling some cooldown scaling to give him more options in fights late game. Teemo’s W is often overlooked. We’re reducing its cooldown so that he can more readily use the spell’s active and wield his power as a mobile mushroom monster. Urgot’s been drilling through entire enemy teams in Average levels of play. We’re targeting his sustained damage after laning phase so he’s slightly less effective at purging his foes. We want players to feel empowered to make meaningful item choices each game. Right now, there are two trends that are limiting early game decision-making for tanks in top lane: purchasing Thornmail as a second item, and purchasing Bramble Vest without completing Thornmail. This routine highlights the problem of Bramble Vest and Thornmail being used as generalist items, rather than their intended purpose of being picked up to face high-healing enemies. These changes are intended to give these items more clearly defined roles in the power they provide for top lane tanks. One more thing: You may notice that we gave Frozen Heart a less generic stat line than other tank items. This is intentional, since it has other unique outputs. We’re also giving it a larger base value on Rock Solid than other items since it has less innate max health scaling. Altogether, it remains a source of high ability haste and mana, and is now clearly an anti-attacker item. The Moonstone buff in patch 11.9 was not enough. We’re increasing its healing and shielding power which should boost its strength for all Enchanters. Even with our changes to Black Cleaver’s functionality in patch 11.5, it hasn’t been a popular pick this season. We’re sharpening one of its unique points to better compete with its alternatives. Sunderer has been feeling more mediocre than divine. Fighters are finding more success with Trinity Force and tank Mythics, so we’re giving Sunderer a much needed bump up. As mentioned above, we’re tapping down Senna’s favorite Mythic. Ranged users can more easily and repeatedly land Frostfire’s slow, so we’re bringing down its power for them slightly. Staff of Flowing Water’s 11.8 nerf left it in a weak state in comparison to its competitors, and it could use some oomph. We’re putting power into its shared AP buff to ensure that it’s succeeding in situations where it’s the right item for the job (you know, when you actually have a strong AP teammate to buff). While Serpent's Fang's primary users are physical assassins, its power for ranged users feels underwhelming. We're reducing the gap between melee and ranged shield reduction to make it an option for countering high-shield enemies, even without assassins on your side. We’re reshaping the Wardstone line to fit more as a capstone support item, similar to Rabadon's Deathcap, Infinity Edge, and Gargoyle Stoneplate (all of which are stronger after you pick up a few other items). We’re also streamlining the purchase path to be a one-stop-shop like Manamune and Archangel's Staff, instead of having to repeatedly upgrade it. Hail of Blades has risen in prominence among marksmen, providing quick trades with a high uptime compared to other runes. We’re sharpening its intended weakness as a front-loaded skirmish tool by increasing its cooldown. Biscuit Delivery has become a staple in Pro play, both in lane and in the jungle. These tasty snacks were intended to aid lane sustain, rather than being sold back to the shop for a pretty penny. Putting those unused biscuits on discount. Nexus Blitz returns for the PROJECT event and will be available from May 27 to June 28."
11.12,2021-06-08,"We’ve got a light patch, focusing on champ adjustments this go-round (11.13’s going to have a big chunk of systems work). This means some love for Aphelios and some of his unpopular weapon combinations, and nerfs to Pro outliers (Renekton, Kai’Sa). Then the spotlight’s on everyone’s favorite, definitely trustworthy, definitely purple doctor. His appearance may seem revived, but we’re not too sure if the same can be expected of his patients. If Mundo doesn’t get you, then we’ll see ya in the next one! Take this portal to the TFT patch notes where Choncc's already partying in the pool. ""Cure"" every patient and go where you please with the updated Dr. Mundo! Dr. Mundo's legacy skins will be available for purchase in the store during patches 11.12 and 11.13. Aphelios’ changelist is a whole lot of numbers, so we’ll try and break it down. First and foremost: yes, it’s an Aphelios buff! He’s been in a slump in terms of win rate and Pro presence, and could use a helping hand to get back on his feet. To do this, we’re buffing his base stats and weapon combinations that have fallen out of favor, while pulling power from the combos that have emerged as clear favorites. By upping the reward he gets from using Infernum and Severum as off-hand weapons, he should feel more well-rounded and prepared to take down his enemies, no matter what’s in his immediate arsenal. With less early game AD from his core build than in previous seasons, Draven’s been less able to… well, Draven. Sharpening up his blades so he can keep up with his adoring fans. Baby beast is still throwing temper tantrums, and his threat and harass potential can be too much to handle. We’re pulling back some of his early lane power to give his enemies a chance to catch their breath (and maybe even Gnar’s boomerang). We weren’t kidding—Hecarim needed help last patch, and he still does now. We’re doubling down on the buff to his Q and reverting part of his 11.9 nerf. Time to run free, horsey. With a smaller mana pool than other fighters, Illaoi often runs low on mana in later phases of the game. This leaves her between a rock and a hard place, where she has to carefully balance when to use mana to push faster and when she’s ready to take on challengers. To solve this, we’re increasing her mana scaling. Jarvan tends to lose steam early on in a fight, so we’re giving him more incentives to stay in the battle and continue protecting the faithful. This fearless predator has been making Pro play her prey. We’re looking to draw back some of her early game power by curbing her ability to control waves and giving her opponents more opportunities to punish her when her Q is down. Malphite’s been feeling more rock-soft than solid. Combined with Bramble Vest’s nerf in patch 11.11, he’s hit rock bottom. To buff up his trading in lane, we’re amping up the thunder in his claps so that he can hit like the ton of bricks he is. Everyone knows Rammus and Bramble Vest are best friends, so it should come as no surprise that he’s been feeling prickly after Bramble’s 11.11 nerf. To mend fences, we’re putting more armor in the armordillo and letting him slam down more often, so that he can continue running rings around his competition. With the patch 11.11 buff to Divine Sunderer, Nasus has been a top dog (literally) in Average play, where he’s able to stay in lane and farm until the cows come home. We’re targeting this by reducing the amount of life steal he can get when he has easier access to minions. This croc has been up and down the block in Pro play. With resourceless sustain and waveclear, he’s able to wade into lane and neutralize most matchups, then force fights by jumping on a victim with his point-and-click CC. To address this, we’re scaling back his healing. Since our 11.10 nerfs, Talon’s settled in well—he’s about as strong as before in Elite play. We’re giving him another tap down by shifting power away from the initial part of his W and slightly lowering its overall scaling. To balance also giving a small boost to the second half of Rake, which is easier to dodge. Tank Phoenix Udyr has been rampaging across Pro play. We’re pecking down the damage he gets from tank builds, but compensating for when he wants to go AP bird instead. Varus’ buff in patch 11.4 on his W made his Lethality builds especially powerful, so we’re pulling back accordingly. Before the buffs to Divine Sunderer and Black Cleaver in patch 11.11, Wukong was already performing well. We knew the boost to his core items could tip him over the edge, but we weren’t sure exactly where he’d land—and now that we do, we’re hoping to directly offset the power that he gained. Ziggs hasn’t been around much lately, so we’re tossing him a bomb bone by strengthening his Q to spike harder in mid game. More importantly, we’re giving his ult a significant speed buff. This should make it more reliable when casting from long ranges while strengthening his powerful AoE damage in teamfights."
11.13,2021-06-22,"Oh, hello. Fancy seeing you here in these parts! Things have been cooking away for a while, and we’re finally able to serve you a whole feast in 11.13. This is largely a systems-based patch, where most of our work went into reducing mobility. In short, we’re pulling back on places where mobility has crept up, including a few items that have gone beyond the limits of where they should be. We're also looking to enhance the split push strategy and improve its gameplay to add variety and excitement to the overall end game. Speaking of eating, this patch also has a mini-reworked Tahm Kench! He’s got a fresh kit, VFX, and licks. So gobble away, friends. We’ll see ya in the next one. Take this portal to the TFT patch notes where we’re PROJECTed to deliver TFT champion reworks, balance changes, and more! Our 11.12 buffs to Aphelios steered him in the right direction, but cost him more power in Elite play than we’d hoped, leaving him weaker overall. This means he could use another push forward, so we’re adding some oomph to benefit all players across skill levels by boosting his less popular rankups. We’re addressing a unique, frustrating case where Kayn's VFX is hidden while in terrain. Hiding VFX while out of vision is standard for many abilities, but since it's impossible for players to gain vision within terrain, it's fair to give players the opportunity to react to Kayn's spells. He’s also uniquely able to exist within terrain for an extended period of time, which is why we’re implementing this rule on him specifically. Lee Sin has been dominating mid and top lane in all levels of play, especially at the highest tiers. We’re tempering down the max power of one of his more reliable in-lane abilities so that we’re not blindsiding him in the jungle. For an unstoppable Viking of destruction, Olaf has been pretty stalled in recent patches. We’re giving him more durability throughout the game and rounding up some numbers! Riven’s a champion who can block, dock, and knock up enemies at will, leaving enemies both wounded in their health bars and egos. This means she is especially strong in Skilled and Elite play, where on-demand shields are more readily used and capitalized on. By lowering some of her ability to mitigate damage, she’ll need to be more careful before dashing into her next battle. Despite his constant visits to the patch notes this season, Rumble’s still hot on his enemies’ tracks in both the mid lane and jungle. We’re cooling down his early clear speed and slowing down his roaming and ganking power. The Kench is shinier and slimier than ever with a pretty big update this patch! Historically, our favorite catfish has been limited by his power because his kit is so strong in professional play, forcing him to remain weak for the vast majority of players. To resolve this, we’re making a few major adjustments, so buckle up. First, we’re moving power from Devour—which is heavily used in coordinated play to completely negate allies’ weaknesses and enemies’ actions—into other abilities that reward him for proactive play. Previously, Tahm’s main contributions revolved around standing by to unconditionally save an ally with Devour. With this rework, he will need to take greater risks with his new Abyssal Dive and capitalize on licks and cool tricks (tongue healing, anyone?). Second, we’re making Devour easier to use with allies. They will now see a clear indicator when Devour is available so they know when to run to him for safety. Third, we’re adjusting Abyssal Voyage from being entirely about coordinating with an ally for a cross-map play (a strength heavily restricted to Pro play environments) into being an ability that works on its own. Last but not least, he’s getting new VFX so that the Kench can get a lick leg up on his competition, in style. With his ability to reliably replenish his health from waves, Viego’s been sitting a bit too comfortably in the mid lane. We’re shifting some power out of this sustain into a place all his roles can appreciate. Xayah has been feeling weak in all levels of play, so we’re fluffing her feathers by giving a good-sized buff to her Q, which tends to be maxed later in the game. Our intention is to buff her in a way that benefits all Xayahs, regardless of which ability you choose to max first, while also helping those who decide to max Q first stay more competitive. Are you a tank? Is there an annoying enemy on the other team? Boy, do we have an item for you! With Anathema’s Chains, you can select one unlucky foe to be easier prey. Vengeance can be yours, today! On a more serious note, this item gives tanks a unique defensive advantage when sparring against a single target, while also providing offensive CC. This should be especially useful when you’re in a game where you keep encountering the same enemy (or someone you just don’t like). Many fighters struggle to convert leads into wins right now, especially through split pushing. Hullbreaker's goal is to give them a strategic purchase where they can opt into a heavy and powerful split pushing strategy at the cost of being isolated from their team. This item should allow for the split pusher to take down towers and whoever comes to stop them. It also gives them a way to push through tanks and towers, similar to how the old Banner of Command worked, except now they have to stick with the minion to continue barreling down the lane. As mentioned back in May, we're doing an overall pass at movement speed within items and runes. We've adjusted items that have either passively crept up in movement speed (Lich Bane and Trinity Force) or have effects that weaken player expectations of what’s considered a safe range or escape route (Shurelya's and Nimbus Cloak). Most of these changes are expected to be power neutral, but we also threw in tweaks based on whether the item was over- or underperforming. A special note for Stridebreaker… While Stridebreaker's active is an exciting output for many fighters, it heavily weakened the Juggernaut class's primary weakness: mobility. Juggernauts excel once they begin combat on their terms, so an item that allows a Juggernaut to close gaps makes it inherently very powerful, not to mention its damage and ability to be reused. To address this, we’re altering its active to better suit Juggernauts’ needs and boosting it’s stats to amp up their strengths, rather than covering up their weaknesses. While there are a few strong mages, the class as a whole is weaker than in previous seasons. To remedy this, we’re putting some of their Mythics on the clearance rack to help them reach their first power spike earlier. This won’t solve all their problems, but should be an appreciable boost up. We’ll be keeping a close eye on where these changes land to see if they’re too much, not enough, or just right. Our patch 11.8 adjustments to Moonstone Renewer and Shurelya's Reverie were successful in opening up Mythic item options for Enchanters, but left Moonstone on the weaker side in comparison to Shurelya’s. We're repeating its buff from 11.11 on a smaller scale to nudge Moonstone up to par with Shurelya's, which is also receiving a movement speed nerf this patch. Divine Sunderer's been overperforming on a number of ranged champs (not just Ezreal, but definitely Ezreal). Before its 11.11 buffs, it was already very strong for these folks, but was an unpopular purchase. Now that it’s on the radar, we’re pulling back on its power pre-11.11 and a little more. As part of the mobility changes above, we’re pulling back on Nimbus Cloak’s bonus movement speed as the game progresses. Ghost Poro is very, very rarely taken in the Domination Tree's Tracking slot. We’re buffing up this poro to better reward playing the vision game. In recent seasons, top and bot inner towers haven't been a strategic objective due to their lack of value (literally) in comparison to other objectives on the map. To tackle this, we’re making these turret takedowns more rewarding, so that players are encouraged to look for leads in the side lanes and split pushing remains a viable, exciting strategy across all levels of play. This advantage should also help the split pusher feel like they have more agency to snowball into a big ol’ threat that can’t be ignored. Challenging and Chilling Smite give junglers early access to true damage against minions, which is especially punishing to early ranks of ultimate-summoned pets like Tibbers, H-28Q Apex Turret, Daisy, and the Maiden of the Mist. We're adding a damage modifier to Challenging and Chilling Smite so that smiting pets can still remain as a strategic choice for junglers throughout the game, but they aren’t able to completely obliterate low-rank ultimate pets as soon as Smite upgrades. And a reminder: minions includes pets, but doesn’t include monsters—so monster damage numbers remain unchanged here."
11.14,2021-07-07,"Oh. Hello. This patch, we’re flipping over to focusing on champions. Past the usual balancing, we’ve given adjustments to four friends: a follow-up buff to a catfish, a sweeping pass to solve some persistent issues with a dancer, a helping hand for a purple doctor in the jungle, and a boost to a fawn's solo combat. Then, we're also bringing down the power in Stridebreaker's slow, and giving some love to its favorite buyers (Darius and Garen) to compensate. And with Sentinels of Light comes a new event game mode, Ultimate Spellbook! Channel your inner Sylas and be prepared for an ult-erly good time. We’ll see ya in the next one. Take this portal to the TFT patch notes to check out the last patch before our Mid-Set, Reckoning: Dawn of Heroes! The last set of changes in patch 11.6 brought Akali back in line in Average and Elite levels of play, but she’s still a force to be reckoned with in the Pro scene. With this change, she’ll be slowed down before her full burst of damage, giving enemies a chance to strike back. With the removal of Stridebreaker's dash in 11.13, Darius could use some help getting his enemies in position for that sweet, sweet dunk. Reverting his nerf in patch 11.2, which was a direct result of his access to a dash. The good doctor has been going where he pleases in top lane, but has been significantly behind in the jungle. In order to keep both roles at a similar level, we’re giving him several buffs that should help start the meatball rolling in the jungle, while also tapping down his laning power and sustain. These changes should also set him up for our next patch, where we plan to further doctor him up for all roles and skill levels. To adjust for changes to Garen’s most loved items this patch (Stridebreaker and Dead Man’s Plate), we’re bumping up his movement speed. We’re also adding extra oomph to his ult so that even if he can’t get to squishier targets, his ult will be more powerful against tankier frontlines. Buffing up Graves the only way we know how (and also, he’s been really struggling in the current meta). With long cast times and highly-predictable plans of attack, Illaoi can’t really adapt on the fly. While immobility is an important weakness for juggernauts, this has significantly gated her performance in higher skill tiers, making her more pub stompy than is long-term healthy. With more movement speed, she’ll be more able to dodge skillshots, close gaps, and be in the right place at the right time. Overall, this should help her feel more adaptable while also leaving her in a better position for future tuning. We’ve got a set of changes for Irelia, who’s been dealing with some long standing issues. The gist: We’re smoothing out her power curve, toning down her dominance in Pro play by giving her enemies more opportunities for counterplay, and polishing up her kit to make it feel better to play overall. For more insight, we get into it in this Quick Gameplay Thoughts article! With patch 11.13’s nerf to Shurelya’s Battlesong and the popularity of a certain snake's tooth, Ivern has felt weaker in the jungle. We’re returning the shield power that he lost in 11.3 so that he can protect his friends (and the forest) a little better. Karma has risen in the ranks of Pro play as a safe top or mid pick that scales well with other carries. We’re drawing back her solo lane power by lowering her ability to consistently harass and push waves against short-ranged enemies. You know there’s a lot coming up when the summary line is a paragraph, so here’s the TL;DR—we’re buffing Lillia so that she’s less bashful when bonking down enemies in solo combat. How? We’re shifting some of her power out of her fast clear and coordination-dependent CC, which are often leveraged in higher levels of play into duel-focused strengths. This means that we’re bringing down her early game clear and movement speed, but helping her quickly recoup the losses once she gets her hooves on some AP and reaches mid-to-late game. With the addition of innate sustain, she’ll be able to stay healthy in extended fights and when she isn’t able to perfectly clear camps. Malzahar was one of the few mages that was already strong before the buffs to mana Mythics last patch. Now that we know exactly where he’s landed, we know just how much to reel him back in. We're lowering the scaling on Malzahar’s Q so that his power continues to come from his most unique and character-defining abilities. Nocturne has been a consistent force to be reckoned with, but the Stridebreaker reshape kicked him into overdrive. We're nerfing Stridebreaker this patch, but we don't expect that to fully knock him down from his pedestal, particularly in lane. One of Nocturne’s key strengths is his ability to sit in lane and sustain off of waves, shrugging off most harass that comes his way. Similar to the reasoning behind Viego’s nerf last patch, Nocturne is relying on an unhealthy pattern of resourceless sustain. He should be earning his keep instead of relying on his passive, and opponents should feel like they can make a dent in his shadows. The nerf to Prowler’s Claw in patch 11.13 left Rek’Sai very sad. We’re giving her some direct compensation with a touch of mid-game burst. The Songstress has been feeling out of tune in both support and mid, so we’re helping her practice her scales (damage scaling, you know?) on one of her more aggressive abilities. Whether AD or AP, Jungle Shaco is simply very strong. We’re targeting both builds by making him a little more squishy and a little less slippery, given his many tools of elusion and mayhem. One of our goals with Tahm Kench’s mini-rework in 11.13 was to get him off the ""he can't be buffed because of Pro play"" bench, and to help him find more success as a support. As of right now, we suspect he’s weaker than where he should be, so we’re cautiously buffing him until we have conclusive results from Pro play. Another goal was to push the Kench more towards support, whereas before he was mostly seen in the jungle or top lane in solo queue. He’s not seeing as much support play as we expected, so we’re adjusting his scaling to be less gold and experience dependent. Taric has been in a constant struggle with mana dependence this season, so we’re directly dropping his costs so he can sparkle like the enchanting jewel he is. Xin Zhao is at the top of his game and the jungle roster, especially with recent nerfs to his competitors (Rumble and Udyr). To knock him down a peg, we’re reducing how often he’s able to threaten enemies at a distance. Bot Ziggs has been toeing the line for a while now, and with his 11.12 buffs, 11.13 mage item buffs, and his unending supply of bombs (where does he even pull them out from?), he’s finally crossed it. Although his buff in 11.12 lent a hand to this, we believe those changes were important to help Ziggs’ abilities deliver on their gameplay promise, so we’re opting for a nerf that should hit his bot lane early game the hardest. Dead Man's Plate’s changes from last patch led to a win rate drop for tanks since it lost movement speed and gained damage-scaling. To offset, we’re upping its armor to give tanks more tank to tank. Stridebreaker landed strong after its change last patch. One of our goals for the item was to give fighters a way to stick to a target for a period of time, but they don’t need to bring their unlucky foe to a complete standstill to do that. So we’re toning down how much it can slow, but keeping its slow over time. Also, we did an oopsie—the changes also caused Stridebreaker to lose 5 AD on completion. That’s fixed now. Sentinels of Light brings a new event game mode, Ultimate Spellbook! In this mode, you'll pick a different champion's ultimate to use instead of a second Summoner Spell to pull off the wombo combo of your dreams! We're making an under-the-hood change to move League's penalties onto our Riot-wide system. The only immediate impact is a change to how chat restrictions work, since the Riot-wide system uses time-based restrictions."
11.15,2021-07-21,"Saddle up Sentinels, welcome to 11.15! Nothing too wild here— we’re continuing to drop early sustain in a few places, then buffing up champions in places that are a little spicy and a lot fun (Blitz! Kennen! Xayah!). We’ve also got balance changes and updates for Ultimate Spellbook, including the addition of a certain rock’s ult. Add in a Sentinel with a glorious smile and a chain warden’s skin (literally) and you’ve got the gist of it! We’ll see ya in the next one. Take this portal to the TFT patch notes where Dawn of Heroes, our mid-set full of Sentinels has begun! We've heard your feedback on the slow progression rate in the Rise of the Sentinels in-client narrative experience. Starting with the next chapter of Rise of the Sentinels, we're adding a new, infinitely repeatable mission that awards extra Sentinels points just for playing a game. Including base TFT. Note: Since we're doing this mid-event, the missions are hidden, but the faster rate of progress should be immediately noticeable. Akshan swings into battle against Ruination on July 22nd! The small pyromaniac and her bear are taking over Skilled play! Annie does well versus short-range characters, which are her more common match-ups, so we’re lowering her upfront burst damage and lane harass. Aurelion Sol is toeing the line in Elite play, and he’s finally put his claw right over it. Slowing him down accordingly. Blitz has been cranking out pretty low lethality in the early/mid game. Considering he’s got a flashy fist, it should feel more rewarding when it actually hits. To polish him off, we’re also giving him a thicker metal skin. The Sheriff of Piltover could use some encouragement getting on over to the current marksman meta. She’s been finding success with Q-max builds, so we’re adding more incentive by boosting its scaling. Cassiopeia used to be a lane bully, but over the years, her gameplay has become farming patiently through the early game until she scales up to a point where she’s able to dish out the damage. With this change, she’ll be more able to press an advantage when she lands her Q in the early laning phase. Equipped with raw stat power and a big ol’ pair of scissors, it’s a little too easy for Gwen to snip back at even the toughest of opponents. We’re looking to sharpen her intended weakness by tapping down the speed of her slashes from level 1. After a good visit in 11.14’s patch notes, Irelia’s ended up on the strong side but in a much better position to balance moving forward. We’ll be watching to see where she lands longterm, but for now, we’re limiting the power on her W. In mid lane, Kayle’s a safe pick who can reliably stand fly her ground until she hits her power spike. Reducing her magic resist from the get-go should give opponents more opportunities to punish her vulnerable early game. Struggling across the board, Kennen’s been out of sight for a while now. We’re upping his main ability to feel more like a strike from a storm rather than a sting. The Iron Revenant’s been having trouble standing up to the current fighters in top lane, so we’re passing him more durability to help him hold his own in lane and overall throughout the game. Nidalee is known for being fierce, but as of late, her performance across all levels of play has been anything but. With more health, she should be less afraid to bring out the cougar against her prey, and should also help her feel more accessible to players who are just picking her up. Rell is a champion who brings disruption and fury to her foes, especially when she’s able to pull out her full combo in extended fights, but she’s been weak across all levels of play. We’re reverting her 11.5 nerf so that she’ll be able to crash down on her opponents, tough out the fight, and mount up—and be able to do it all over again. We’re addressing some frustrating bugs around Rumble’s Overheated system that were left from our changes in patch 11.13. These fixes should even out some abnormalities and help players feel more in control of Tristy. Shyvana could use more oomph in her one point wonder, so we're buffing her Q to help her clear speeds and let her really dig her teeth into her enemies. We're also adding in some AP compensation so that both her builds can benefit equally. Sylas is a versatile dueler who does what he does a little too well—healing his way through fights, often swinging the battle to his advantage, often catching his opponents off guard. Although sustain is an important part of his kit, enemies should be able to find some kink in his armor. We’re moving some of his sustain power over to his chains so that he doesn’t swing fights as hard, but can still find success when he lands his less-reliable abilities. Syndra’s 10.13 mana nerf was intended to bring her down in Pro play, but it was only somewhat effective, while also causing painful detriment to her early game. Now that she’s much less present in Pro, we’re reverting the change and will find another tactic if she poses a problem in the future. With all his tools to keep his friends alive, Thresh is one of the best at peeling enemies off of otherwise vulnerable allies. Recently, he’s been dominating Pro play, so we’re curbing his power by targeting his E’s uptime. Despite his last visit to the patch notes in 11.13, Viego’s continued to be a popular pick in all his roles. We’re taking another pass by targeting his solo lane power and compensating with additional monster damage in the hopes he’ll end up in a more balanced state long-term . Wukong’s able to stay healthy in lane, even after taking a beating. We’re lowering his sustain so that while he remains a strong duelist, he’ll need more time to lick his wounds. Xayah’s been dragging behind the rest of the flock. Some spice should really let her feathers fly. Hullbreaker could use some help as the game reaches later phases of the game. We’re giving more durability for anyone who’s hunting alone. And into the third split of Ranked we go on Sunday, August 8 at 11:59 PM local time for your region! Bop your way to the top with exclusive rewards: an Akshan summoner icon, Akshan emotes, and a Series 1 Eternals Capsule."
11.16,2021-08-10,"Ah! You’re here, we’re back, and it’s time to crack open 11.16! In this patch, we’re helping out some sad friends: a boy and his yeti’s packing more in their snowballs, Sivir’s sharpening up her bouncing blades, and Jarvan’s really going to show that terrain who’s boss. We’re also targeting other friends who have been popping up on the balance radar, like a short yordle with a short fuse, and a monk with a big kick. We’re also making a sweep of adjustments to a soul of enlightenment and a babe who can strike a chord with just about anyone. Add in some item changes and new features in Ranked (ever wanted solid proof that you're better than your friends?), and that’s about it. As always, we’ll see ya in the next one. For those who fear all things wicked and wicken, take this portal to the TFT patch notes where monsters and witches alike were vanquished in the Dawn of Heroes! Since our 11.8 changes, Diana’s become a popular jungle pick, and a powerful one at that, especially in competitive play. Although we’re happy that Diana’s found a second home, she’s a little too strong. To nudge down her jungle strength, we’re nerfing her jungle clear. Fiora's been on the strong side for a while, especially in higher levels of play. We're bringing down her split pushing and tower whacking power in mid to late phases of the game. The Exemplar of Demacia hasn’t been excelling in any level of play. We’re amping up Cataclysm to help him make a bigger impact while also buffing his dueling and clearing potential. Jhin has been feeling rather lackluster, and he hasn’t been making the cut into most games. With a deadlier flourish and an even deadlier finale, he’ll have a better shot at picking off enemies when playing off of allies and in key fights. Karma’s been much stronger in coordinated Pro play than in solo queue for a while. Rather than continuing to make minor changes, we're attempting to make bigger ones to help Karma succeed in the hands of all players. To do so, we’re targeting her consistent early game pressure and waveclear, along with her R-E shield-and-speed buff for her full team. In return, we’re rewarding her with more Mantras when she lands abilities on champions, which will also be helped by her Q’s lower cooldown and cost. We’re also strengthening her R-Q so that she’s still able to obliterate her foes when she’s on her own. Lee Sin came out of our 11.13 nerfs kicking, making his way from dominating lanes straight into dominating the jungle. This time, we’re laying down a straightforward nerf that should curb his early- to mid-game dueling power. While Lulu’s power in Average play is balanced, she’s strong in Skilled and even stronger in Elite. Back in patch 11.9, we purposefully buffed Lulu, targeting these skill brackets by reducing the cooldown on her W and increasing its bonus attack speed. The increased uptime on reliable peel made her a highly frustrating champion to play against, which has been reflected in her high ban rates. To get her back in action, we’re reverting the buff on her Skilled-skewed mechanic of instant CC and increasing her R cooldown. Top Maokai has been struggling to stay in lane even with his tank builds, so we’re increasing his sustain. On the other hand, Support Mao and his saplings have been causing a commotion in the bot lane, where AP builds offer powerful scaling. Maokai will still have strong poke, but we’re toning it down. One more thing: Maokai's original passive values were bugged. He was healing for less of his maximum health (5-13% instead of 6-13%) and it wasn’t scaling properly (it was scaling linearly at every level instead of its intended breakpoints of level 1/6/9…). so the previous values of his passive’s heal reflect the bugged, in-game values. Now, the scaling has been corrected, and the heal from his maximum health has an even bigger bump than his tooltip would have you believe. Nunu & Willump have hit a slump, it’s time to give them a good ol’ bump! To get the snowball rolling, we’re reverting part of their nerf from patch 11.2 while throwing them more damage when they’re building more aggressively. Okay, so last patch (11.15), we fixed a longstanding bug where Shaco’s smoke poof wasn’t showing up through the Fog of War. And by longstanding, we mean like, 2 years. This change also sparked a conversation around proper counterplay in League. Constantly panning around to look for orange smoke isn’t the type of gameplay we want to enforce, so we’re reverting the poof and fixing some of his goofs. Sivir’s a team-shredding, boomerang mercenary, but even her crit builds have left her feeling incomplete, so we’re sharpening up her blades. In patch 10.4, our baby girl was given a mana refund mechanic to prevent oppressive playstyles. This wasn’t a particularly fun mechanic, and sometimes it put Sona in situations where she was punished for using her spells correctly, like rotating around the map with E by herself. To fix this, we’re replacing the mechanic with a new one that should feel much more like a reward than a punishment. Now Sona has a stacking mechanic that rewards her for using some of her abilities, eventually giving her more access to her ult, and giving you all those Crescendo plays that you definitely never miss. Tahm Kench’s early game power has been especially strong in top lane, where he’s able to issue beatdowns and heal through brawls. We’re dialing both back to give his enemies more time to lick their wounds. Top Vlad has been dragging behind his mid lane counterpart. To help him hold his own in top lane, we’re increasing his passive bonuses, which should also let him reap the benefits of building tankier items. Even after our last set of nerfs in patch 11.14, Xin Zhao is still one of the top dogs in the jungle at all levels of play. With longer ranges on his new W and E, Xin doesn’t need to be one of the best-in-class early game bullies, since he has better access to his targets than ever before. We’re trimming his base damage so that he’s still strong early, but isn’t as easily able to overwhelm other junglers. Our 11.14 nerf to bot lane Ziggs seemed to fizzle out, so we’re giving back his mana and dialing back his second-max ability instead. This should curb his power more in bot lane, which shouldbe more easily recouped in mid. While Dark Seal is meant to be a high-risk, high-reward item, it's become a consistently high-value option for most AP users, even for champions that appreciate the mana on Doran's Ring. We’re pulling back on the stacking pace of the item so that there's more risk involved when opting into Dark Seal. Redemption is being overshadowed by the other Enchanter items and has struggled to find its niche this season. We’re increasing the power and availability of its exciting moments so that it can be more effective in more team fights. The second weekend of the Bandle City-themed Clash will be August 21 and 22. Team formation for the second weekend will be open starting on August 16."
11.17,2021-08-24,"It's a bird... it's a plane... it's patch 11.17! (And a new patch notes author, now that mom cat has left us for taller scratching posts!) In this episode of Crime City Nightmare, heroes and villains alike prepare to fight once again. The newest champion in town refines his toolkit, our favorite sad mummy finds some extra bandages, and Lucian fights vigilantly in bot lane with his trusty sidekicks. Fleet Footwork is also getting some tweaks to help you fight (or flee from) your foes! These'll be our last big(ish) updates for a while because, starting next patch, we’ll be extra careful about any changes with Worlds approaching soon. There's your mission debriefing for today, folks. Be careful out there—they say you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain. To be continued... If you're looking for a safe haven from Crime City, take this portal to the TFT patch notes where crimes only happen when you take my carousel item! We're updating the web browser at the heart of the League Client! This'll mean fewer crashes, lower memory consumption, and faster performance. It also unlocks our ability to make future improvements so there's plenty more to come. We're updating RP pricing for some regions for Teamfight Tactics and League of Legends on September 8. Brazil, Latin America, Russia, and Turkey will see increased prices due to exchange rates and tax changes. From August 23 to September 8, players will receive double Bonus Currency from all RP purchases. Check the link for specific numbers and times! Players are still figuring out Akshan, so we're being cautious with any changes to this charismatic rogue. We're also cleaning up some pesky bugs and making his E-max a little less overpowered. This'll make his AD builds more appealing while also making up for the damage loss in Q-max builds. Finally, the change to his W should give opponents a way to stop Akshan from reviving all his allies—in other words, kill him first! Our sad little mummy's been left out of high level play for ages. While there's an easy joke here about Amumu having no friends, we wanted to address this long-standing problem and ensure he can find his way in the world of modern League. In particular, we wanted to up his engage threat in the early game where high MMR players prioritize securing small leads that can snowball into victory. One subtle benefit of 2-charge Q, beyond the obvious stuff: It reduces the pressure to spam Q on cooldown, since you aren't ""wasting"" uptime by holding onto your first charge as long as the second is recharging. This creates a new avenue for skill expression: When should Amumu use both charges, and when should he hold one? All this said, Amumu's late game has never really been his problem. We tossed in a few nerfs to his later scaling to even out his newly-increased potential to get ahead early. From a raw stats perspective, he'll be innately weaker at higher levels, but now he'll get there faster and have more items when he does. As a reminder, W ticks twice per second, so each tick deals half the listed damage below! Ekko is played more in the jungle than in mid lane, yet jungle Ekko is languishing in terms of power. We're juicing up his jungle clear speed to help him shatter more camps in less... time. Eve's been left in the dark by recent nerfs to her early core items like Lich Bane and Dark Seal. We're lowering the cooldown on her ultimate early so our lovely demon lady can still find victims opportunities to create leads. Gangplank's interaction with Grasp of the Undying made his poke pattern of clicking Q every 4 seconds a nightmare for counterplay, which made his lane power pretty explosive. As a result, we've had to limit his scaling in a way that's been unsatisfying for Gangplank players, given that late game power has traditionally been core to his identity. We're walking back on that plank by lowering his early advantages and bringing them back ashore in late game with extra crit-skewed spice. More barrels! Graves has been cropping up as a dominant mid pick, so we're nerfing his ability to control lane priority with his wave-clearing Q in a way that still retains his jungle power. Irelia's blades are still a bit too deadly. We're tapping down her innate sustain so that she's a bit more punishable when she makes mistakes. This'll also nerf the Ionian blade dancer's ability to spin around seemingly-doomed teamfights at super low health. Blue Kayn's been overshadowing games too regularly, especially with his Goredrinker build. We're reducing assassin Kayn's damage to encourage him to build more offensively in order to reap his enemies. Leona's been shining a bit too bright with her ability to soak up any damage that comes her way when she's locking down opponents. We're making her a little easier to kill so that opponents still have the opportunity to fight back. SPF still recommended. Lissandra's been frozen at pretty mediocre numbers across the board, even into her favorable matchups. We're giving her some slight buffs to make the ice witch a more attractive pick. Lucian's been struggling quite literally everywhere except in Pro mid lane. We're purifying his odds by empowering his duo lane synergy without compromising his solo capabilities. For example, his ult's been super powerful in solo lanes due to its heavy level scaling, so we're smoothing it out to scale better with gold. AP Lucian is also getting some compensation buffs since we know it's a fun (although weak) build that gets affected by these AD-encouraging changes. Don't worry, we haven't forgotten about you, fans of the off-meta lulz. We haven't gotten to sea Nami much lately, so we're shifting the current by giving the tidecaller some blessings to improve her survivability in trades and allow her to use her costliest skill more. Senna's DPS focused builds have mist the mark recently. We're buffing up her crit to better synergize with damage items and giving her more souls on minion kills to help out players who run her as farming carry. Teemo could use a power-up in lane where we expect him to be able to whittle down his opponents, especially in favorable matchups when he can execute a series of Toxic Shots. Hut, two, three, four... :^) Viego's been breaking too many hearts in the pro scene, so we're bringing down the sovereign's domination a notch. His tanky builds are offering too much pop-off potential, so we're significantly cutting back the power of his resets if he's not building damage. We're also increasing his camouflage detection range and reducing his basic attack range which, combined, will make it much harder for Viego to hide in the Black Mist as a source of safety. Lastly, we're reducing the CC on his ult since that wasn't really its main intent. We're back with a third round of Xayah buffs! We've been steadily bringing up her winrate while trying not to increase her pick rate in Pro too much. The rebel hasn't taken off in Pro play yet, so we can still give her a bit more room to fly. Xayah's Q tends to interrupt her basic attack flow at higher attack speeds, so this should let her feathers glide more smoothly throughout the game. (For Q's scaling, remember Xayah gains 70% bonus AS from levels and 55% from W!) Once Zed gets some items under his belt, his kill pattern becomes too reliable, especially for a champion with such flexible mobility tools to slip in and out of the shadows. We're asking the master of shadows to master more shurikens to secure his kills. His ult cooldown is also getting nerfed late to match its power level more appropriately. Divine Sunderer has been the go-to choice for fighters all across the spectrum, and even some marksmen. We're looking to nerf its generic power to let its more aggressive item competitors outshine it when they're supposed to. While Hullbreaker is a strong early rush on a few champions, its opportunity cost is too large to be a great choice compared to other Legendary fighter items that have more generic value. We're giving it a bit of beef so that players feel a bit more inclined to go on a raiding party. Rather than being a situational item against shield-heavy enemies, Serpent's Fang has become a staple in the second item slot for physical assassins. We want to preserve its low gold cost so that it's still an accessible situational pickup, but with stats that are more proportional. Wit's End has become a powerful early rush item for a variety of attack speed champions. While it's good to offer early attack speed options, Wit's End often becomes the best choice regardless of how much magic damage the enemy team has. We're reshaping its damage scaling so that it's just as powerful late but isn't only being picked up for its early damage value. Youmuu's went from being a beloved aggressive pick to an underutilized niche item. We nerfed its generic power last season to give room for other situational items, but we're seeing now that we went a little too far. AD assassins have been yearning for a good general item rather than defaulting to counter pick-ups like Serpent's Fang. So, *drumroll please*... we're reverting the patch 10.23 changes and welcoming back 2020’s Youmuu's Ghostblade! Fleet Footwork just hasn't been a very good pick for marksmen. Rather than a straight buff to make it more viable, we're increasing healing against champions for everyone and reducing healing against minions depending on attack type to avoid too much power in lane sustain. Healing against minions for melee is getting reduced more than ranged because melee champions have already been using it very effectively for that very reason, making this an overall buff for ranged and closer to neutral for melee. The first weekend of the Void-themed Clash will be September 4 and 5. Team formation for the first weekend will open starting on August 30. The second weekend will be September 18 and 19, and team formation will open starting on September 13. Minimum system requirements for League of Legends and Teamfight Tactics on desktop are changing. In particular, Macs are now required to run macOS 10.12 or later. We update these requirements so that we can focus on delivering new features rather than maintaining older hardware. If your system meets or exceeds these specs, you're still good to go!"
11.18,2021-09-08,"𝔏𝔢𝔤𝔢𝔫𝔡𝔰 𝔥𝔞𝔳𝔢 𝔯𝔢𝔱𝔲𝔯𝔫𝔢𝔡. 𝔗𝔥𝔢 𝔣𝔦𝔫𝔞𝔩 𝔟𝔞𝔱𝔱𝔩𝔢 𝔩𝔬𝔬𝔪𝔰... Every year, we compose a set of nerfs and buffs to breathe new life into the Pro meta for Worlds. Doesn't it just set your heart aflame when you see your main champion on stage for the first time? Or when your favorite team melts their enemy's faces off with ungodly new builds? Since this is the first of two Worlds-focused patches, we're cranking up the dissonance—but with style, of course. The solo queue show must go on, so we've done our best not to corrupt regular gameplay. With that said, we're willing to revert any of these changes if they go too far, but we're hoping this bit of chaos will rock your world... s. After a full day of headbanging to Pentakill, come over and Penta-chill with this portal to the TFT patch notes! Aphelios' early game is very consistent right now, which explains his elevated presence in Pro play recently. We're nerfing his laning phase to make it harder for him to get to his first item and scale. Uh, something something moonstones. Ashe's lane control early game goes a bit too far and wide. We're giving her opponents more space to play back without getting pierced by cones and cones of crystalline arrows. Camille's steel-like resilience is a bit too high for her scaling power, so we're nerfing her shield early to make her more vulnerable in lane. We're giving the Glorious Executioner something he's wanted for a long time—an execute—but putting it on the ability in his kit with the most counterplay. Rather than just staying away from him the entire game, opponents will now be more incentivized to kill Draven than ever before. Let the games begin. While it's true that Grievous Wounds is the standard against healing champs, it's left Dr. Mundo rather sickly at higher levels of play. Anti-healing items tend to undermine champions like him and Soraka whose entire identities are designed around big beefy heals. The immediate base health gained from his ult will now ignore Grievous Wounds, but the healing over time will still be affected by it. This should make the anti-heal effect less sharp of a counter but still enough of a jab to hurt Mundo good. We're also juicing up his jungle potential to make him more appealing as a Pro flex pick. A lot of Fizz's power is in his ult, which is inconsistent in skilled play since more players at that level know to either dodge or Zhonya's it. His R will still pack a punch, but we're borrowing some of its bite and putting it into his early game threat with W as well as giving him a thicker skin against basic attacks to help his survivability in lane. Last patch, we changed Gangplank's Q so that it would count as a ranged instead of melee attack. He's lost a lot of durability now that he doesn't benefit as much from Grasp of the Undying (and thus the rest of the Resolve tree) anymore. Giving this pirate some of his burliness back to help him survive the choppy waters of early top lane. Jayce is an all-around power slam in highly skilled hands. Rather than reduce his wattage damage output, we're turning down his ability to outrun ganks and quickly traverse the map, both of which are particularly useful for the Pro scene. We're boosting Jinx's lane push power to make her a more viable pick and increase her early game overall. Katchoo! Kai'Sa represents a hypercarry style that we haven't seen much of in this meta's bully-focused bot lane. Since she's known for her scaling capability, we're buffing exactly that while keeping both her lane vulnerability and Q burst damage intact. Kalista's ult with a melee support is almost guaranteed to kill with chain CC, especially in Pro-level high coordination gank setups. We’re giving her opponents a slightly bigger window to escape her wrath. Karma's changes in 11.16 were effective at reducing her dominance in Pro play while avoiding major nerfs to her everywhere else. Since she's been on the weaker side overall, we're upping her winrate across the board with some generic buffs. She really does always catch up, huh? AD Kog is in a healthy spot now, but AP Kog has all but shriveled up. While our very hungry caterpillar should be weaker than other champions early in the game, he simply hasn't been a viable pick mid. We're buffing his waveclear to more reasonable levels to help him become the beautiful butterfly he really is. Despite all his previous nerfs, Lee Sin has still been a super duper high priority Pro pick in jungle. (The blind monk was so popular, he got either picked or banned in 100% of LCK games during patch 11.16!) Tapping him down yet again with an early game nerf to clear the jungle champ pool for Worlds. Lillia's been very strong in top lane, limiting our ability to buff her jungling capabilities. Her early sustain will now be fairly conditional on hitting jungle monsters, making her a riskier pick in aggressive lanes and freeing up room for us to help her prance, dance, and—oops!—trip in the jungle. Miss Fortune has unfortunately been missing out on wins at all levels of play. Giving her ult some more bang to spice up the wombo combos. We've got a good feeling about this. ;) Morgana has fallen as a support in both Average and Pro play. Giving her more access to her unique CC blocking shield should help, especially in matchups where she's historically excelled. (Looking at you, hard stun and knockup supports.) We removed Qiyana's ability to jungle back when she was a dominant mid/jungle flex pick in Pro. Her standings in mid have gone down since then, so we're cautiously optimistic about reintroducing her to the jungle. Our empress also has a staggeringly high-tier-biased winrate (sort of like Amumu, but the inverse). A likely reason for this skew is that her E+Q auto-aim combo can't be dodged at all, invalidating many would-be outplays which feels really bad. We're revising its targeting mechanisms to empower opponents who are quick enough to dare challenge her. Renekton continues to live up to his name in Pro play, butchering his foes left and right. We're nerfing his crowd control specifically by changing the way his W works when empowered by Passive - Reign of Anger. This'll make it notably harder for him to lock down targets throughout the game, both in lane ganks and teamfights. To explain that weird self-lockout note below: Previously, Renekton was able to bypass his empowered W's additional lockout by attacking or moving at just the right time. We're making this decreased lockout time the baseline so the croc isn't CCing himself for almost as long as his target. In 11.13, we simmered down Rumble's early game to temper his extreme jungle power in Pro play. This ended up being a huge damper to Rumble players all around, so we're rekindling his flame by buffing that back and nerfing his early jungle clear using a different approach. Now we're cookin'! As a damage-over-time champion in the top lane, Singed can struggle to make his damage stick against enemy healing. We're juicing up the mad chemist's signature concoction so he can counteract this when going for that kill with his ultimate... Slowly, but surely. Like Dr. Mundo, Soraka's been particularly pained by Grievous Wounds over the past few seasons. While anti-healing items should be a valid counter to Soraka's sustain, it's starting to severely impede on her core gameplay. We're making every Soraka player's wish come true by giving her a limited tool to respond and make those clutch heals, but only on her ult (which has a pretty long cooldown). Taliyah's found solid footing in the jungle but she's still on shaky ground in mid. Her kit has a number of rules that feel more punishing than empowering, so we're loosening up by reframing Worked Ground as an optional way to cast successive Qs rather than a severe movement tax on her higher-damage full Qs. We're attempting to introduce some new assassin-y options into the jungle meta. Talon's got a clear advantage here with his high-mobility E—hardcore parkour!—so increasing his clear speed should make him a reasonable option in the role. Talon mid is also getting a little too powerful, so we're dulling his blades in late game a smidge. Thresh has arguably been the best support champ in Pro meta for much of the year despite multiple nerfs. We're taking a larger swing here at his ability to nullify popular melee support engages (think Leona, Nautilus, Rell) as well as his offensive threat to those same laners. Since this is a pretty big nerf, we're compensating some of the lost early damage with better Soul scaling, which is usually lower priority in Pro. Trundle's become a potent jungle/support flex pick in professional play. We're tamping down the troll king's power in his secondary role a bit by nerfing his E, which supports typically max first and junglers usually max third. Many of Twitch's skirmishes in higher level play involve sneaking around and blasting his enemies with his ult. We're ripening the damage only on his R to make his best-case surprise engagements more powerful without overbuffing his jungle or non-ultimate DPS. Urgot is pretty solid, but he struggles against ranged champions that often dominate the Pro top lane meta. This is a light buff that'll help him handle those situations more reliably. Varus has been bullying his lanes pretty hard, especially in Pro play. These changes should weaken his early game a bit on all fronts. Despite his reasonable power level in Average play, Yone falls behind at higher skill bands. Rather than directly buffing his 1v1 or assassination potential, we're enhancing one of Yone's more skill-based outputs on W to improve his skirmishing and teamfighting when piloted well. Yuumi can make for a catty bot lane when chosen as a niche pick. We're encouraging her to play more aggressively early so that she can be more influential in lane. This'll also give enemies more opportunities to pet play with engage the kitty early on. These dynamic changes should be less frustrating for both Yuumi players and opponents alike, but if her claws get a bit too sharp, we'll look to trim the less interactive parts of her kit like her late-game scaling and sustain while keeping her early game power feisty. Zed's another assassin we're attempting to introduce into the jungle meta. Our buffs to Zed jungle earlier in the season didn't really land, so we're taking another stab at making him viable in the role by buffing his passive's damage vs monsters again. Zoe was putting way too many champions to sleep, so we increased her E cooldown back in 9.6. Now that she's no longer as much of a nightmare, we're reverting the nerf so she can contribute more throughout a fight. Prepare for trouble. And make it bubble. If an enemy champion stands next to the tower you're attacking, Ravenous Hydra's AoE passive triggers turret aggro, which is rather counterintuitive to split-pushing top laners who want to take down towers. Repeat the above except say ""Titanic"" instead of ""Ravenous"". We put a titanic amount of effort into writing this paragraph. Umbral Glaive's stats and cost were bumped up last preseason to match it more closely with other lethality-focused Legendary items. However, this left it at a pretty weak state while also pricing it out of budget for supports like Senna and Pyke. We're shrinking the cost yet again and (hopefully!) bringing lethality supports back into Pro play. Increasing Predator's ganking power to push it up to Pro viability for junglers who gotta go fast—like former users Skarner, Hecarim, and Lillia. Team formation for the second weekend of the Void-themed Clash will open starting on September 13 and the tournaments will be on September 18 and 19. We turned off the Web Match History site on September 7. The in-client version is still available! Check out our recent article for more info."
11.19,2021-09-21,"Worlds. Vex. URF. But wait... there's more! Can you believe we're just two weeks out from Worlds 2021?! In this patch, we've got the second and final round of Worlds-focused champion buffs and nerfs, plus new Dawnbringer/Nightbringer skins and Worlds 2021 Jarvan IV to celebrate. Worlds Clash is also getting into the Worlds spirit with some special Worlds-themed loot. (Oh, did I mention Worlds is coming up?) Vex is also begrudgingly making her way to the Rift this week. Don't get too excited, though—she hates that. For rotating game modes, URF returns for some more good ol' chaotic fun. We've also introduced changes to behavioral systems and a few tweaks to the client to improve your experience! It's going to be a battle of epic proportions. See ya on the livestream~ People banning the new champ got you vexed? Well then, come on down to the TFT patch notes where the only thing that gets banned is a bad time! Cast doom, gloom, and existential dread (or whatever) with Vex and her shadow on September 23! Aatrox's W cooldown was heavily nerfed in patch 9.9 in an effort to reduce his Pro domination. He's not running over the Pro scene anymore, so we're loosening his chains a bit. In a rare flip of events, Akali has room for some power at all levels of play. We're taking this opportunity to make her missteps a bit more forgiving in a way that doesn't win her more fights, but instead helps her subtly throughout her games. Despite being terrifyingly tanky, Cho'Gath is still weak across the board. We're increasing his CC and zoning capabilities so that he has more influence in fights. The 11.18 changes were an unintentional nerf to Fizz. We overestimated the Passive and W buffs and underestimated the R nerf. Rather than trying to fine tune those changes, we're reverting them entirely and doing a simpler buff instead. Go fish! Galio's nerf back in 11.10 turned out to be a bit too effective on his Elite performance. We're bringing him back to life at that skill level by partially reverting those changes. Gragas didn't benefit much from the Predator changes last patch, so he's still pretty weak. We're helping his various AP builds pack more of a punch and speed up his mid-game clear. However, please remember to always drink responsibly. Gwen's E nerf in 11.15 was effective in snipping her overwhelming early lane power, especially in Pro. Now, similar to Akali's situation, there's room to weave in some more durability for Gwen players at all levels. Kennen's been on a dramatic rise in Pro priority since our changes in 11.15. We’re reducing his power by walking back on those changes slightly. Mordekaiser's bummed that he’s been falling behind his peers. We don’t want the god of metal to be the butt of jokes, so we’re buffing him for skilled players by granting him more access to his most flexible spell. Poppy hasn't been looking too heroic lately, especially in top lane. We're enhancing her early lane power so that she can take greater advantage of favorable matchups, which should also make her more appealing as a Pro pick in specific situations. Before 11.18, Qiyana's E+Q auto aim combo used to be undodgeable. We changed her E+Q targeting mechanism last patch so that enemies could escape by dashing or flashing away. However, that version of the combo generously treated every enemy dash as an attempt to dodge Qiyana's combo, and it turns out this isn't always the case. A dashing enemy might be headed towards the same direction or even the exact same location as Qiyana's E. So in scenarios where the dashing enemy ends up still within Qiyana's default attack range, she'll maintain her auto aim. Lastly, Qiyana jungle is not quite playable yet, so we're bumping that up to give her a fair shot. We over swung on Renekton's nerf last patch. We still believe reducing the stun on his empowered W was a step in the right direction to mitigate his Pro dominance, so we're improving its look and feel. We're also giving him more chances to start fights and increasing his tankiness. Ryze has risen above the other mid laners in most regions. We're nerfing his overall output to ensure he doesn't completely dominate at Worlds. Sejuani has been a bit of a boar lately. We’re slightly boosting her damage and giving her more access to her Q so she can stir up some more action! Seraphine's been weak across the board, so we're giving her some more chances to make sick beats plays instead of just sitting backstage to scale. Sion isn't doing so hot right now, so we're carefully buffing his shield to help him lane more stably. Sona's songs have been a bit too powerful, especially in Skilled play. In addition to a few bugfixes, we're nerfing her base defenses a bit, all of which should add up to an appropriate nerf for the virtuoso. Soraka got a bit too powerful with her new ability to cleanse Grievous Wounds before applying her buffed ult's heal. We still think this strategy works to help her against heal reduction, so we're just tapping down the numbers. Our 11.15 nerfs to Sylas's Q and W restrained him more than intended. We're offering him back some power by easing up on his mana constraints in lane, allowing him to be more proactive with his spells earlier in the game. Varus' last nerf missed the mark, so we're going a bit harder with a pointed focus on his Lethality builds, which are more reliant on his Q. (As a reminder, his Q cooldown can get partial refunds with stacks from W - Blighted Quiver's passive.) Sharpen your spatulas, because URF returns with 11.19, just in time for Worlds! It's time to stretch those fingers and get ready to mash those keyboards. We've also made some important updates to URF below. In this run of URF, we’re using a new balancing strategy for mode-specific champion adjustments. Historically, we've aimed for 50% ideal winrate without incorporating how champions were balanced on classic Summoner's Rift (SR). We realized it didn't quite make sense for us to be toiling at something that already has a great solution, so we're choosing to align closer to existing numbers in classic SR. Instead of aiming for 50% winrates for across the board, our new strategy is to adjust champions in URF (and future game modes) to be closer to their SR winrates. This better accommodates the varied circumstances for why champions don't sit at 50% on normal SR, such as low playrate or niche gameplay. Since this direction can imply a number of changes, most* of the URF regular champion adjustments will be removed for the first couple of days of patch 11.19. This includes the percentage modifiers to damage dealt, damage received, healing, and shielding. Individual mechanical changes, like Aurelion Sol getting more than three stars, are staying in place. A mid-patch update will occur part of the way into 11.19 that will then balance champions on URF to our new targets. In past versions of URF, we nerfed shielding only on champion ability shield ratios. To make sure we don’t miss new champions, champion VGUs, and heftier patch changes, we’re nerfing all shields across all champions consistently—just like we already do for healing. When we last updated the gold values for minions on SR waaay back, URF was not adjusted to match. We’re fixing that and basing the new values on a simple percentage increase relative to SR. This'll make the differences easier to understand and less likely to diverge in the future while only slightly reducing the overall gold in URF in the early game. We're adding new AFK penalty tiers to take stronger action against serial AFKers and ensure a healthier game experience. Players who progress through AFK penalty tiers will now be subject to a new queue lockout penalty at higher tiers in addition to queue delays. Queue delays reset if an AFK is detected during any of the five queue-delayed games. These delays and lockouts apply to all queues except for Clash and TFT. Penalties will roll out in NA and LAS this patch for initial testing, and everywhere else next patch. For a longer write-up, check out our recent blog. Since updating the client's version of CEF (Chromium Embedded Framework) in patch 11.17, we've seen significant improvements in the performance, reliability, and stability of the League client. Check out the latest update of the Client Cleanup Campaign for more details! However, we've also noticed that the upgrade doesn't play nice with outdated drivers, so please check if your video card drivers and OS are up to date if you're experiencing new issues with the client."
11.20,2021-10-05,"Attention all ghouls, ghosts, and spooky scary skeletons! The magic dust from the last two patches may have settled, but we have a few more tricks and treats in store for the rest of this season. This patch has a handful of champion tweaks to keep things brewing smoothly, plus a set of bewitching new skins to doot boot. Hope you caught the first day of Worlds 2021—it's off to a wicked start. With TFT’s Worlds patch behind us as well, this next one is sure to cast (on you) a spell. Check out the full TFT patch notes here! Amumu's gotten a little too strong in both jungle and support. He's uncharacteristically made lots of friends in bot lane, so we're nerfing him a little more there. Darius hasn't been all that commanding lately. We're buffing his sidelane pushing and dueling powers while making his W more of a one-point wonder. Elise keeps getting trampled underfoot by monsters and foes in the jungle, so we're boosting her carapace to help her survivability. (That's spider-speak for defense, by the way.) Hecarim used to stampede over Pro play with his full tank builds but has since become more of a fighter. We're helping him continue in this new direction with a chance to get a second W cast in fights, plus a buff to his sustain and clear. Playing Irelia late game shouldn't be a total waltz in the park. She's succeeding too easily—especially when she stacks heavy AD items like Sterak's and Goredrinker—so we're cutting down on the bladedancer's passive boost late. Jarvan IV's been dominating the jungle meta with his exemplary ganks and super fast clear. We're partially reverting his 11.16 buffs—more specifically, the part that helped his dueling and clearing capabilities. Shen's tipping the top lane tank meta out of equilibrium. We're reverting the 10.15 buff to his shield to restore some of the balance. The mad chemist has gotten a little out of hand ever since we added a couple tricks to his name, like Grievous Wounds on his R+Q. Reducing the output on one of his less signature moves should keep him in smog check. Taliyah is doing a bit too well in the jungle after her latest set of buffs. We're helping her stay grounded without eroding her rediscovered powers in mid. Tank phoenix Udyr was a menace in Pro earlier this season thanks to items like Turbo Chemtank. The meta's changed quite a bit since then, and it's left him in a pretty sad state. We're reverting the 11.12 nerf on his R to let him spread his wings once again. Imperial Mandate hasn't been a strong choice for most enchanter supports and bot lane mages. We're giving it the royal treatment with a damage boost to make it more viable as a Mythic. Smite has always been a powerful spell to heal your way out of death in the jungle, but it's doing this a little too well. We're partially reverting the 11.10 Smite changes to reign it in. To compensate, we’re reducing a couple of the stronger camps' base damage to help early game clear. Unbound Thresh, originally released as an Event Token exclusive during Sentinels of Light, will be added to the store as a regularly-purchasable 750 RP skin. We're also making splash and in-game adjustments to better match Thresh's face with his appearance in the Thresh Unbound: A Night at the Inn video!"
11.21,2021-10-19,"Knock knock. Who's there? Knock. Knock who? Knockout rounds! Groups and play-ins were heckin' hype, and the Worlds train isn't stopping anytime soon! This patch, we've got lots of champion and rune adjustments chugging along, as well as a very big change to Goredrinker to keep fighters on track. New Dragonmancer skins also make their landing this week, and each one's got a mighty personality. Tune into the quarter and semifinals these next couple of weekends as we draw closer to crowning the Season 2021 winners! Rise and grind tacticians, 'cause it’s the last patch before the new set, Gizmos & Gadgets. So read all about the changes in the TFT patch notes here! Starting this patch, /all chat will be disabled in matchmade queues in a few regions. Since our original announcement, response has varied between regions, so we're shifting our approach and only disabling /all chat where players were most receptive to trying it out. This test will last for 11.21 and 11.22. In regions where the disable rolls out, /all chat will still be available in custom games, and no other tools are being disabled. We'll evaluate the impact of this change through verbal abuse reports, penalty rates, surveys, and direct feedback. When the test ends, we may leave /all chat disabled, make changes to the disable, or turn it back on, on a per-region basis. We may also make adjustments during the test itself based on initial results. Akshan's been steadily creeping up since swinging into release. We're tapping down on his signature move's damage to make the choice between maxing Q or E first a bit more strategic. Graves' defensive dueling power makes his laning a little too consistent in some early matchups. We're reducing his burliness to give his opponents a chance to outplay the outlaw. Jinx is craving some excitement, so we're boosting her passive to make her pop-off moments really pop and letting her wreak more havoc across the map with her ult. Flame Chompers' range is also getting a slight increase to work better with Fishbones' basic attacks. Everybody, panic! Karthus bot gets almost infinite wave control in early game thanks to his E passive. Pretty spooky. We're trimming down his mana early to target his performance in lane without affecting his jungle. Despite increasing her E damage in 11.10, Lux still isn't shining so bright in either mid or support. We're taking this opportunity to buff her a bit while also making her passive more reliable. Miss Fortune has been popular at every level of play, including at Worlds. We want to preserve the flexibility between her lethality and crit builds, so we're nerfing her in a way that forces her to pick her early shots more wisely. Quinn's been flying high above her competition in top lane. We're dropping her to a lower elevation so that her enemies can stand a chance against her in duels. Our most recent buffs to Sion's shield in 11.19 were clearly not strong enough for the juggernaut, so... Here he is again! Captain Teemo's fallen behind in the top lane ranks. We're putting a little more anti-basic attack poison in the friendly yordle's dart to make him more annoying powerful in lane. The last set of Viego nerfs did the job and prevented him from dominating at Worlds, but it hit him a little too hard at all levels of play. We're buffing him slightly with an emphasis on his crit builds rather than bringing back some of his tankiness. We've carefully buffed Xayah quite a few times this season to help her non-Pro performance, but she's still pretty weak across the board. Her damage is already pretty sharp, so we're buffing her ability to set her feathers up. At its core, Goredrinker is supposed to be a sustain Mythic that lets fighters outlast their enemies with well-timed Thirsting Slashes. While wanting to sustain through a fight isn't unique to fighters, it's a big part of their class identity: They have the best tools to stay on the offensive at low health (ex. the dream Illaoi ult that lets her turn a 1v5). At the same time, this is a risky niche to fill: Two of our bigger rough patches since the item update have been damage and healing, and Goredrinker offers both. We've seen this risk play out over the course of the season, with Goredrinker becoming the dominant Mythic pick for fighters due to offering the best sustain without making sufficient tradeoffs on the damage front. As further evidence,assassins have been taking Goredrinker over their own Mythics. Assassins are designed to kill quickly, so they shouldn't be valuing an item that indexes so much into sustain and strength at low health. Between its 1.0 AD ratio and its heal, Goredrinker's active is just too valuable as another button in assassin combos that also lets them shrug off any damage they take while eviscerating their target.In order to move Goredrinker back into its sustain niche, we're removing its low-health bonus AD (to nerf damage for fighters) and weakening Thirsting Slash's AD scaling (to nerf damage for assassins). At the same time, we don't want Goredrinker to become a bad pick for fighters, so we're giving it omnivamp to make sure it still lives up to its identity as their sustain Mythic. We’re adjusting Ironspike Whip's active to match Goredrinker's reduced offensive capabilities. We’re also adjusting Stridebreaker's active to match the damage changes to Goredrinker and Ironspike Whip, but it's also getting an AD boost to compensate since it doesn't need a nerf right now. We're seeing a broad range of champions pick Conqueror even in situations that don't match its purpose: extended all-ins. We're honing in on that identity and giving it a nerf. Guardian's been overperforming in the support role and crowding out other keystones, so we're tuning it down. The health shard is a niche stat that doesn't get a lot of love right now. It's generally useful when you don't expect much of a threat in lane (since armor or magic resist shards would be more useful against specific matchups). It's not getting picked much even in these cases, so we're upping its numbers to make it more desirable. At the beginning of the season, we updated Ingenious Hunter to work not only on item actives and trinkets, but also on item passives like Guardian Angel and Sterak's Gage. It was slightly nerfed to compensate and has been weak ever since, so we're giving it a buff to compete with the other Hunter options. Ravenous Hunter is one of the most popular minor runes in the game. It's crowding out other choices, especially in bot lane, so we're nerfing it a bit."
11.22,2021-11-02,"Season 2021 is coming to an end, but the party's just getting started. Who will win Worlds this weekend? It all comes down to these final moments of MAKE/BREAK 2021. Along with the end of the season, we have Clash rewards, Arcane skins, and Victorious Blitzcrank. Then there’s the usual champion buffs and nerfs along with a readjustment to Goredrinker. And last—but certainly not least—Arcane will be released this weekend, and we have tons of exciting content and events to celebrate. RIP our pick 'ems, best of luck on the final climb, and enjoy the show! In TFT-land, the new Gizmos & Gadgets set has arrived. Read all about the changes in the TFT patch notes here! Both Vi and Xayah have gotten a little too strong. We're making a couple of urgent balance adjustments for a fairer end-of-season climb. For the month of November during RiotX Arcane, we’ll be diving deeper into the world of Arcane in celebration of its launch! Come join the party on Summoner’s Rift with Into the Arcane, featuring Arcane-themed map accents, free-to-earn Arcane-inspired skins, and two new interactive experiences coming later in the patch. Check out the Into the Arcane event site for more details! Akali is steel weak across the board, and considering she's still not showing up in Pro, we have some leeway to help her passive shine as an important part of her gameplay. Graves' unique attacks have a generous crit ratio because, back in ye olden item system, his crit builds were risky. Season 2021's item changes made building crit super safe for him, so we're tapping down the numbers on his pellet ratios. Kalista's late game payout for skewering her enemies isn't all that satisfying, so we're bringing up the damage on her signature spell. This should also open up the opportunity for her to try heavier AD builds. Red Kayn took a bigger damage hit than other fighters with last patch's Goredrinker nerfs, so we're returning some damage to his kit. Additionally, his ultimate has felt a bit lackluster early game, so we're bumping up its power. ""Change is good,"" he said. But this bug almost got through the entire season without any changes! Kha'Zix has been generally strong all season, and now that many competing junglers have gotten nerfed, he's become really popular. His power has recently crept up from strong to OP, so we're tuning down his damage. Maokai's tanky support builds have been excelling in solo queue and even surpassing his already powerful AP support builds. We’re pruning his early game pressure and durability, and returning it later in the game for solo lane Maokai (which is also strong, but not as popular). Qiyana is too strong in Elite play but weak in Average play, so we're moving some power around instead of straight nerfing her. Elite players are very efficient at capitalizing on early leads and quickly snowballing their gold, so we're trading in some of Qiyana's early power and gold scaling for some level-based power that should be more available to the average Qiyana player. The changes to Renekton's stun in 11.18 helped lower his popularity in Pro play, but it came at way too big of a cost. We're reverting those nerfs and will be looking for other ways to make sure the croc doesn't take a bite out of the pro scene again. Riven was hit unusually hard by the Goredrinker nerfs and was particularly weak in patch 11.21, especially in Average play. Even with the small buffs to Goredrinker this patch, Riven still needs a bit of love, so we're redeeming her damage and shield. Our nerfs to lethality Varus were a little too piercing, so we're giving him some power back to promote his lethality playstyle but at a bit shorter-range than his Q. On-hit builds continue to perform solidly on Varus, and we don't believe this buff will push them over the top. Vi could use some modernization to keep up with her sister, so we’re fixing some of the inconsistencies with how she acquires and CCs targets. These changes will enable Vi to reliably hit enemies she flashes on top of during her Q dash as well as knockup (and knockback) targets more consistently. Only the finest for Piltover's finest. Yuumi's been top cat at Worlds while also pawing at a very high banrate in solo queue. We're targeting her Zoomies specifically since it's one of her most frustrating aspects in longer games. It also doesn't need to be as powerful thanks to her early game buffs in patch 11.18. Overall, these changes should encourage Yuumi to be more active and helpful to her allies in lane, and not as frustrating to enemies later in the game. We made some pretty substantial changes to Goredrinker last patch, and it turns out we overshot the nerfs. As we discussed in the last patch notes, Goredrinker is designed for outlasting enemies, so we're pushing buffs into its durability and sustain. These changes should help bring it back up, but not to its past popularity."
11.23,2021-11-16,"BOOM, baby! Preseason 2022 is here, and it's BIG! Patch 11.23 brings sweeping changes to the Rift (literally and figuratively) with the new Chemtech & Hextech Drakes, 6 new items, 24 item updates, 3 changes to runes, and Objective Bounties! Ultimate Spellbook is also back with dozens of new Ult-ernates and a special treat for junglers. We're also diving deeper Into the Arcane this week. Continue exploring the story behind Jinx & Vi with new events, thematic updates in-game, secret Council Archives, and interactive content online! Preseason is our very own kind of Progress Days on the Rift. There are tons of experiments and discoveries to make—innovate your heart out! Speaking of innovation, TFT's first balance patch of Gizmos & Gadgets is here. Read all about the change at the TFT patch notes here! Every legend has a beginning, and we hope you're enjoying Arcane's. But there's even more to the lore than just the show! Check out all the Arcane-inspired League of Legends content below and in Into the Arcane. Objective Bounties are another way for losing teams to get back into the game, in addition to Champion Bounties. They grant extra gold rewards for taking objectives when a team is far behind, and are designed to be hard to claim—but not impossible! We still want the winning team's leads to matter, so losing teams will have to capture multiple objectives in order to cash out, because a single bounty won't pay out very much. We hope that Objective Bounties will allow you to execute big brain strats to equalize the game, rather than having to wait around to capitalize on your opponent's mistakes. Objective Bounties activate only when a team is sufficiently behind and objectives that'll pay out bounties are highlighted on the minimap for both teams. If the losing team takes an objective with an active bounty, each of its members will receive Objective Bounty gold. Objective Bounties are calculated in the background based on four factors: XP lead, Gold lead, Dragon lead, and Turret lead. When they activate, each objective available to the team that's behind gains a bounty. Bounties start at the following, split evenly amongst all five team members. As the losing team falls farther behind, these base amounts can increase up to an additional 60%. The exact bounty for each reward will be visible under the losing team's objective icons in the tab-menu. Objective Bounties activate 15 seconds after a team falls below the threshold and deactivate 15 seconds after they rise above it. This deactivation timer extends if the losing team remains in combat with an objective that has an active bounty. We're introducing two new dragons to Summoner's Rift, complete with new buffs, souls, and terrain effects. The selection rate of Chemtech Rift and Hextech Rift terrains will be temporarily doubled during patch 11.23 only so you can try out the new map changes and dragon souls more frequently during preseason. Chemtech Drake is all about playing on the edge, taking calculated risks, and fighting for every scrap. The Chemtech Dragon Soul encourages you to go big or go home, and trade your life for high value plays. Hextech Drake is all about controlling the map, flanking your foes, and trapping the enemy team for a wombo combo. The Hextech Dragon Soul grants a unique lightning that slows down enemies, allowing you to control teamfights and chase down stragglers. The Cloud Drake buff wasn’t getting much love this year, despite being very powerful. It was hard to tune because it needed to give a lot of ultimate Ability Haste to be a powerful reward, but not so powerful that it’d completely warp the game. So we're making some adjustments. Run like the wind! (Cloud Dragon Soul and Cloud Rift are unchanged.) The first Rift Scuttler spawn has been too impactful in deciding the outcome of the early game, so we're reducing its importance with lessened XP. Now that it's squishier (and tinier), you can defeat it more easily and scuttle back to safety sooner. We’re adding some new items for mages, tanks, bruisers, and assassins, who have all been lacking meaningful options since the item system update last preseason. Mages have often felt at the mercy of their bursty foes with little else to do but hide on the far side of teamfights or hope their Stopwatch is enough to survive. This new Mythic lets them sacrifice some early damage for the chance to live longer—especially in the early game, when a completed Zhonya’s may not be a good option. Tanky supports felt pigeonholed into one Mythic (Locket of the Iron Solari) which was a purely defensive tool. We're adding another Mythic for those who want to focus more on engaging offensively instead of relying on Locket's anti-burst. Prior to the Youmuu’s Ghostblade buffs in patch 11.17, there weren’t many options for assassins to pick up Ability Haste. Axiom Arc is a new Legendary item designed to be the Ability Haste pick-up while also allowing ability-focused assassins to snowball a lead. Offensive options for mages have been quite narrow, especially for those who wanted Legendary items to simply deal more damage. Shadowflame should let you blow up your opponents and will be extra spicy against those who stop your damage with shields on shields on shields. Tanks who need mana can really struggle during teamfights as they slowly grind through their mana bars. Let the spell spamming commence. (Thanks, Wild Rift!) Tank Mythics sort of feel like reskins of each other right now, and the choices aren't very cool or satisfying—just a bunch of different ways to burn people. These updates should create more distinction while still giving you the durability you need to succeed. We also gave the tank Mythic passives a bit more health so your stats progress better throughout the game. Tank Legendaries had a different issue where the MR options felt really light aside from Spirit Visage, so we're heightening the fantasies of other choices like Force of Nature and Abyssal Mask. Immolate was meant to help with waveclear but would instead often throw off your CSing because your own minions would steal the last hits. We’re adding a small QoL helper to help you miss fewer of them. This update takes effect on all items that have the passive. In order to differentiate the Immolate tank Mythics, we've shifted some of Frostfire's power into its ""signature"" effect—the Snowbind AoE passive. This chunky hit should make chasing down and debilitating enemies much more satisfying. Caution: Icy surface ahead! Turbo Chemtank's Immolate effect often felt more like a requirement for jungle clear rather than an interesting passive. We're shifting the item's power into one big explosion, which should make it the go-to option for gankers and initiators that just gotta go fast. Sunfire Aegis is the most expensive tank Mythic, yet its stats are a bit underwhelming. We're buffing up its durability to match its cost. Last season’s Abyssal Mask was powerful for champs who could use its Immobilize effect, and pretty much those champs only. We've reshaped it to be more of a hybrid offense/defense tool that shines against magic damage comps or large teamfights. It should also be an exciting choice for some AP bruisers and battlemages! Force of Nature was meant to fill the void Adaptive Helm left behind, but its value straddles between stacking resistances and movement speed. We've condensed and buffed its effects a bit; it should now be the go-to option when facing heavy magic damage comps or high-DPS mages like Ryze or Cassiopeia. Knight's Vow was unpopular despite being powerful all year. We've returned the ally heal so that Pledge feels more like a mutual partnership rather than a selfless sacrifice. We've also sharpened the damage reduction to work better against burst damage, and removed the movement speed boost. We're dropping the price of Aegis to make it more accessible in tank builds, especially for supports. Sunfire Aegis and Locket of the Iron Solari are still strong, so their total costs are unchanged. Gargoyle Stoneplate is relatively weak compared to others though, so it's inheriting the discount. Mage item choices have been pretty limited this season, especially for AP bruisers and some battlemages. We're making a few options less generic but otherwise opening up items to appeal to all AP users. We want to offer a cheaper tier of Mythics for AP mana users who don't need ""luxury"" damage options right away, so we're bringing Everfrost’s price down to match the new mage Mythic, Crown of the Shattered Queen. This way, mana users can opt into cheaper items if they need an earlier spike. Demonic Embrace should be a core item for AP bruisers, battlemages, and tanks who want more damage. It wasn’t fulfilling that role very well, so we’re removing its stacking resistance, boosting it for melees, and giving it a new passive that will make those tanky AP builds shine. Archangel's and Seraph's were basically just big powerful sticks of AP and mana this year. We're pushing them to better fit spell-slinging battlemage and bruiser playstyles. Cosmic Drive was strong throughout the season… but not very exciting. We're amping up the fantasy of this move-fast-cast-fast item and making its passive available way sooner. Horizon Focus was a pretty niche, glass-cannon item that essentially gave long-range mages a lot of bonus damage. We're broadening its use case so that more champs feel happy picking it up. Void Staff was a very powerful but generic purchase for amping up your AP and melting through MR. We’re shifting some of its power to its magic penetration so it’s not a one-stop-shop for mages who buy it. We’re adding an incentive to Doran’s Ring for champions who want to get aggressive in lane. We still want champions to have access to mana in tough matchups, so we’re keeping the base mana regeneration relatively high—now there's just a bonus treat for dueling. Hextech Alternator was one of many AP damage items that were a bit too glass cannon-y. We're trading some of its AP for durability. This change affects Horizon Focus and the next three items, all of which build from Hextech Alternator. While assassins were strong, their Mythics felt lackluster. Many assassins were opting into Mythics like Goredrinker or Stridebreaker, and some rushed Legendaries like Youmuu's before their Mythic. We're not opposed to flexing into unique builds, but building a Lethality Mythic first was almost always the weaker option. We're reducing the gap between Mythics and Youmuu's for melee Lethality users, while ranged Lethality users should be relatively unaffected. First Strike is a new Inspiration keystone that gives you a huge damage and gold boost when you strike an enemy champion first, but nothing if they hit you first. It's been great for artillery champions and assassins during playtests, and we're excited to see you experiment with it! You can read more details behind its design here. With the introduction of First Strike, it's also time we say goodbye to Prototype: Omnistone, a keystone that never really found a place in most players’ hearts. Its rules were too complex, and tinkering with it risked making it even harder to master. This left us in a tough spot where we couldn’t safely buff it because of its potential to warp gameplay in ways we weren't comfortable with. Some champions were using Glacial Augment's Freeze Ray to CC enemies before casting skillshots to guarantee a wombo combo, which—though clever—wasn’t the intended design. This updated version should appeal to tanks and some enchanters without removing skill expression. We think it'll be particularly useful to defend allies or amplify huge engages. The keystones available for marksmen felt a little flat. Hail of Blades offered a burst of instant attack speed, Lethal Tempo a delayed burst of attack speed, and Press the Attack a delayed burst of damage. Lethal Tempo stood out as the least popular of the bunch despite having a similar win rate. This meant it was either more niche, less satisfying, or both. We're clarifying Lethal Tempo's identity as the best ramping option for long term value and adding attack range to make it more unique. Ultimate Spellbook is back—with a twist! (If you need a refresher, the original rules can be found here.) We've added several new ultimates to the pool of Ult-ernate Summoner Spells, champion select bans, a new auto-smite feature for junglers, and special interactions with the new Chemtech and Hextech Drakes! Ultimate Spellbook will incorporate all of preseason’s content upon release (except for Objective Bounties) and will be available from November 18, 2021 to January 10, 2022. As a catch-all note, any changes that have been made to champion ults since patch 11.14 (the last run of Ultimate Spellbook) have also been applied to their Ult-ernate versions in this mode. The only exception is the following bonus Ability Haste reduction on Ashe's R. Jungle mains around the world, rejoice! We're introducing a special feature called Auto-Smite so that junglers can still pick a Summoner Spell other than Smite in this mode. Junglers will be locked into taking Auto-Smite instead of a Placeholder Ult-ernate Summoner Spell during champ select. Auto-Smite gets replaced by the Ult-ernate that you select at the beginning of the game, granting you a buff that is also called Auto-Smite. We're also introducing a new jungle starter item called Obsidian Edge that will only be available on Ultimate Spellbook. It has the same stats as the other two jungle items, but with a different completion criteria just for Auto-Smite and without Chilling or Challenging Smite's effects against champs (since you can't Auto-Smite a champion). Lastly, Ivern's Auto-Smite works a little differently because, well, Ivern. The only dragons that will spawn in this mode are the new Hextech and Chemtech Drakes! Any time your team slays one of these dragons in Ultimate Spellbook, your team will also gain a stack of the Echoes of Ruination buff. In order to streamline Caitlyn's future visuals, skins, and overall development, we've given the Sheriff of Piltover an Art and Sustainability Update (ASU)! In-game models, voiceovers (VO), sound effects (SFX), and visual effects (VFX) for Caitlyn and eight of her skins have been modernized. All of her splashes have also been updated, and some have been completely redone. Jayce and Jinx have also been modernized for clarity and thematic purposes. During this ASU, Caitlyn's Headshots were re-coded as empowered attacks rather than abilities. This removed several cases where Caitlyn was able to Headshot while her basic attack was on cooldown since Headshots now use her basic attack timer. We're monitoring Caitlyn's performance—especially at high skill levels—to ensure this doesn't unintentionally nerf her. The following changes apply to Base, Arcade, Prestige Arcade, Headhunter, Lunar Wraith, Officer, Pool Party, and Safari Caitlyn, except for the new VO. VFXs, SFXs, splash arts, and in-game models for these skins have been updated to varying degrees. The following updates apply to base and Debonair Jayce only (except for the VO). VFX and in-game models for Debonair, Forsaken, Full Metal, Jayce Brighthammer, and Resistance Jayce have also been updated to varying degrees. The following updates apply to Base, Ambitious Elf, Crime City, Heartseeker, Firecracker, Odyssey, and Zombie Slayer Jinx. Crime City, Firecracker, and Zombie Slayer Jinx's in-game models have been cleaned up to varying degrees. Based on initial results since we originally disabled /all chat in a few regions in patch 11.21, we're continuing the disable where it's already in effect but we’re not adding additional regions. From here on out, we'll message any per-region changes to impacted regions only, unless we've got global updates to share. Summoner's Rift Ranked and Honor End of Season Rewards will be distributed starting this patch and will be completed by December 16 (Riot Regions and Garena only). Clash End of Season Rewards will be distributed starting this patch and will be completed by December 16 (Riot Regions only). Tencent will distribute Ranked and Clash rewards for players in China during patch 11.24. You can find more details at the Player Support page here! Team formation for the first weekend of the Ixtal-themed Clash starts on November 15, and the tournament will be on November 20 and 21. Team formation for the second weekend will open on November 29, and the tournament will be on December 4 and 5. Ixtal Clash is not a part of the regular Clash season. You’ll still be able to earn Ixtal rewards, but your Clash VP track won’t be affected. Drop rates for content from Loot items, now called Loot Odds, will soon be displayed in the Store on the League client! You can now view Loot Odds directly in the client in addition to the existing Hextech Crafting FAQ webpage so you can make better informed decisions at the time of purchase. Loot Odds will roll out slowly all over the globe starting later in patch 11.23. Certain regions have additional regulations around Loot, so it may take additional time for Loot Odds to appear. Numerous item and rune tooltips have been updated to include stat trackers so that players can evaluate the impact of them throughout their games."
11.24,2021-12-07,"We cordially invite you to an exquisite, green tie Debonair affair to celebrate the end of the year! We're keeping it classy this week with sophisticated champion, item, rune, and dragon updates to keep preseason running splendidly. Ultimate Spellbook is also getting a spiffy update, and ARAM players worry not—we have some swanky news for you, too. So get your flashiest outfits ready to greet the new year in glitz and glam! It'll be just grand. Debonair dress code too strict for ya? Head over to the TFT patch notes where the Little Legends won't Debo-care what you wear! Bisous, We're taking care of a few urgent mid-patch balances before we put things on pause for the holidays. Several attack ""resets"" on Caitlyn's Headshots were removed during her ASU. These resets were notoriously difficult to maneuver and were not part of Caitlyn's original design. (Technically, her Headshots executed as abilities rather than empowered basic attacks, which is what allowed the bugged reset functionality.) It wasn't sustainable—or healthy, even—to keep her passive as-is, so we're instead refactoring her Headshot resets in a way that looks smoother and is easier to pull off. Camille is a bit too mobile for the damage she dishes out, so we're limiting access to her ODM gear dashes. We're also nerfing her trading tool so that she doesn't get such a free advantage in lane. Ivern loves all of his forest friends equally, but when push comes to shove, freeing the Krugs isn't really worth the effort. Krugs give significantly less gold and experience than the other small jungle camps, even though it takes Ivern the same amount of time, mana, and health to free them. (This oughta teach 'em how to say thanks!) After reaching level 11, if Kayle has enough stacks, her basic attacks launch waves of fire that travel an extra distance and damage enemies they pass through. The distance these waves travel used to be a flat number. Now, it will scale with her bonus attack range, which can be extended by other effects such as her passive at level 16 or Lethal Tempo. Tank Kled has been optimal for a while because of the massive bonus HP he gets from Skaarl. We're adjusting how his health is calculated to make his playstyle healthier and more interesting. However, this will nerf some of his bruiser builds, so we're buffing his damage and cooldowns to compensate. We'll keep an eye on the cantankerous duo after this change to monitor AD Kled's viability. When Twitch uses his ult, his basic attacks become bolts that travel slightly farther than his attack range and deal damage to enemies in a straight path (similar to Kayle's passive). This distance also used to be a flat number and will now scale with his bonus attack range. Few things feel worse than running out of mana for Samira's ult after getting all her passive stacks ready. This mana cost was originally designed to control her early waveclear, but since that hasn't really been a problem, it became the perfect opportunity to bring her back—in style. Just in case you wanted to run Lethal Tempo on Urgot. It's probably still not a good idea, but... whatever floats your boat spidery-leg-cyborg... vehicle... thingy. Archangel's Staff isn't performing all that well, so we're lowering its cost to help. Axiom Arc is supposed to provide ability-based assassins an exciting teamfight output. However, it's been doing that a little too consistently. Cosmic Drive is significantly overperforming on most champions. Crown of the Shattered Queen is another new mage item that has been doing too well on most champions, especially considering it's supposed to be a more defensive Mythic option. Evenshroud has all but eclipsed its sunnier counterpart (a.k.a. Locket), so we're bringing it in line with the other support Mythics. (These changes also apply to its Ornn Masterwork item, Equinox.) Frostfire Gauntlet is a punch above the other tank Mythics, offering a little bit of everything at a relatively low cost. We're bringing down its damage, which was a bit too high compared to Sunfire, including the health scaling. (These changes also apply to its Ornn Masterwork item, Rimeforged Grasp.) The nerf to Conqueror's duration in 11.21 was a little too restrictive. We're partially reverting the nerf and boosting its damage to make it comparable to other keystones like Grasp of the Undying, Fleet Footwork, and Lethal Tempo. Glacial Augment is the best keystone for many tanks by a large margin right now. We're nerfing it in a way that shouldn't affect its other users. Lethal Tempo is a little too strong for some melee champions. It's also failing to fulfill its attack speed fantasy for ranged users, so we're shifting some of the power from its bonus attack range for them. Now that the dust from its 11.18 buff has settled, it's become clear that this powerful version of Predator is undercutting counterplay. We're reverting that change to address this, especially since Ingenious Hunter's 11.21 buffs helped Predator's viability considerably. The temporarily doubled selection rates of Chemtech Rift and Hextech Rift terrains during patch 11.23 have been removed. All dragon terrains have returned to their normal selection rates. The standard Chemtech Drake Buff is notably weak while, conversely, the Chemtech Dragon Soul is too strong. We're also adding a visual helper so you can identify chemtech zombies better. On the contrary, while Hextech Dragon Soul seems to be in a reasonable place, the standard Hextech Drake Buff could use a boost. Melee champions—especially assassins—have been struggling in ARAM for a while now. We're adding two buffs independent of the champion-specific adjustments to balance accordingly. The first should allow melee champions to push waves more easily. Assassins are a bit harder to balance as fiddling with their numbers in this mode risks diminishing counterplay. Increasing their damage dealt would let them delete enemies before any chance to react, whereas decreasing their damage taken removes opportunities for counter-burst. So instead, we're trying something a little different: AP assassins will now do bonus damage to structures from the start, much sooner than other champions. This later gets replaced by ARAM's a generic time-based buff which, after 18 minutes, grants all champions 0-25% (based on minutes) bonus damage to structures. Champions are adaptively determined as ""AP-scaling"" if they have more bonus AP than bonus AD throughout the game. The breakeven point at which the generic ARAM buff's bonus damage to structures exceeds 20% is approximately 27:36."
12.1,2022-01-04,"Happy new year, folks! Welcome to Season 2022. We're kicking off the new Ranked season with a soft reset, changes to decay, and some visual updates. We also have a few champion and item balances, changes to Teleport, plus a couple of beautiful new Elderwood skins. Well, let's get right on to it, shall we? Check out how TFT is kicking off the year at the TFT patch notes here! Many have come to enjoy Diana jungle since our changes earlier this year, even while she's been distinctly underpowered. We're putting some power back into that role while giving her a bit of a buff that she can also use in mid. Gangplank's Parrrley is not as powerrrful in lane after Grasp was nerfed on him, so we're letting him use it morrre often. Rek'Sai is a bit too strong in skilled play, especially when she maxes E first. We're targeting exactly that while leaving her normal Q max builds relatively unchanged. (As a reminder, E - Furious Bite's damage gets doubled and converted to true damage at maximum Fury stacks.) Sona's been overperforming in skilled play and pushing the limit in other brackets ever since Archangel's Staff was changed in preseason. We're tapping down on her power by slightly reducing her durability and ability cast frequency. Despite being weak overall, Eclipse was the strongest lethality Mythic before preseason. We overdid its buffs a bit in 11.23, so we're partially reverting those. (This change also applies to its Ornn Masterwork item, Syzygy.) Force of Nature's payout was a bit too hard to reach due to the stack duration. It's also been a bit weaker than its counterpart, Spirit Visage, so, naturally, we’re adding more force to make it the heavy magic resist item. Immortal Shieldbow has made some marksmen and fighters a bit too, um, immortal. We're bringing it down a bit so that there are larger tradeoffs to consider when comparing it to other marksman Mythics. (Its Ornn Masterwork Item, Bloodward, will now have 65 AD and the same changes to Lifeline.) Wit's End has been powerful as an early defensive and offensive option for attack speed champions. However, considering its threat as a DPS item, its build path and stats counter magic damage a bit too much, too early. While League of Legends is indeed a team game, it generally evolves in phases—as the game progresses, you interact with your team more. Lane phase lets you flex your individual skills, but it also needs some outside influence to keep things from getting too predictable. However, right now, there’s too much disruption happening too early and too often. This is especially the case with frequent Teleport fights in bot lane. And this isn't bad for bot laners only; top and mid players also lose out on the ability to express their laning skills in the same way. Currently, it often feels like bot lane gets decided by outside influence, and mid and top get decided by the influence they have on bot lane (rather than on how well they play their own lane). Teleport also tends to crowd out other summoner spells because, when wielded properly, it flexibly offers both safety and a high level of game influence. Today, you can use it to quickly get back to your own lane and farm, but you can also use it to intervene in other lanes. In an effort to bring back some balance, we're reshaping the spell by tempering its offensive capabilities early, and then upgrading it later on to retain its exciting mid-to-late game impact. The Summoner's Rift Ranked Season 2022 begins on Friday, January 7, 2022! Check the table below to see what time it starts in your region. All ranked accounts will receive a soft reset of 5 tiers for initial seeding. (For example, Gold I will become Silver II.) This also marks the beginning of the Summoner's Rift Ranked Split 1. The exclusive rewards for Split 1 are as follows. For more information about Ranked Seasons and Splits, check out the Player Support page here. Decay rules for the Apex tiers (a.k.a. Master, Grandmaster, and Challenger) are changing in Season 2022. These changes are intended to correct misplacements and improve the matchmaking experience. (Note that these only apply to Apex tiers. Diamond decay rules are not changing this season.) For more information about placements and decay, check out the Player Support page here. We're laying the groundwork for the new Challenges feature, which will arrive later this year. You'll see some visual updates to your ranked identity and game lobbies starting this patch. In celebration of Ranked Season 2022 Start, there will be a special Forge God Clash tournament with the following special Forge God-themed rewards. Forge God clash will only take place on one weekend. Team formation opens on January 10, with matches taking place on January 15 and 16. Forge God Clash is not part of the regular Clash season. You’ll still be able to earn Forge God-themed rewards, but your Clash VP track won’t be affected. The first Clash tournament of Season 2022, which will count towards the VP track, will be in patch 12.4!"
12.2,2022-01-19,"Zip, zap, and zoom with Zeri, the Spark of Zaun, in patch 12.2! This patch, we're introducing an electrifying new personality to the Rift, plus a ton of champion balance changes. There's a champion refresh for Janna in the forecast as well as more item, dragon, and rune adjustments, too. The Lunar Revel event is also in full moon swing this week! Celebrate the Year of the Tiger with us with special events including the return of ARURF, exciting missions (with reduced points requirements), and beautiful new Porcelain, Firecracker, and Prestige skins. Happy Lunar New Year! Tacticians from across the Convergence are also gathering to celebrate the Lunar Legend Festival with a new event, Gifts of the Golden Lantern. Read all about the event and more at the TFT patch notes! Zip, zap, and zoom across Summoner's Rift with Zeri on January 20! Janna just hasn't felt very rewarding to play over the past few seasons, especially when compared to other enchanter options in bot lane. We wanted to approach this mid-scope update to her while staying true to her classic playstyle and identity. In particular, we believe Janna's ally shielding and peel are what makes her appealing to most enchanter players, so we've shifted some power from her W and poke damage into her Es and Qs. We also made a few nice little QoL changes here and there in hopes of blowing you away~ Lulu's been queen of the bot lane for quite some time now—especially at the highest levels of play—so we're reducing access to her most versatile spell just a pinch! Nocturne has been a nightmare to play as in all skill brackets, regardless of his builds or runes. We're buffing him with some scaling power, so he can become more useful as the game progresses, rather than just relying on his ultimate as his only way to say lights out. Qiyana is dominating Elite play quite a bit right now. We're reducing how much time she gets to spend being invisible in a fight, which should help lower some frustration when playing against the Empress of the Elements. As a primary jungler, this battle kitty has been suffering a lot on the Chemtech Rift. While he's not the only champion affected, Rengar has certainly gotten the worst of it as so much of his power budget is dedicated to his passive's interaction with brush. Removing 12 spots of it is incredibly disruptive—not just to his core farming pattern, but his entire gameplay, really—so we're giving him a new way to pounce and prowl. No catnip needed. (Note that this passive is on his R and only takes effect once he ranks up his ultimate.) Now that her mid-game transition is less reliable with the Shieldbow nerfs, we're giving Samira a bit more baseline potential in her R so she can snowball in style. Senna is quite weak this season, especially when she builds for DPS. The old Glacial Augment was a crucial part of that playstyle and since it no longer procs off Senna's basic attacks, we're adding some utility back into her kit. With the changes to Teleport in 12.1, Shen has once again become king when it comes to map influence from top lane. To bring things back to equilibrium, we're lowering his damage as a duelist instead of bringing down his cross-map power so that his unique, global presence remains his most powerful tool. We did a mini-rework of Tahm Kench back in 11.13 because his old kit held huge advantages in highly coordinated team play. Our goal back then was to lower his priority in Pro pick/ban while putting him in a place where he could have a fun playstyle, as well as reasonable winrates in both of his roles. (Historically, his top lane winrate has been higher than that of his support.) The rework is looking pretty good so far in terms of Pro play as he doesn't have nearly as much priority there as he used to. When it comes to his winrates, the rework didn't dramatically affect the difference between his support versus top capabilities, but it did highlight the gap. This left support Tahm Kench players feeling like the catfish was no longer viable in their role. Now that we've had some time to observe all of these effects together, we're willing to take a riskier swing to buff support Kench while nerfing his top lane capabilities to keep him in check up there. We introduced Talon jungle in 11.18 in hopes of bringing new players and playstyles into the jungle. He ended up becoming one of the stronger jungle assassins, especially in Elite play where his mobility, damage, and clear speed are almost unmatched. He's still extremely fun as a flex pick, but we also understand that his current state has very few weaknesses, which can be frustrating to play against. In turn, we're heavily nerfing his clear speed to tune him down. He'll still be viable there and will keep his high-mobility edge, but you might need to think a little longer before jumping into the jungle with him. Our rocket girl isn't doing so hot lately. Her abilities already hit super hard, but they're pretty risky and can take a while to stack up. We're bumping up her early durability to give Tristana the time she needs to finish her combos and survive those explosive plays. The tiny master of evil has been less threatening than usual as of late. We're upping the rate on his Phenomenal Evil stacks so that he can stand above his competitors in the mid lane. (Figuratively speaking, at least.) The once-fearsome Volibear is bad for everyone, everywhere. We're giving him a reliable baseline stat buff and more access to his signature stormy skill. Like Samira, the wind brothers were hit hard by the Immortal Shieldbow nerfs. We're compensating for this by returning some of that power into their more skill-dependent abilities. Of course, we have to do the same for Yone to make sure he doesn't fall behind in the sibling rivalry. Zed has been creeping up from the shadows in terms of both power and ban rate. We're tapping him back down in a way that will require him to make better use of his base kit to secure kills. At the start of Season 2021, we revamped Lich Bane to broaden its user base by removing its ability haste and increasing Spellblade's damage and cooldown. These changes made it very powerful as a burst tool, but that burst also got a few nerfs throughout the year. As a result, Lich Bane was left feeling pretty underwhelming for its core users, so we're partially restoring it to a healthier state. Rylai's has been struggling to find its place in the last couple of seasons because it's been trying to serve tanky battlemages, burn mages, and AP supports alike all at once. We're focusing on its purpose as a utility item by lowering its cost and increasing its health to make it more accessible to tankier midrange mages and supports. Turbo Chemtank's update during Preseason 2022 was designed to let tanky gankers and initiators store movement into one big turbo blast for those moments when they gotta go fast. However, Refuel was stacking too well with dashes, which meant it was being used as a DPS source for non-tanks. While we admire the creativity here, Turbo Chemtank is supposed to be for, well, tanks, so we're adding some limits to the way its passive stacks. Ultimately, these adjustments shouldn't affect its intended use cases very much. (These changes also apply to its Ornn Masterwork item, Turbocharged Hexperiment.) The Chemtech Dragon Soul is still significantly overperforming compared to other dragon soul buffs. We're nerfing the undeads' health and, uh, longevity. Expected lifetime? Active duration? ... You get what we mean. We're making a few changes to make the ahead team slightly less advantaged when fighting in the Chemtech rift. (Now's a good time to mention we stealth-nerfed (heh) the Chemtech Rift last patch. At launch, champions instantly entered camouflage when they entered the fog. In 11.24, we made the camouflage timer check if you've made any offensive moves in the last 1.5 seconds upon entering the fog as well. The only change to the camouflage mechanics this patch is an increase to that timer.) Hextech Dragon Soul is also overperforming compared to other soul effects, though not to the same degree as Chemtech. Lethal Tempo's power is skewed a little too much toward early game right now, making it especially cheese for melee champions. We're adjusting it to be weaker early on and letting it scale instead. Ring in the Lunar New Year with ARURF starting on January 26! (That's the All Random Ultra Rapid Fire game mode if you're new around these parts.) Beyond the normal ARURF that you know and love, we added a flipper full of changes to a couple of runes and a few surprises to the Awesome Buff of Awesomely Awesome Buffing's tooltip."
12.3,2022-02-01,"Season 2022 is in bloom! We've carefully plucked a delicate bouquet for you this patch, including several champion nerfs and a significant update to the fighter item system. This is also our first patch reacting to Pro play on the preseason meta, so there's a lot of focus on balancing that skill bracket this week. Ahri's champion refresh is another part of the floral mix and, last but not leaf, the rest of the Crystal Rose and Withered Rose skins will be available soon. ❀ Allergies acting up with all this flowery language? Head on over to the pollen-free TFT patch notes here! Janna's 12.2 changes swept Summoner's Rift by storm, making her one of the strongest and most popular supports. However, it wasn't clear just how strong of a nerf she needed last patch due to a Glacial Augment bug that interacted with her Q and R a little too well. Even after the hotfix, Janna remains very strong with Glacial and other runes, so we're lowering her early roaming power and her enhanced heal and shield window. These changes are not intended to address her (and other enchanters') recent top lane strategy. We're working on a separate solution for that and will update as soon as we have an accurate forecast. Ahri's unique identity as a highly-mobile mage assassin has eroded over the years. Instead of a being flighty terror dashing across a teamfight, she's limited to a single attempt at an exciting play with her R, then fishing with her E from safety for the rest of the fight. To address this, we're refreshing her passive to offer a partial ultimate reset upon takedowns so a well-played Ahri can capitalize on favorable situations to hunt down the entire enemy team. We've also redistributed her abilities’ mana costs and early damage so each spell feels rewarding. To balance things out, we're slightly nerfing her burst damage and defensive stats. (As an aside, these changes are unrelated to Ahri’s upcoming ASU.) Akshan's been quite strong everywhere (especially in top lane), so we're hitting his early passive power to make his harass on melee enemies a bit less dirty. Amumu has been too strong in Average play ever since he got a ton of new items this season. And although flat damage reduction is supposed to shine against champions like Zeri, completely negating certain attacks or abilities is a bit much—especially for an always-on passive—so we're adjusting his E to match similar abilities. We're firing up a couple of quality of life changes to make Brand's passive a little more intuitive, while also optimizing the bounces on his ult. Caitlyn is getting banned really often in Pro play lately, likely because of her ability to shut down many popular late-scaling marksmen. Instead of curtailing her early lane bullying strengths, we're getting on the case by nerfing her wave control and scaling instead. Corki's been taking over Pro play. We're making his lane a bit less safe and lowering his impact on the first dragon and Rift Herald fights by delaying his first package, which used to let him secure a return to combat at the speed of heat. They'll also get restocked at a slower rate so that he can't make special deliveries to every dragon spawn. LeBlanc has been too stranc for too lanc, especially in Pro where she's been popular for a while now. We're tapping down her first-maxed skill to curb her early burst and waveclear. We're making Lillia’s lullaby last a little longer so she can follow up with her spells and help her teammates more consistently at early levels. Sweet dreams~ ♪ It's high tide for a Nami adjustment! This should make the move speed boost on her passive much more noticeable, so you can stop taking your enchanter supports for granted. (Just kidding. Maybe.) She's already pretty strong, so we're balancing out this slight buff with a small nerf to her E. Although Quinn is technically flying fine, her impact has descended a bit across all skill brackets due to various system changes recently. Since she's ended up with some headroom, we're taking this opportunity to improve her gameplay satisfaction. The buff to Senna's Q last patch did make her support stronger as intended, but it also overwhelmingly increased her ADC winrate. Our goal isn't to make ADC Senna weak, but instead to bring her two roles closer together in strength. (Before you grab a calculator, this rounds out to approximately one soul for every six minion waves.) Twisted Fate seems to always have the right cards in Pro play with his global power and consistent CC. We're cutting into his abilities' base stats so he has to buy more AP to dish out big damage instead of opting for his usual utility builds. Zeri's Trinity Force build has ended up being much stronger than expected, skyrocketing her winrate once players swapped over from crit. We're targeting these nerfs to ideally hit her Tri Force build more than her crit ones, but because there's some overlap, we're compensating the latter with a bit more zap on her ult. We're making changes to the fighter system to re-establish the differences between nimbler, more fragile fighters like Fiora and less agile but beefier picks like Darius. Previously, most items were accessible to most fighters thanks to the built-in health. While this made big health-stackers happy, when lighter fighters used these generic items, it would wash out their weaknesses, making them durable yet still high-damage and high-mobility (contrary to their subclass characteristics). Ideally with these changes, each subclass will feel like they have items tailored just for them. For more context, check out our Quick Gameplay Thoughts article about it here. Lastly, we're aware this is a pretty big shift and will be keeping a very close eye on things and almost certainly following up. For fighter Mythics, we're shifting a couple of items from high health, all-in-one purchases into more unique and offensive options. Not all fighters should be tanky and durable, and those who should—like juggernauts—can lean on specific Legendaries for that. Trinity Force is the exception here. We're bumping up its health to make it match the other options in exchange for a small reduction in stacking AD. This way, the amount of health you get won't be the main reason why you choose (or don't choose) a certain Mythic; rather, each Mythic should have its own unique benefits to make that decision clearer and fairer. Our approach to fighter Legendaries is similar: Shift health into AD across select items. Another top priority is to move Sterak's Gage out of being a go-to default option for all fighters. Lighter fighters should now be more intrigued by this reworked Death's Dance, which will scale with your other AD purchases and sustain tools. It also requires fighters to be constantly active in a fight to be effective, which is something we believe is important for systemic lighter fighter survivability. We're also adjusting a few somewhat underpowered Legendaries that should support lighter fighters (like Maw and Ravenous Hydra). These items need to be powerful enough for lighter fighters to consider purchasing them over other options. And finally, a few component items have also been updated to round everything out. Our changes to Turbo Chemtank in patch 12.2 were a bandaid to bring the item back in line on dash-y champs (like Akali and Irelia) while we looked for better solutions. We're further adjusting its stacking mechanics to make Turbo Chemtank better suited for ""tanking"" rather than for ""turbo charging"" at enemies. Emphasis on the tank, not the turbo. (These changes also apply to its Ornn Masterwork item, Turbocharged Hexperiment.) This update should make Vel'Koz's VFX more Void-y and his hitbox indicators more accurate."
12.4,2022-02-15,"Patches are like a box of chocolates. You never know what you’re gonna get—unless you read the patch notes, that is. (Speaking of surprises, we have a new author today!) This patch the Chem-Baroness Ms. Renata Glasc begins her corporate takeover of the Rift. We also have a few buffs for Kalista, Lucian, and Xayah to freshen up the current ADC assortment among other balances. Meanwhile in top lane, things have been a little tense with our enchanter friends, so we have some support gold income changes to help address the current situation. Lastly, be sure to keep your heart rate in check as we introduce a new set of stunning Shockblade skins! And over in TFT, Renata Glasc, Silco, and many more join the updated TFT roster during the mid-set, Neon Nights. Read more about the update over at the TFT patch notes here! Rise to the top with Renata Glasc on February 17! We’re still keeping an eye on the changes to the fighter item system, but it’s clear that Aatrox drew the short sword. This buff should hit the sweet spot. Last patch's nerfs made our mummy a little too sad. His E passive's damage reduction is now capped, so we can return some power to the ability by making the baseline stronger. Ashe has been fairly out of the meta for a while now, so we’re taking the opportunity to give the Frost Archer some more reliable utility with those magical, cross-map ults. We're lowering the robot's innate sustain so that he has to be a little more cautious in lane. Dr. Mundo's been tearing up top lane. We're pulling some of his baseline offensive power so he has to make better use of his medical kit to successfully sedate his patients. Illaoi hasn't found her footing yet this season, and the fighter item changes haven't done the priestess any favors either. She can already hit some wildly high highs, so we're bolstering her baselines to help her release the kraken. The Spear of Vengeance hasn’t been very scary recently. We’re buffing her so she can play more aggressively early and survive lane more reliably. The Sentinel of Light hasn't actually seen much light this season, so we're letting him use his shining spells more aggressively before he gets Essence Reaver. Last patch, we tide a small nerf to Nami's E when we adjusted her passive so that her power would remain at sea level. It turns out she actually sank a bit as a result, so we're reeling that part of the change back in. Our curious chameleon has been sitting at a low winrate for quite some time and could use a little love. We're trimming down her THICC hitbox to match those of similar characters and giving her more access to her tricks. An extra boost to her blossoms should help her waveclear so she can roam to other lanes more using her camouflage, as well as make her combos really pop-blossom off. Nunu has been playfully toeing the line into OP territory across all brackets for a while now, but this last patch finally broke the ice. We're bringing him and William Willump back into a more reasonable state by tapping down on their general tankiness rather than detracting from their jungle clear and signature snowy skills. The empress continues to be a little too oppressive in higher levels of play, so we’re reducing the AD scaling on her passive to curb her waveclear and snowball potential. Rumble is weak, especially in the top lane. We're fortifying him to be more in line with other melee laners so he can get scrappier with his enemies. The Rift’s #2 mama’s boy (just behind the new patch notes author) has dropped in effectiveness and winrate a bit more than other fighters last patch, so we’re giving him a small buff. Veigar is standing head-and-shoulders above the competition. His shadow is especially tall in bot lane, so we’re adjusting his scaling in a way that’ll impact him more in bot lane than in mid. While we're happy that Xayah has lethality options, they've been overshadowing her crit builds. The Rebel's gameplay is healthier and better suited to her identity when she builds at least some attack speed, so we’re increasing the crit scaling on E - Bladecaller to bring back her fast and furious feathers. Zeri's spark still has a bit more shock than she needs, so we're nerfing her overall power in a way that should hit her bruiser builds harder than her crit builds. You can now display your allies' item cooldowns and charges in-game by pinging an item's icon in the ""Tab"" scoreboard! Item icons in the scoreboard will also have timer VFX to visually indicate their status, similar to those on Summoner Spells. Buying three Rejuvenation Beads has recently cropped up as a powerful item start strategy. However, it offers weak early game champions a bit too much sustain without asking for enough tradeoffs mid-game. We're adjusting it to require some more commitment and will look at changing Doran's items if players struggle to survive, especially in tough solo lanes. Recently, there's been an increase of enchanter support champions in solo lanes who use support gold income items to gain money passively while roaming the map rather than playing in their lane. While we do value creativity in League of Legends, we believe this specific strategy goes over the line for what a healthy amount of early game roaming looks like. It also denies their lane opponents the opportunity to use early-game strengths to build leads during lane phase, which is a core part of each game. These issues definitely call for a more robust solution and we're in the process of developing one. In the meantime, we're adjusting a few systems to minimize the effects on other parts of the game. In particular, both objective and CS bounties don't yet account for unconventional income strategies, which can waterfall into unhealthy game states. We're also increasing the minion farming penalty on these support gold income items during the first 5 minutes of the game so that laners can't just farm as usual, then grab-and-go once the timers kick in. Unrelated to the gold income items above, we're also shortening the deactivation timers for Objective Bounties to address some extreme swing cases. When an Objective Bounty period ends, the losing team should still be behind, but the lingering duration allowed some cases where a losing team could catapult ahead after claiming multiple bounties in a row. The 2022 Clash Season begins! Team formation for the first weekend of Ionia Cup starts on February 14, and the tournaments take place on February 19 and 20. Team formation for the second weekend starts during patch 12.5 on March 1, and the tournaments take place on March 5 and 6."
12.5,2022-03-01,"It’s patch 12.5, beelieve it! This time around, we’ll bee doing a relatively light patch! There will bee some nerfs to stronger champs like Ahri and Gwen, while some champs like Samira and Seraphine support will bee getting some buffs. We’re also taking some of the sting out of Hullbreaker’s power for ranged champions and, most importantbee, we also have some additions to the Bee skinline this patch! As a heads up, patch 12.5 will bee live for one month, with 12.6 going out on March 30. Don’t worry though, we’ll still beekeeping an eye out for any urgent issues that may pop up. Read more about why in this article here!. And, if you need a refresher on the patch release dates, check out our Patch Schedule for 2022 here! Have a bad case of apiphobia? Then come check out the first patch of Neon Nights at the TFT patch notes here, where the only things buzzing in the night are Silco's schemes and robotic dreams! While the changes in 12.5 succeeded in making Yi’s on-hit builds more optimal than his lethality builds, they actually resulted in a large buff to on-hit with roughly no change to lethality-overpowering Yi as a result. We’re tuning Yi down with some stronger nerfs this time, but ensuring that we’re pulling power from across his kit so as to not dramatically impact his gameplay. While we’re happy that players are charmed by Ahri’s refresh in 12.3, she’s been a little too strong since. We’re pulling some power out of her early game to reduce her overall strength. Gwen has been shredding up top and jungle in Pro play for some time now. So we’re snipping off some of her power so her weaknesses are more apparent and her strength as a flex pick is reduced. Kennen hasn’t had much presence in top lane, so we’re giving him some small buffs to shock the current meta. Master Yi’s Duskblade builds have been a bit strong recently, but more importantly are both frustrating to play against and unhealthy for gameplay. We’re decreasing his Q's synergy with lethality and Ability Haste and instead adding on-hit scaling so the Wuju Bladesman is forced to show himself while fighting. We're giving Miss Fortune a quality of life update for struttier spawns. For a thrillseeker, the Desert Rose hasn’t been very daring recently. We’re ramping up her durability over time so she can more comfortably stack her Style in big late-game teamfights before getting focused down. Seraphine's been enjoying the mid lane limelight, but it's clear that players want to share her stage in bot lane, too. We're introducing some buffs to her support kit without turning the volume up too high on her solo performances in mid. Xin’s a staple in Pro play right now, in part due to the consistent and reliable engage of his E combined with the safety of his R. We're targeting some of that engage power while also ensuring his ultimate doesn’t provide him with too much of a safety net. Ranged Hullbreaker users have been taking over top lane, so we’re decreasing its benefits for them. Hullbreaker should still feel like an option for ranged champs, but without overshadowing melee users. The Mythic Content Overhaul begins next patch! 12.5 is your last chance to spend your 2020 Prestige Points! Unlike Gemstones, Prestige Points won't convert to Mythic Essence. USE 'EM NOW IF YOU'VE GOT 'EM! Also, as mentioned last patch, once patch 12.5 releases, you'll no longer be able to claim OG ownership of 2018 and 2019 Prestige skins by obtaining them from loot drops or rerolls. The skins will still appear in drops and rerolls during 12.5, but only those who earned them pre-12.5 will receive a special version of these skins. Prestige and Gemstone skins will be removed from loot drops and rerolls when the Mythic Content Overhaul begins. Team formation for the first weekend of the Freljord Cup starts on March 14, and the tournaments are on March 19 and 20! Team formation for the second weekend starts on March 28, and the tournaments will be on April 2 and 3 during patch 12.6. Based on your feedback, an updated look for ranked borders will be hitting the loading screen in patch 12.5. In addition, Ranked divisions will be visible in game lobbies, hovercards, loading screens, and profiles."
12.6,2022-03-29,"Squad up for patch 12.6! Anima Squad up, that is. It's been a hot minute since the mid-patch 12.5 balances, so there's a lot in store this week. In addition to some spunky new sci-fi skins, we have buffs and nerfs galore, a set of adjustments to Rengar, and systemic changes to sustain items and runes. Phase 1 of the Mythic Content Overhaul is also finally here! Keep reading to find out more about Mythic Essence, the Mythic Shop, unvaulted Prestige skins, and an update on Phase 2. Anyway, back to the Rift—heard norms are looking kinda sus this week, gonna go check that out... Your crime-fighting mecha crew not online for Flex 5s yet? No worries—you can always read about your favorite auto Battle Bunny battler while you wait for 'em over at the TFT patch notes here! We’re currently working on resolving a large number of bugs that were shipped in patch 12.6 and exclusively affect Summoner’s Rift normal draft and blind pick game modes. (Ranked queues are unaffected.) To assist our investigation, please take screenshots or short recordings of any bugs found and tag us on Twitter @LeagueOfLegends so we can address the root cause. We're aiming to ship a batch of fixes on April 3 at 06:00 BST for all issues we identify. We've included a preliminary list below, though we believe there are more still to be found. Thanks for your patience. A little birdy told us that Azir's been weak, and the numbers told us the birdy was right. His lack of Pro presence in a scaling meta that should favor him was the final confirmation, so we're giving him some base stat power that should help the Emperor of Shurima in all skill brackets. Darius has been lagging behind other juggernauts after the fighter item changes, so we're giving him a beefy damage boost. (As a reminder, his ult's total damage can increase by up to 100% based on his passive stacks.) Tankarim is taking over Pro again, so we're nerfing the base damage on some of his abilities to ensure fairer horseplay. No balance changes here; instead, we fixed lots of bugs and updated Illaoi's ult to give her some more control over her tentacles. Jax has been mediocre for a while, so we're giving him some early game power to help him get to his item power spikes. He may not have a real weapon at first, but now he can buy one a little sooner. :^) Human-form Nidalee is a mana-hungry huntress, but her overall kit is much more compatible with the non-mana mage Mythics. We're giving her more access to her utility spells as well as making her AoE range bigger so she can claw enemies and jungle camps more effectively. Lastly, her heal cast range was pretty restrictive (especially for a character with so many other positioning constraints), so we're increasing it to match that of her Bushwhack trap placement. All in all, this should make her more accessible and stronger across all skill brackets. Our big kitty finally has some big changes coming to his kit! Our goals were to smooth out Rengar's gameplay, keep his current playstyle, and clarify his builds. We're going to keep a close eye on the Q crit damage ratio so he doesn't get too out of line. We also know that Q no longer applying on plants can be painful for seasoned players who used this mechanic to optimize Ferocity stacks, but we strongly believe it wasn't healthy to support long term and have instead moved that power to more accessible parts of his kit. Tryndamere is too strong at the highest levels of play. His kit scales too well with Ability Haste, so we're readjusting his cooldowns to account for the higher amounts of Ability Haste available to him through items. Many sustain options were added with the introduction of Mythics last year, especially for early game itemization. We believe sustain is still a compelling choice for Mythic slots, but these options just give a bit too much bang for your buck as they are today. To make the tradeoffs between sustain and power more significant, we're adjusting some life steal choices in a way that better reflects their cost and value. Hopefully you'll see less of those draintanking plays that can happen when these items are stacked, as well as fewer lanes where sustain washes out trades too quickly. Lastly, we've left the fighter system items out of this list since they were recently adjusted and have landed in a pretty good spot in terms of balancing sustain and power. We have a few changes to runes related to the sustain item changes above. Most notably, we're replacing Ravenous Hunter with a new, shiny, and not-sustain-related rune: Treasure Hunter. Ravenous Hunter was too prevalent in the sustain system as it was too easy to access and stack with other runes, items, and abilities. This meant we’ve had to tune down the rune to a pretty sad state to mitigate its potential sustain power. Sustain also felt a bit out of place in Domination, a rune tree that's supposed to be all about aggression. This replacement will give us more room to let sustain shine in the limited places where it still exists, and also reward those aggressive champions that are really looking to ca$$$h in. Phase 1 of the Mythic Content Overhaul has arrived! Here are all the details, as well as a couple of changes since our original announcement. Gemstones and Prestige Points are combining into a single new currency that never expires: Mythic Essence! Mythic Essence—ME for short—can be obtained everywhere Gemstones or Prestige Points were previously earned. You can spend Mythic Essence in the Mythic Shop for special skins, accessories, and more. The new Mythic Shop features content that rotates on a regular basis, including the return of past Prestige skins! Mythic skins and accessories in the Mythic Shop will rotate every three months (every 6 patches). New Mythic skins debut at 100 ME and will cost 125 ME in future unvaults. Legacy Mythic skins that were once purchasable via Gemstones (such as Hextech Annie, Soulstealer Vayne, etc.) will also be available in the shop and cost 100 ME on first unvault, and 125 ME on future ones. Here's what's on offer for this patch rotation, as well as other options that will be available year-round. Prestige skins can only appear in the Mythic Shop at least one year after their original release. They'll cost 125 ME the first time they're offered in the Mythic Shop, 150 ME on the second, and 200 ME if they've been unvaulted three or more times.* Usually two Prestige skins will be unvaulted at a time and will be available in the Mythic Shop for one month (2 patches). However, to celebrate the new shop's launch, we're unvaulting six Prestige skins that will be available for three months (6 patches)! To recognize the higher investment required to obtain Prestige skins in 2018 and 2019, players who owned these skins before patch 12.5 will receive additional, exclusive 2022 editions of these skins. Commemorative Prestige skins will never be available via shops, loot, or rerolls. The following skins will be gradually distributed to original owners over the next month: To highlight the release of new Mythic and Prestige skins, limited edition loading screen borders and summoner icons can now only be obtained by purchasing the skin in the Mythic Shop or event Token Shop during the skin's initial debut period. Once a Mythic or Prestige skin is no longer available in these shops, it will be added to the regular loot drop and skin shard reroll pools without the limited edition loading screen border and summoner icon. This means that Mythic and Prestige skins can still be obtained via loot drops or skin rerolls but only AFTER their debut period ends, and WITHOUT their matching borders and icons. All of the above announcements are just Phase 1 of the Mythic Content Overhaul! While we're not launching Phase 2 just yet, we do have one big update to share regarding Showcase and Masterwork Milestones, which are reward tracks that will replace much of what was offered through Prestige Points in the past. We've adjusted our plans for Showcase Milestones, and Prestige skins that debut during Showcases will be available for purchase in the Mythic Shop for 125 ME rather than as the final reward of a Showcase Milestone track! Once the Showcase ends, the Prestige skin will immediately retire from the Mythic Shop and become available via loot drops and rerolls without its border and icon, just like other vaulted Prestige skins. We'll be adjusting the Showcase milestone rewards track to accommodate this update. And last but not least, don't forget—there's also a Phase 3 of the Mythic Content Overhaul! Stay tuned for more details later this year. Unrelated to the above, we're removing the ability to activate loot shards to rent champions, skins, and ward skins for 7 days. Virtually no one used the rental system; many players didn't even know it existed (heh). Any rentals that are currently active will still stay active for their remaining duration. The ability to upgrade shards into permanents, reroll them into permanents, or disenchant them into essence is not affected by any of these changes. Team formation for the second weekend of the Freljord Cup starts on March 28, and the tournaments will be on April 2 and 3."
12.7,2022-04-12,"You’ll never see it coming, it's patch 12.7! In this round of patch notes you may notice that some of our changes explicitly mention pro play. This is because MSI is right around the corner and is set to be played on patch 12.8! We’re aiming to shake up the meta a bit to allow for some more diverse picks in 12.7 and 12.8, but we’re introducing some spicier changes in 12.7 so that we can make additional adjustments in 12.8 if needed. In this edition of patch notes, we’re buffing some underpowered champs like Pantheon and Wukong, dropping some nerfs on stronger items like Galeforce and Winter’s Approach, and releasing some out-of-this-world Arcana skins! MSI isn’t the only pro play happening soon. You can catch the TFT patch notes here, where we’ll be going over the patch that Worlds will be played on! Gangplank is arrrguably struggling at all levels of play. He's already got enough gunpowder in his Q and barrels, so we're putting some power into less explosive and more… orange… parts of his kit. Gwen's been hanging by a thread after her most recent nerfs, so we're stitching her up with some cooldown buffs that should help her across all skill levels. Needle-ss to say, we don't think these changes will fully address her issues, but we're being extra careful considering her pattern of dominating Pro. Jayce has also been a popular pick in Pro. We're lowering his laning power by making him squishier early on, but increasing his growth to make sure he still scales to late game. Kalista hasn’t been seen often in Pro this season, and is generally weak in all levels of play. We're buffing some of her baseline stats which should especially help her out in Average play. Super speedy spooky spears incoming. While the Deathsinger remains powerful in bot lane, his voice has been faltering in the jungle. We're amping up his clear strength to bring jungle Karthus back from the dead. We're looking (no pun intended) to bring down Lee Sin's jungle clear speed and early game threat in order to reduce his impact on Pro play. We're targeting his base damage instead of his cooldowns to ensure his passive's rhythm remains the same. We're giving Lillia some more scaling sustain with her AP builds while also boosting her early jungle clear. These buffs should give her W damage a bit more oomph—or rather, eep! Neeko's been hidden from Pro play despite being a strong tomato in solo queue. Her on-hit build was quite popular in past metas, so we're bringing it back to lure the Curious Chameleon out of hiding! Pantheon hasn't been living up to his Spartan spirit, so we're sharpening his spear to make him feel more like the paragon of Rakkor warriors. Skilled Pantheon players should now be able to showcase their strength with more timely ults, more maneuverable shields, and better trading tools. Rengar's become a serious destroyer of furniture structures after his most recent changes. This is a new and flexible strength in his kit that we want to preserve, but he's taking down those (scratching) towers a bit too fast, so we're tapping down the damage on that part of his Q. We're also bumping up his damage against monsters to compensate for some of the clear speed he lost because of the changes to Q against plants last patch. Ryze's tank builds make him a safe yet potent split pusher by allowing him to stack health while dealing carry levels of damage, making him particularly lethal in Pro play. The mid-patch 12.5 nerfs didn't quite do the job at refining his hypercarry identity, so we're shifting his mana scaling to incentivize him to build a few more AP items before stacking health items like Winter’s Approach (which will also be receiving nerfs this patch) . Wukong hasn't been seen in Pro much despite having a theoretically good matchup into meta staples like Jayce and Graves. We're helping him claim his place in top lane while also reinvigorating jungle Wu so he can be a viable counter or flex pick. Despite my match history, Yasuo and Yone have been relatively weak (and the sustain nerfs in 12.6 didn’t do them any favors either). Rather than increasing their damage, we're giving the wind brothers more opportunity to flex their skills. For Yasuo, we're increasing his early combat durability and ability to synergize with teammates during laning phase. Yone is also getting more access to his ult, but with a focus on late game which is when it's usually harder for him to close gaps (unless he's already extremely far ahead). Zeri, Zeri, you’ve been a little too unfair-y. Despite the nerfs in previous patches, Zeri has been shockingly resilient and continues to dominate Pro play. With this round of nerfs, we’re aiming to bring her bruiser build more in line with her crit build, as well as make her stacks and on-hits more predictable. This should give enemies more time to catch Zeri before she starts zipping circles around them. Abyssal Mask has taken a back seat to Force of Nature in terms of magic resist options this season. We’re buffing Abyssal Mask’s passive, Unmake, to help it stand out as an aggressive tank option which will help unmake your enemies’ MR. Galeforce has been the go-to marksman mythic for a while now and has made hypercarries like Jinx and Aphelios a bit too safe in Pro play. We’re increasing Galeforce’s active cooldown to give opponents larger windows to punish scaling marksmen before they reach their endgame. Moonstone has been eclipsing the other enchanter support options. It offers a little too much sustain with relatively little risk, so we’re tuning down the bonus shields and heals to bring it in line with other enchanter mythic items. Umbral Glaive hasn’t been living up to its fantasy of blacking out opponents’ maps. We’re implementing some buffs to make it a better option for supports building lethality and roaming assassins looking to be a tad sneakier. Winter may be over for those of us in the Northern Hemisphere, but Winter’s Approach is still the premier choice for mana tanks and a few mages, despite being a scaling item. We’re increasing its cost to make it less appealing as a first purchase. Time Warp Tonic provides its users too much safety versus divers. Combined with the generic sustain power of Corrupting Potion, this often means ranged champions that want to play safe… always stay safe. We’re diluting the tonic a bit by taking out some of its special safety syrup, making it easier to punish. We have some smaller VFX updates for Leona’s base and older skins to help modernize the Radiant Dawn. We also have a complete VFX overhaul to improve Orianna's gameplay clarity and modernize her base and older skins. Lastly, we've also got a complete VFX overhaul of Shaco! (Does this count as Shaco lore?) Hot on the heels of last patch's Phase 1 launch, we're heading into Phase 2 of the Mythic Content Overhaul! This patch, we're introducing an infinitely repeatable rewards track for Masterwork Chests. Any Masterwork Chest you open grants progress on the rewards track, regardless of whether you bought it, earned it as a reward, or received it as a gift. In addition, since we've adjusted random Mythic Essence drops from Masterwork chests from 10 ME to 5 ME, we won't revert last patch’s buff to ME—it'll remain at a 4.2% drop rate. We're also introducing two adjustments to the Masterwork system relative to our original plan. Our original model would've led to Masterwork Chests granting more Mythic Essence than the new system has been tuned to support, and we felt it'd be better to do these changes now rather than later. We'll be following up soon with the other half of Phase 2, our first Showcase Milestone release! Get ready, because the second Split of Ranked begins on Friday, April 22 at 11:59 p.m. local time for your region! The exclusive rewards for Split 2 are a Renata Glasc summoner icon, Renata Glasc emotes, 1 Renata Glasc Champion permanent, and a Series 1 Eternals Capsule. Team formation for the Clash Piltover Cup begins on April 11, and the tournament begins on April 16 and 17! Team formation for week 2 of the cup will start on April 25 with the tournament days being April 30 and May 1."
12.8,2022-04-26,"MSI! MSI! Yup, you heard that right. This is the patch that the Mid-Season Invitational 2022 will be played on, starting on May 10th! We have a diverse mix of champion buffs and nerfs to set the global stage, along with the long-awaited Swain midscope update. Keep reading for more news on the Mythic Content as well, including Showcase Milestones—just in time for Prestige Lunar Eclipse Senna and all the other Solar & Lunar Eclipse Knights. And last but not least, we've also got a couple o' scallywag stragglers aboard the latest set of skins. Who will you be rooting for next month? Check out the light changes coming to TFT in the patch notes here as competitors hone their skills for the G&G Championship starting on the 29th! The Grand General is back and grander than ever. Swain has certainly made a name for himself in bot lane since his last mini rework, but as the commander of the Noxian front lines, he should also be one to strike fear in his solo lane enemies' hearts. The goal for this midscope update was thus to revive his fantasy as a master strategist and dark, demonic diplomat, rather than someone who must rely on others to execute his plans. In addition to mana buffs across all his abilities, of note are some changes to his crowd control capabilities. Swain can no longer pull enemies CC'd by allies, but his E now lets him pull everyone he snares, making him all the more terrifying in bottlenecks and narrow corridors. Together, these changes should help Swain players in all roles feel like the ruthless yet tactical ruler he is—especially when he unleashes Demonic Ascension, which now lasts for as long as Swain can sustain himself with his enemies' souls. Sacrifices must be made. The Wandering Caretaker has to do too much caretaking before he gets to do any wandering these days. This should make it easier for him to help his partner out while also incentivizing him to abandon lane roam around the map. Ezreal's been on the fringe of power in both solo queue and competitive play. We're giving him more access to his ult as the game goes on for those big high moments. Be careful where you recall... Fiddlesticks is often grasping at straws by midgame lately. We're increasing the scarecrow's survivability by boosting its(?) W, which becomes less impactful as a defensive tool as the game goes on. For someone who loves to put on a show, Jhin hasn't been performing all that well. We're giving him more power to set the stage, especially when he catches someone stepping out of place. We're also helping him clear camps faster with his W and E so we can get Jhingle to a 44.44% winrate. ;) Jinx has reigned supreme in bot lane all season long. Instead of putting a damper on her late game havoc, we're reopening her vulnerability to getting all-inned early. AP Kai'Sa today likes to burst her enemies down by spamming W from afar. (Sorry, ARAM players.) We're looking to move her away from that pattern and instead play more around single pops of her passive, which should still feel distinct from her AD builds that usually rely on attack speed and repeated passive procs. This should help all of her stats feel rewarding as well as better align her playstyle with her identity, regardless of how she chooses to adapt. Since the nerf on his passive in 11.24b, Kassadin has been noticeably weak. We're re-emphasizing his strength as the counter-mage mage by buffing his active abilities rather than his always-on passive. Mordekaiser has also been struggling to find his footing in top lane, so we're returning some of the Iron Revenant's move speed. This should help him stick to his enemies better. Get it? Like a magnet. Okay, we'll stop. We're fortifying both forms of Poppy's R so they feel more like ultimate-level abilities befitting a hero. More W uptime also means she can better control fights against those darned dashy champions—her number one specialty! Sejuani's strength is supposed to be in her ruthless engage capabilities, but her fearsome entrances are too often thwarted by individual poke or shorter fights later in the game. This should help her and Bristle recover faster and show up in all their Iceborn glory. We're doing a straightforward tap down on Soraka's mid to late game healing which is very high right now—especially in longer engagements where she can spam her W. Sylas has been a bit weak at all levels of play, so it's time to loosen his chains. Rather than buffing his lane, we're giving him more access to the most exciting and creative part of his kit, which should also make him better as a counterpick. Tristana's lost her scaling identity over time. We're returning some power to her late game, which should also make her less reliant on blasting all-in with Hail of Blades for an early snowball start. Vel'Koz has been pretty weak, so we're giving him a bigger reward for hitting those calculated skillshots. This should help him ""research"" his opponents more effectively in mid lane (or steal more kills as a support, hehe). Vladimir has been missing from both Pro play and top lane for some time, yet has remained fairly powerful for most players in mid. Boosting his durability early should let him brawl and sustain more effectively against melee fighters. Xayah's lethality build has risen to dominance in both Pro and solo queue, and its poke patterns unfortunately don't offer much counterplay in lane. Since those builds tend to max Q first, we're hitting its rankup incentives to make lethality Xayah a little less appealing. The Magus Ascendant has been descending throughout all of Season 2022. Even though he's supposed to be at his weakest when his enemies manage to get close, his current stun window is a little too short for him to get a chance at escaping. We're upping the duration at all distances so that he has an opportunity to get to an optimal range, as well as to make it more satisfying when he snipes from afar. Zoe may actually be very very old, but she often doesn't outgrow mana issues like other mages do. Since she tends to build full damage and doesn't synergize well with Tear, we're helping her out by reducing her mana costs. This should especially help her waveclear after lane phase, which requires lots and lots of Qs as the game progresses. Being able to use Stopwatch in addition to having its terminal items can lead to some pretty jarring game states and all around awkward moments, so we're removing that optimization. Like Masterwork Milestones last patch, Showcase Milestones grant bonus rewards for purchasing event capsules, though the Showcase Milestone track can only be completed once. We've made significant changes to Showcase Milestones since they were originally announced! Showcase Milestones are now the best way to collect content from new Showcase releases. We won't document Showcase Milestone tracks in patch notes moving forward, but since this is the first one it's worth walking through how the system works. To celebrate the occasion, the rewards for Eclipse Knights are a little sweeter than what future showcases will have on offer. Prestige Lunar Eclipse Senna will be available in the Mythic Shop for 125 ME for the duration of the Eclipse Knights Showcase. (Conveniently, completing the Eclipse 2022 Showcase Milestone track grants 125 ME.) After that, she'll be unavailable for direct ME purchase but will be added to loot drop and reroll pools without her debut loading screen border. Our pre-launch tuning adjustments to Masterwork Milestones slightly undershot longterm Mythic Essence rates. We buffed the final milestone reward a few hours after activation last patch and are documenting it here for visibility. We're also shipping a couple more things this patch to make up for missing the mark. Team formation for the second weekend of Piltover Clash began on April 25, and the tournaments will be on April 30 and May 1."
12.9,2022-05-10,"NEW CHALLENGES APPROACH! It’s time for patch 12.9, and with it the launch of our brand new Challenges system. Complete them to prove that you really are the best of the best!

No matter how you play, there's a Challenge for you. Learn more about how Challenges work in our full rundown. Despite Olaf’s popularity in Pro, he’s been one of the least mained champions in League for a while now. The flexibility of Ragnarok as an engage or escape and his fast clear speeds make him the ultimate example of a champ that walks the fine line between OP in Pro and “...meh” in all other levels of play. With this mid-scope update, we’re aiming to shift some of his power away from his clear speed and into tools that will help players feel stronger and in more control of Olaf’s survivability as he rides the edge of disaster at low health. These changes should not only help better define Olaf’s identity as a Berserker, but also allow him to take a new place as a viable top laner. Get ready to rock and roam because the one and only Stoneweaver is ready to rumble (the ground). Taliyah has been struggling to find footing on the Rift, not only in mid, but in the jungle as well—not to mention the mechanical complexity and punishing nature of her kit. For Taliyah’s update, we really wanted to focus on making her more fun (especially for players who’ve been playing her frequently), reviving her presence in mid, and increasing the amount of forgiveness in her kit. We’re hoping these changes shake things up and give her a clean slate to start anew! Ahri's been getting a lot of play time since her update. She's incredibly consistent at making picks and assassinating carries, all while remaining relatively safe and just out of reach. We're lowering the uptime on her CC and dashes to add more thrill to the chase. Everyone’s favorite Poro Protector has been feeling a little left out in the cold recently. We’re hoping to bring a smile back to his glorious mustache (and his poros’ faces) by beefing up his protective power. Hecarim is hecc'in weak after the last set of nerfs targeted at his tank build. We're helping him get his hooves back in the game (while being careful to avoid reintroducing his one-shot E build) by buffing his item scaling and increasing the horsepower behind his key survivability skill to more evenly distribute his power across his kit. These should help Hecarim find a more stable place in today’s meta without turning him into a pseudo-assassin race horse. The Wuju Bladesman has gotten a little too fast at killing his enemies, especially in late game. We're reducing his DPS scaling to slow him down and give his foes a chance to keep up. Nidalee's been catching prey left and right with her recently increased spell output, especially at higher levels of play. We're bringing down her early dueling power so she doesn't get such an easy Nida…lead. Pyke's been a little bone skewed toward mid ever since his changes long ago in Season 9, so we're reverting them to bring the Bloodwater Ripper back to bot lane. We're also adjusting some other parts of his kit to further tune him toward the unconventional support he is. Kills (and bags) secured. Renata Glasc is on her way to monopolizing bot lane at all levels of play, and business is really starting to boom in Elite. She's been getting a bit too much value prop out of her passive, whereas her return on investment for damage-oriented support items has been relatively low. These small adjustments toward AP item scaling should help balance and diversify her build portfolio. Renekton has largely disappeared from Pro after the fighter item changes in 12.3. We're looking to add some scaling back so he feels a bit better as the game progresses. We're also reducing the gap between his W and E second max builds since that choice leads to some serious win rate losses in Average play. You heard it here first, crocs are back in fashion. Rengar’s changes in 12.7 helped this kitty adapt a little too well to the outdoors to the point where he’s now the top cat in the jungle. We're reverting a buff to his clear (and that buff only) to otherwise leave him as is. We’re introducing some small quality of life changes and a batch of bugfixes to help fan Shyvana’s flames. Sion's been a bit too glorious in death. Although ""inting Sion"" had a good run, we believe it isn't a sustainable direction for him or League in the long term. Taking down towers by split pushing should certainly be doable even while behind, but when the strat requires repeatedly dying, it’s not very fun for all parties involved. We're nerfing undead Sion's split pushing power in order to restore some balance to his circle of life. What is the value of a soul? (Currently, not very much… ) Thresh has fallen off quite a bit, particularly in Average and Skilled play, so we're increasing his scaling power by making it more worthwhile to collect the essence of the dead. Gotta catch 'em all. Varus has been relatively weak since his Lethality nerfs last season. We're buffing his on-hit builds back up to make his vengeance viable again. Hullbreaker is an important tool for empowering split pushing, but when rushed as a first item, its bounty-ful bonus resists can invalidate laning and lead to unpleasant experiences. We still think it's a valuable addition to the game since, unlike past split push items like Zz'Rot, Hullbreaker requires champions to stay in the lane they’re split pushing. So we're nerfing its early game potency. MSI 2022 is here, and so are the MSI-themed Clash tournaments! Team formation for the Clash MSI Cup started on May 9, and the tournament begins on May 14 and 15! Team formation for week 2 of the Cup will start on May 16 with the tournament days being May 21 and 22!

12.10,2022-05-24,"Have no fear, the Champion Durability Update is here! This patch is a doozy, y'all. We've been working on a sweeping set of changes to increase champion durability across the board. So, unlike other patches that typically focus on balance via individual tweaks, 12.10 is all about evenly increasing durability overall (and nerfing related systems accordingly, like heals, shields, and sustain). You can expect to see longer fights throughout the game, more effort required to burst down your foes, and bigger windows of opportunity for skill expression. Read on for the details, and check out the most recent Quick Gameplay Thoughts for even more context! We expect this patch will shift the meta quite a bit, but as always, we'll keep an eye out for any critical follow-up needed. GLHF! Over in TFT, you can catch the last patch of Gizmos & Gadgets over in the TFT patch notes here!, as Dragonlands takes flight in just two weeks with patch 12.11! We've approached this first set of adjustments to the Durability Update by looking at champions who have fallen outside of our usual winrate bounds as well as those who've changed disproportionately since patch release. Our initial observations: As expected, many champions with significant heals/shields in their kit were hit by the systemic nerfs to heals/shields. We're following up on the ones that were nerfed by the broad pass a bit too hard by partially reverting as needed. Also unsurprisingly, late game scalers and damage-over-time champions have jumped quite a bit, but to what extent each champion would change was harder to predict. Note that this mid-patch update only addresses the most urgent outliers. We’re still monitoring the data as all of you get more games in, so expect more changes to come in patch 12.11. All champions will receive the following Durability Base Stat Package. A big takeaway here is that our goal is NOT to nerf sustain. Since each champion utilizes sustain differently, some will be stronger with the update and others weaker. That said, we’ll be keeping a very close eye on these changes as they roll out and making adjustments where needed. Since increasing durability means that heals, shields, and sustain will matter more to everyone, we're nerfing these systems accordingly with approximately equal weight. On a similar note, we’re also nerfing Grievous Wounds this patch in order to keep it in balance with healing so that its power will be roughly the same as before. These changes apply to all parts of the game, including champions, items, runes, Summoner Spells, and objectives. With these updates, you can expect fights to last a little longer. The goal is not to make games longer, but rather to nerf a few systems (Sunfire Aegis, Moonstone Renewer, Demonic Embrace, and Conditioning) that could dominate the game if left unchecked (League of Cleavers anyone?). We don’t want to pre-nerf potentially OP champions for this patch, but we’re confident these systems would warp item and rune choices if left unchecked. Because today’s update touches *checks notes* almost every single champion in League, we’re going to spare our mental and won’t write context for every single champ. That being said, in addition to the durability update, we have a few unrelated QoL follow-ups for Swain's recent rework. So skip ahead for your favorite bird tactician. (Re)calling all honorable players! A new Honor recall VFX is now available for you to show off in-game and will automatically apply to the following: The Challenger recall animation has also been updated! If you're eligible for both, the Challenger recall VFX will take precedence over the Honor recall. You can now block players in the Friend Request popup. (Yes, no more unwanted spam requests!) In patch 12.10, we'll be testing a change to duo queue around Apex Tiers for KR and NA regions only. Having a premade duo is a slight advantage, and while current Apex Tier players aren’t able to duo with anyone, the system only works off current rank. With this change, we’re tightening up the Apex Tier restriction to apply to MMR as well. The goal of this is to prevent climbing smurfs from being able to duo queue into Apex tier. That said, decayed Apex Tier players and the highest skilled Diamond I players may also be impacted by this change. Up until now these players could duo and reliably get into Apex Tier games, which isn't fair when the people they're playing against can't duo. If this change works as expected, we'll evaluate shipping it to the rest of the world with plans to re-evaluate before Season Start."
12.11,2022-06-07,"The Lavender Sea continues to grow, and with it, Bel'Veth descends upon the Rift to claim it as her own. Join Bel'Veth, the Void Empress, this patch! The numbers are in and… champions are now more durable! After the sweeping changes we introduced in the last patch, this week we're on cleanup duty to restore balance to the Rift. Two big things to keep in mind here. First of all, we don’t want to over nerf/buff any champions as an immediate response to the Durability Update. We’re avoiding this by considering each champs’ individual strengths and weaknesses relative to their overall class/role balance and preferred itemization choices. Second, since the 12.10 healing and shielding nerfs were done across the board, they ended up affecting some champs more than others. This round, we’re going through champs individually and returning heal and shielding power where needed, or reinvesting that lost power into other aspects of their kit. In other news, we also have the brand new Ocean Song skin line releasing this patch and with it Prestige Ocean Song Seraphine for a limited time. (Before you ask, no, the Ocean they're in isn't the same as Bel'Veth's Lavender one.) TFT: Dragonlands takes flight this patch, sending Pengu and friends to a new set in a world of islands diverse in ecology and combat strategy. Check out the new set mechanics, traits, champions, and more, in the TFT patch notes here! Join the Lavender Sea on June 9! Aphelios has been very weak this patch, and he didn’t get much help from the Durability Update. We're buffing up his passive to help add a little more fire moon power to his guns. Brand has been on fire since the Durability Update given that everyone having more HP increases the value of his abilities. We're partially extinguishing his ability to burn his enemies with percent max health damage. Cait wasn't in a great place pre-12.10, and her lane bully reputation has only continued to suffer with the update. We're putting more power in her Piltover Peacemaker to help her procure her proper place pressuring preposterous people (lane opponents). The Tidal Trickster has been keeping his head above water, but his big mana costs feel pretty bad in extended combat. We're giving him more to work with later in the game, but also bringing down his tankiness so he doesn't get too playful out there. Gragas hasn't been keeping up with the extended fights that came with the Durability Update, so we're topping off his Graggy Ice by giving him some more drinking power and agility to help his rotations in longer skirmishes. Gwen's been the most dominant top laner in Pro thanks to her high resilience, mobility, and damage. In particular, with longer fight durations, she's more often able to cast Hallowed Mist twice, so we're increasing the cooldown of her incredibly powerful teamfight tool. We're also reverting the E change from 12.7 which was giving her dash more uptime in fights than intended. The Durability Update didn't do our Blade Dancer any favors, greatly reducing her potential to get kills in the early game. While this was intended, she is a bit weaker than we’d like so we're giving her a small sustain boost and more opportunities to stun opponents to help her out in ways that aren’t burst damage. Better nerf buff Irelia. Darkin Kayn has been reaping quite a lot of benefits from the Durability Update, with all these champions walking around with more health and whatnot. Pulling some power from his Q to help him find balance post-12.10. Our little Void puppy has started baring his fangs (oddly enough, they look a lot like Guinsoo's Rageblade). Given his knack for gnawing through his chew toys and enemies in longer team fights, we're head patting down his percent health damage and attack speed. Lee Sin has been struggling to consistently snowball his early leads since the Durability Update, so we're rolling back some nerfs implemented in 12.7 to help him find his footing again. Much like Brand and Kayn, Lillia's abilities that deal percent max health damage were indirectly buffed by the Durability Update. We're toning down the areas that benefited most to make her a little less of a nightmare this patch. It turns out that when a tanky champion can deal true damage, it's a little strong. We're taking down Yi's durability and true damage, which both greatly benefited from the Durability Update. Nunu has been a burst reliant tank, and his nerfs in patch 12.10 negatively affected both his burstiness and his tankiness. We like him being slightly less lethal, but in exchange we’re giving him some additional durability to offset the reduced damage. Also you can now throw more snowballs per game. Like a LOT more snowballs. Snowball fight anyone? With the combination of the Durability Update and his mid-scope, Olaf was living up to his berserker fantasy a little too much, especially up in top lane. We're pulling back on some of his bonus stats and making him less tanky late game in exchange for more jungle clear efficiency to give jungle Olafs some needed help. Rakan was hit pretty hard by the Durability Update given his heavy use of shields and his reliance on getting takedowns with his CC (something much harder with more durable champs). We're giving him back what he lost plus a little more in hopes he can make a Grand Entrance back onto the Rift. Rengar has been finding a lot of success with his lethality and fighter builds recently, especially in Elite tiers of play. We’re giving him some more generalized nerfs for now while we keep an eye on how his builds and itemization choices land this patch. We're loosening up some of Ryze's mana restrictions so his spellcasting is a little more forgiving while he's scaling up. We understand that this isn’t going to resolve all of the issues he’s currently facing, but this should help make him a little less blue while we look into new ways to make Ryze feel good in solo queue without dominating pro play. Since the Durability Update, Samira has been struggling to find those explosive leads and snowball opportunities. We're increasing her scaling a bit so she's got more potential to style on her enemies in later stages of the game. Senna has been a bit too strong with the Durability Update, consistently winning lane and oppressing her opponents. We're taking down her power as a support and, in exchange, giving ADC Senna more chances to collect Mist Wraiths. Turns out Swain's new empire was Patch 12.10, quickly rising to power in every lane. We're nerfing him across the board with particular attention to Top and Mid, making his healing and damage lower at later stages of the game. With the Durability Update, Sylas has found himself unable to burst down opponents like he used to. While his burst has been nerfed, we actually aren’t planning on buffing it back to what it once was. Instead we want to give him back power in other meaningful ways. For now, we're buffing his versatility so he can find more ways to fight the system. UNBENCHED. UNLOADED. UNCLOGGED. The Durability Update wasn't particularly nice to Tahm in any of his roles, so we're granting this fish's wishes by giving him some compensatory buffs to his heals and shields which should help him stick around longer in extended fights. Taliyah's mid-scope update in Patch 12.9 was great for Taliyah players, especially those in Elite tiers of play. We're introducing some Elite-skewed nerfs that should erode some of her power as well as some QoL changes and bug fixes to help her out. Taric hasn’t been the radiant gem he once was, so we’re giving him some large buffs that should help him thrive in extended combat situations to help him shine in the new meta. Tryndamere took a big tumble in patch 12.10. His healing from Fury comes at a high cost so we're reverting the pre-emptive healing nerfs we gave him in patch 12.10 while giving his ultimate more up time in games. We're targeting Veigar's level scaling by limiting access on his E. This should bring his team fight control back to reasonable heights, especially in late game after he gets some Ability Haste. Wukong was already quite powerful before, and the durability update pushed him over the edge. We're looking to nerf his jungle role through clear speed and tap down top a bit as well through early mobility. Xin Zhao doesn't pose as much of a threat to backline carries as he used to, so we're giving him a bit more damage on his fairest spell and returning some of his extended combat power. Zeri, Zeri, we've nerfed you so much you haven't been remotely scary. So this time around, we're giving you more damage to make you merry. That said, buffs come at a cost, and we're being wary, so we're lowering your utility and mobility, you electric carry. Despite the systemic nerf last patch, Grievous Wounds is still too impactful in the game, forcing us to push healing to unreasonable levels. We think GW itself should be a conscious choice that really shines against enemies with overwhelming amounts of healing, not just moderate amounts, since that detracts from more exciting items you can buy. So, we're nerfing GW itself a little bit more, but also compensating the items that apply it to keep them at roughly the same power level. These changes apply to all Grievous Wounds items below, as well as Grievous Wounds applied by abilities (Katarina, Kled, Singed, Varus, and Ignite). We're tuning AP Mythics with a holistic approach to bring their power levels closer together. In particular, Liandry's and Riftmaker both went up with the Durability Update thanks to longer combat times, while Everfrost has been strong for quite some time. Crown has been underwhelming even before and has become even less desirable with lower burst in 12.10. Lastly, Night Harvester has been underpicked by AP assassins and needed a little love. Tanks as a whole have been struggling after the Durability Update. Since everyone's gotten tankier, the tank class's main advantage has been nerfed (relatively speaking) whereas their already low damage is even less threatening than before. We're increasing the health on their Mythics to form the foundation for higher resists on their primary Legendaries, and buffing a few Legendaries as well. Death's Dance and Maw of Malmortius have been hot topics even before the Durability Update. We wanted to see where they would land post-update before touching them and, seeing that they're still too powerful, we're tapping down on them a bit. On the other hand, BoRK fell off a bit, though not quite as much as Sterak's, so they're receiving buffs accordingly. Lastly, Goredrinker needed a bit of a boost, so we're increasing its Ability Haste scaling to give it more power in extended combat. Kraken Slayer has naturally gone up with extended combat times, so we're tapping down on its third-stack bonus, too. Unrelated to the Durability Update, Umbral Glaive's been giving a bit too much vision control, so we're reverting half of the cooldown buff from 12.7. First towers kinda SLAP right now. We overshot some of the early game damage buffs to towers in the update by a little bit, which has deterred some proactive and aggressive plays in early lane phase. We're toning them down so they aren't such super-safe havens for the scaling champs who have been thriving on 12.10. Team formation for the Clash Demacia Cup began on June 6, and the tournament begins on June 11 and 12! Team formation for week 2 of the Cup will start on June 20 with the tournament days being June 25 and 26. End of Game chat is now opt-in!

12.12,2022-06-22,"Make snow mistake—it's patch 12.12! We're here with another set of balance changes, several of which are continued follow-ups to the 12.10 Durability Update. Certain heals and shields are getting further adjustments, while select burst and engage mechanics will receive the little extra oomph that they needed. Champion pets can have a little durability, too. This patch also brings back the Essence Emporium for a limited time. The Mythic Shop is also rotating for the first time ever, introducing Ashen Knight Pantheon and more. And oh, was that a chill in the air? The Snow Moon must be rising... Brrrr, cold nights can be rough. Good thing it's always warm and sunny in Dragonlands! Check out our first patch of the new set at the TFT patch notes here. Amumu support has all but disappeared after the heavy nerfs to his mana costs last season. We're reverting those and giving his ult more early power to help him find some friends in bot lane again. Annie's burst builds have fallen off since the Durability Update, especially at higher levels of play. We're making her combos a little more fire and giving Tibbers his own CDU (Cuddly Durability Update). The Empress of the Void is reigning with a bit too much terror in lower and average skill brackets. These nerfs should reduce her strength in lower levels of play to a more stable win rate across the board. A few visual updates have also been made to Bel'Veth's true form based on player feedback! Blitzcrank's engage capabilities have gathered some rust since the Durability Update. We’re making his hooks hurt more so they feel as rewarding to land as they should. Mundo's malpractice was already doing well, but now that Grievous Wound is weaker, it's time we check his medical license. We're nerfing him overall by lowering his healing, but the larger chunk of health missing should make his fantasy really come alive when he injects his maximum dosage. Since the Durability Update, Fiora has become extra punishing in Elite play where players who can consistently strike Vitals deal massive max health true damage. We're toning her passive down as a result, which will also reduce her ult's power. Heimerdinger's inventions have fallen short lately. Boosting his turrets' health and firepower to match the Durability Update is sure to be a formula for success! The Durability Update wasn't so friendly to our friend of the forest. These buffs should return some of his early gank power by a lot. Oh, and Daisy gets a base stat gift, too! Janna is still too strong across the board. Her biggest vulnerability should be when she gets caught, so we're nerfing her wind speed and defensive spells to make her easier to punish. Jarvan IV wasn't the hardest hit by the Durability update, but his sustained damage output hasn't been left unscathed. We're letting him get a few more rotations in now that bursting enemies has gotten much harder, Bruiser and tank builds shouldn't work well on someone like Katarina, a hyper-mobile resetting assassin. We're making some slight adjustments to discourage only those itemizations. Lucian's been shining in Pro bot lanes since before MSI and has continued to do so, even after the Durability Update. We're tapping down his strong early damage so the Sentinel of Light isn’t so blinding in lane. Seraphine hasn't been making soundwaves, so we're boosting her CC to help her captivate her enemies. Shaco's been struggling in a world with more durable playthings, especially with his traditional burstier builds. He already has quite a bit of survivability with his tricks, so we're trading some of his durability for more burst. This should open up those high-risk, high-reward builds once again, adding to his diverse itemization options. (As a reminder, his Q and E can deal additional damage with his Passive - Backstab bonus.) Singed mid has always been quite strong, but the recent systemic changes have thrown him just over the edge into OP territory. We're nerfing his early run-at-you power so his squishier lane opponents have a chance to escape (or at least fight back). We buffed Soraka's ult back in 11.18, letting it remove Grievous Wounds to give her some hope against the 60% reduced healing effect. Now that GW is weaker, we're okay with letting it serve its original purpose. Viego's been sitting on the jungle throne for a little too long, especially in Pro play. We're curbing the king's reset potential and giving laners more opportunity to react to his ganks. Yorick's Mist Walkers and Maiden of the Mist are also getting a slight base stat package to help them keep up with the Durability Update. We're also adding a few tweaks to make Yorick's spectral army a bit more ghastly when positioned correctly. Namely, the Maiden won't wander too far when moving toward marked targets. As this chapter of the Durability Update comes to an end, Yuumi's heals are still a bit too strong right meow. Her power level at large isn't crossing the line, so we're just shifting some of it around. Zeri's W damage was a bit shocking with the crit multiplier, so we're nerfing that and compensating with a little regen boost. We're adding some ability haste into Night Harvester's build path to match its buff last patch. Serpent's Fang was reducing shields by a lot more than intended thanks to a bug. We expect the fix will lead to a nontrivial nerf, so we're calling it out here instead. On the contrary, Shadowflame was underperforming due to a different bug that mitigated its damage based on the very magic resistance it was supposed to ignore. This fix should actually result in a slight buff for the item. We're nerfing Predator's early power as it tends to really hurt some lanes before enemies get a reasonable chance at counterplay, and compensating its late game to even things out. The Essence Emporium returns from June 28 to July 12. Head to the store to use Blue Essence to nab chromas, ward skins, emotes, icons, and more, including Emporium exclusives like the URFWick skin! IMPORTANT: After this run, the Essence Emporium is going on hiatus while we rebuild it. Right now, running the Emporium is so inefficient it causes delays and feature cuts in other projects like events and missions. Beyond making the Emporium more efficient to run, we're also exploring navigation and usability improvements for when (not if) it returns. Be sure to spend all your Blue Essence during this Emporium! To make up for this hiatus, we're shifting the three Gemstone icon bundles into a chain of three missions (matchmade SR or ARAM). This will be free for all players, granting 10 Mythic Essence each for a total of 30. We're adding a new type of content to the Mythic Shop: Mythic Chromas, available for 40 Mythic Essence! The first Mythic Chroma is for Final Boss Veigar, available during patches 12.12 through 12.13. Mythic Chromas update a skin's VFX in addition to its model. They're launching for Legendary skins as well as Mythic skins like the Ashen Knights. (Ashen Knight Pyke and Ashen Knight Pantheon's Emberwoken chromas will receive updated VFX in patch 12.18.) The Mythic Shop is rotating for the first time and we're settling into the normal rotation cadence: Muting a player during Champ Select will now carry over to in-game and End of Game. (This also means that muting someone in-game will carry over to End of Game.) Additionally, individual players' mute status can now be viewed and toggled in the End of Game screen. Team formation for the second weekend of Demacia Clash starts on June 20, and the tournaments are on June 25 and 26. We've updated the way certain challenges detect which lane you play on Summoner’s Rift to be more accurate! We've also added the following new challenges."
12.13,2022-07-12,"Jump for joy—it’s patch 12.13! On this week’s episode of Patch Notes, we have the premiere of our newest champion (and Star Guardian) Nilah, the Joy Unbound! We also have the Star Guardians, new and old, making their appearance again to protect us from the forces of evil. Sivir’s mid-scope update also debuts this patch, not to mention your regularly scheduled balance adjustments. We interrupt your regularly scheduled patch notes to say a big goodbye to our patch note author ahrisoo, who is leaving on an adventure to become Dr. ahrisoo. Your patch notes (and patch jokes) will be missed! Read on to see if the true treasure of patch notes was the friends LP we made along the way. Speaking of stars, the TFT patch notes this week feature an update to Aurelion Sol, Double Up improvements, and more. Learn all about them here! Slip, slide, slash, and make a splash with Nilah on July 13! Sivir has been dethroned as the queen of late-game teamfights. Her short range meant she had to work twice as hard as other ADCs to do damage, which led to her opting for lethality builds instead of crit. While other marksmen have gained attack range over time, we are giving Sivir new tools that lean into her strengths as a close range, AoE DPS hyper carry that reward her for playing on the edge of danger. With this mid-scope update, we’re setting Sivir up to have the strongest AoE DPS output of all the marksmen—so long as she can stay alive to use it. We’re hoping Sivir players find that her damage potential is now much higher and more consistent due to the adjustments we’ve made to her Ricochet and signature Boomerang Blade. Ultimately, these should help shift Sivir's identity from a chauffeur for her teammates to a high damage AoE marksman with the added ability to help clean up winning fights. The Daring Bombardier doesn’t look up-to-snuff when launching missiles from a screen away. His long-ranged poke has made him a menace in Pro Play given how consistent and powerful it is. We’re toning down his missiles and upgrading his Gatling Gun so Corki has a bigger reason to enter close quarters combat. Elise is still building her web, trying to find a spot on the Rift post-Durability Update. We’re adding some more damage to her Q to help her assassinate slightly more durable targets and buffing up her base stats to bring her in line with other junglers. Evelynn hasn’t been seen much since the Durability Update, and not because she’s been using her camouflage. We’re (al)luring players into playing her again by giving her several quality of life buffs and increasing the reward for when she successfully charms her targets. For the living embodiment of fear, Fiddlesticks hasn’t been very scary as of late. We’re turning up the spook-factor by giving it some additional utility and damage to be a tad more terrifying. Galio’s tornadoes have been feeling more like a light breeze recently, but we don’t want to make him a full blown AP assassin. We’re putting some more wind beneath his wings to help him poke down opponents without fully committing in hopes he’ll take off soon. Gwen has been one of the premiere top laners since MSI, and the Durability Update only increased her strengths. Even after her nerfs in 12.11, she’s still a cut above the competition, especially when it comes to Pro Play. We’re snipping some power out of her Pro-skewed abilities like her E and W to patchwork it into some more accessible parts of her kit. These should net out in a nerf to Pro Gwen and a buff to her in Average and Skilled levels of play. Karthus has been struggling to live up to his battlemage fantasy recently, so we’re giving him some additional durability to clear camps more safely. This should also let him play a bit closer to fights so he can get the most out of his kit. Just not too close or you’ll be getting the most out of your passive. Kled’s been fulfilling his role as a lane bully quite well, but he hasn’t been able to capitalize on his advantages to be a terror outside of top. We’re buffing the Cantankerous Cavalier to help make him a bit more of a dangerous presence in the later stages of the game. Master Yi has always been a champ that is strong at lower levels of play, but not-so-great in higher skill brackets. We’ve been keeping our eyes on Yi after our last set of nerfs and now feel like we can give him some power back in a way that helps reduce this skew. Since Yi is pretty dependent on being durable in higher brackets of play, we’re giving him more ways to increase his survivability in fights. Olaf’s mid-scope update helped him establish his place in the top lane, but he hasn’t been as powerful in the jungle. We’re giving him some additional buffs that should help strengthen his jungler roots. With recent updates, it's been harder than ever for Renekton to scale into the mid and late game. His ultimate’s AoE damage in particular doesn’t feel as impactful, so we’re giving it an AD ratio to help this crocodile with his scale-ing. Taliyah hasn’t been as strong as we’d hoped after her previous tectonic power shifts from patch 12.11. We’re increasing the damage output on her Q to help both her overall laning and jungling in lower brackets of play plus giving her some quality of life buffs. Vex has been feeling extra gloomy now that she can’t burst opponents as easily. We’re adding some power back into her Mistral Bolt so she'll feel a little bit happier when she bursts her enemies (but she’d never tell anyone about it). Volibear has been much too strong recently, especially in the jungle. We’re pulling power away from some of his stronger jungling tools, like his reliable ganks and extra damage against high-health objectives like Baron and Dragon. We’re also lowering his damage across the board so he doesn’t do quite as much when he opts to itemize tank. Divine Sunderer is currently doing its job a bit too well. Not only is it helping fighters play into tanks, it’s also helping them play better into everyone in general. With this update, we’re looking to shift Sunderer’s power away from shredding tanks and into a comparatively lower damage/higher sustain option for fighters. We’re making some updates to the way the passive of Demonic Embrace and Liandry’s Anguish stack when applied by multiple users. Assassins are currently doing a balanced amount of damage with lethality items, but the class overall is just a tad weaker than we’d like. We’re taking a non-traditional approach to buffing assassins by adding bonus move speed to their Mythic iItems which should also help discourage bruiser or tank itemizations. We’re updating objective bounties to help make them feel more fair to players, whether they’re behind or ahead. When we created objective bounties the intention was for teams that are behind to be able to catch up in a difficult but not impossible way. However, when teams that are only a little behind claimed multiple bounties, they catapulted into the lead. We’re hoping these changes make claiming bounties as the lead starts closing more fair for both teams. Currently, if you dash or blink into a jungle monster or ward’s visible range, there’s a very brief delay before you gain vision of them. This can lead to some frustrating moments, so we’re changing that to be instantaneous. (On the other hand, losing vision of monsters and wards will continue to have a slight delay.) Ultimate Spellbook makes a return, but this time it’s Star Guardian themed. This iteration of Spellbook will include Star Guardian minions and Ahri as an announcer! We’ve also made some other non-Star Guardian related updates to this game mode: Team formation for the second weekend of Shadow Isles Clash starts on July 18, and the tournament days are on July 23 and 24. Adding Regional Transfer Rank Preservation. If you transfer your account out of a region and back to that region within two weeks, your account’s ranked state upon returning to your original region will be restored to what it was when you left. This is intended to curb some region-transfer rank abuse we’ve been seeing and also means you won’t have to re-do your ranked climb if you take your League account with you on a quick vacation."
12.14,2022-07-26,"It’s a Bird! It’s a plane! It’s a Star Guardian? Nope, it’s patch 12.14 bringing you your biweekly dose of gameplay changes and updates! This patch includes several healing targeted updates to bring League’s hyper healers (and their items) to justice. We’re also making some adjustments to drakes, Elder Dragon, and Rift Herald as well as a few runes and summoner spells. Lastly, we’re welcoming the second half of everyone’s favorite high school superheroes, the Star Guardians, to the Rift this patch! Fight on Star Guardians! Everyone nowadays is a high school superhero, but I'll tell you what, back in my day we had a handful of gold coins, and some powerful Dragons to buy. Speaking of, you can learn all about our changes in TFT: Dragonlands at the TFT patch notes here! With the Grievous Wounds nerf in patch 12.11 Aatrox’s life-stealing drain tanking has gotten a bit out of hand. We're shifting his power a bit by bringing down his overall healing in favor of increasing the Darkin's baseline durability. Compared to other melee supports, Alistar has been falling behind the herd. We're looking to increase the uptime of his Q - Pulverize so he can more often use a second Pulverize in fights—especially when he has his ultimate going. One of Gangplank's most defining features is his ability to turn the tides of a fight with late game barrel chains and critical strikes. However, getting to those late game power spikes shouldn't be smooth sailing. We're opting to weaken his laning phase by reducing his harass strength and making him a bit squishier early while maintaining incentives for him to itemize crit. Mini Gnar hasn't been quite as vulnerable during his laning phase as we'd like. We're looking to reduce his base health and health regeneration growth so that he's a bit more punishable at close range, similar to other ranged top laners. In this patch one of our objectives is to nerf overtuned healing and shielding champions and items. In an effort to bring healing systems back in line, we needed to take a little bit of the wind out of Janna’s sails since her shield and heal power stood out compared to the other item stats we’re updating this patch. Shifting her power more into her base heals and shield should help keep her more in line with her enchanter friends. Jarvan IV has been struggling in a world of extended combat duration and our last round of buffs in patch 12.12 didn’t aid the King as much as we had hoped. This time around we’re increasing his ability to make plays by increasing the uptime of his flag and drag combo. Red Kayn/Rhaast has been running rampant due to the Grievous Wounds nerfs in 12.11 leaving his healing unchecked. Like Aatrox, we're shifting his power by reducing his healing and increasing his base durability. LeBlanc has taken quite a hit after the Durability Update, unable to keep up with everyone's increased stats. We're looking to snap her back into reality by relaxing her ability's mana constraints and giving her more mana to poke her opponents down into her kill range. We’re giving Nocturne a small quality of life update so that he isn't punished by his passive when trying to tax last hit minions. Despite recent efforts to strengthen Pantheon in solo lanes he hasn’t been able to pick up much traction. Given that we’re in a slower, low kill meta, we’re reverting the changes made in patch 11.3 to help Pantheon make a grand starfall re-entrance into the jungle to help spice up the early game. Renata's corporate takeover of the bot lane has come to fruition recently, solidifying her place as a top support. That said, nothing lasts forever. We're taking Renata down a notch by lowering her base stats so she has to be a little more calculated when picking trades in the early game. Seraphine's taken center stage as a result of the Champion Durability Update and her recent buffs in 12.12. While she shines brightest as a bot carry, her mid and support performances are also extraordinary. In order to help tone her down we're reducing how effectively she can support allies when itemizing AP by decreasing her AP ratios. Sivir hit the jackpot with her mid-scope update and landed in a pretty strong spot, particularly in the waveclear department. We’re looking to tone down her ability to waveclear so effectively by reducing the amount of damage her W does to high health minions, but adding an execute so that she can still haul in the gold by last hitting effectively. After the Durability Update Teemo’s shrooms haven’t been hitting as hard as they once did. To help out the Swift Scout, we’re buffing his mushroom power and increasing his placement range in the early stages of the game. We’re also relaxing some of his mana restrictions, so that he’s gated by R’s cooldown instead of mana issues. Varus hasn't been hitting the mark in either Pro Play or Solo Queue, so we're giving him a straightforward buff that should help, regardless of whatever build he opts for. With the value of healing having gone up in the Durability Update, the value of Wukong's passive has gone up as well, especially in the later stages of the game. We're putting a stop to this monkey business by shifting his health regen from his passive to his base stats. This should result in his laning phase feeling roughly the same, but reduce his scaling regeneration a bit. Yuumi’s been having as much fun as a cat with a ball of yarn since the Durability Update. As one of League’s premier enchanters we’re dampening the amount of healing she can output to bring her more in line with other supports. Zeri's ability to win duels and wavepush due to her increased damage to low health enemies has made her unfair-y to her opponents. We're opting to preserve this mechanic as a tool to help her last hit minions, but eliminating its strengths when it comes to dealing with low health enemies more broadly. With our changes in patch 12.11, Chempunk Chainsword became an incredibly gold efficient item, even with its reduced Grievous Wounds effects. Instead of nerfing the item’s stats we’re opting to increase its cost to bring it more in line with other Legendary Fighter item options. Enchanters as a whole were the big winners of the Durability Update, even after the systematic nerfs we did to heal and shield power in 12.10. They’re harder to kill early, are buffing more durable targets, and benefit from weaker Grievous Wounds. We think there are a lot of beneficial aspects to having enchanters be more durable, but they’re currently much too effective at keeping allies and themselves alive come mid to late game. We’re nerfing all of their common items so that there are more opportunities to kill that out-of-position carry with an enchanter behind them. Sunfire Aegis has started to emerge as a powerful second item for DPS champions. While Fighters have dipped into other Tank items before, Sunfire offers the most stats and potent damage compared to other options. We're adjusting Sunfire so its damage output is more strongly tied to health stacking. After the Durability Update we’ve seen kills in the early game decrease substantially, especially in professional play. Overall, we believe that the amount of damage post-laning phase is in a good spot. However, it’s currently too difficult to create meaningful leads in lane due to the amount of strong defensive runes and potions. We’re opting to nerf these sustain options so that getting early advantages is a bit more achievable. With champions being more durable, the damage reduction aspect of Challenging Smite isn’t as necessary as it once was. Now that we’re giving junglers a bit more early game influence with the objective changes we’re looking to pull a bit of power out of this summoner spell. Exhaust has become a common summoner spell for marksmen recently, making it a bit too hard to all in and kill enchanter supports in the bot lane. We’re toning down its power to make it a bit less exhausting to play against. As mentioned above, early game is currently becoming much slower which has led to a meta shift focusing on scaling team comps. Players have become more comfortable conceding early objectives in order to reach their late game win conditions. In order to increase the priority of early game objectives we’re going to be increasing the reward for early drake and Rift Herald takes. Individual drake buffs are currently too low impact as players will more likely prioritize them due to the threat of soul and less for the individual buffs themselves. In order to make drake buffs more meaningful, we’ll be increasing the buff values of each by roughly 50% (and even more for Cloud Drake). In addition, we’ll be decreasing the damage output of drakes across the board in exchange for more durability so that teams have more time to contest drakes as a coordinated group. In a similar vein, we’re now increasing the value of Rift Herald by making Shelly drop local gold. We’re also increasing the amount of health on the second Herald to increase its value and priority relative to the first so that it's ignored less often. The following Ult-ernate Summoner Spells have been updated to match their original champion's functionality: Team formation for the first weekend of the Zaun Cup Clash starts on August 1, and the tournament days are on August 6 and 7. The Mythic Shop rotates this patch! This is a small rotation, meaning only the unvaulted Prestige skins and new Mythic Chroma are rotating. The next large rotation will be in patch 12.18."
12.15,2022-08-09,"If you wanna be the very best, catch all your patch changes (and Monster Tamers) here! In this week’s installment of Patch Notes we’re giving energy based champions a little boost, doing some follow-up fine tuning to Master Yi and Sivir, and buffing up some engage supports. We’re also tapping down Divine Sunderer and First Strike’s power so they aren’t always super effective. Now come with me, the time is right — it’s patch 12.15! Looking to go on adventures in a different realm? Well check out the TFT patch notes here! As a system, energy is intended to give champions spikes of power that fall off with extended combat times. Given the current state of the game and more extended fights, champions that use energy as a resource have found it more difficult to find success before their energy depletes (note: this section is repeated for energy users in this patch). In Akali’s case, we’re slightly increasing the amount of energy she gains from her shroud to help her squeeze in an additional ability or two per fight. Gwen’s changes in 12.13 achieved our goals of making it easier for players to lane with her and execute her combos, but they were a bit too effective at the highest levels of play. We intend to keep her identity as a powerful scaler, but we’re trimming just a bit of damage from her late game. Kalista has been dominating the bot lane in professional play recently as a powerful early game pick. We’re bringing down her damage a tad in order to make her a little less oppressive in the very early stages of the game. Our electric yordle doesn’t have the same energy issues as other champions being adjusted this patch, but has been struggling for entirely different reasons. Shocker. With more durable targets Kennen has found it difficult to establish himself as either a lane bully or a teamfight winner. We’re putting some more power into his teamfighting identity by increasing his ability to win fights with a slight boost to his W and R damage. As a system, energy is intended to give champions spikes of power that fall off with extended combat times. Given the current state of the game and more extended fights, champions that use energy as a resource have found it more difficult to find success before their energy depletes (note: this section is repeated for energy users in this patch). In Lee Sin’s case, we’re slightly decreasing the energy he needs so that he has a bit more leeway to recast his spells during combos. Engage supports are currently a bit weaker than where we’d like them to be post-Durability Update. Now that enemies are more likely to survive her engages, we’re giving her a little more power in extended fights and when she can successfully land her skill shots. Lillia’s been a bit weak in the jungle at all skill brackets. We’re giving her some jungle-oriented buffs that should help with her clear speed without her becoming a nightmare in the top lane. Master Yi has been doing pretty well with the last set of changes, achieving a relatively equal win rate across various skill levels of play. He’s still a bit stronger than we’d like him to be so we’re taking down his access to his E and true damage, especially in cases where Yi is opting to max E first. Qiyana’s been the empress of the Rift lately, partly due to a bug which allowed her to proc her passive twice with First Strike. We’ve removed that bug and are nerfing First Strike which should result in an overall nerf, but also taking a little bit of power out of her passive so that she’s a bit less oppressive. With the 12.14 changes to tank items, Rammus hasn’t been rollin’ around with the enthusiasm he once had. We’re opting to return some power to his kit with a few quality of life adjustments to his ultimate to which Rammus would respond by saying “OK.” As a system, energy is intended to give champions spikes of power that fall off with extended combat times. Given the current state of the game and more extended fights, champions that use energy as a resource have found it more difficult to find success before their energy depletes (note: this section is repeated for energy users in this patch). Shen is doing relatively okay in terms of energy efficiency, so we’re just giving him a tiny buff to help him in the late game. Now that the days of predator Singed mid are behind us, we’re reverting some changes we made to decrease his durability in patch 12.12 and buffing up his passive so that it feels better in teamfights. Now he’ll be able to zip around and flip his enemies to his Chem-infused heart’s content. Continuing work on Sivir’s midscope update, she’s successfully found her spot as a hyper-scaling AOE marksman on the roster. With this set of changes we’re looking to take away a little bit of her late game power and create more windows of opportunity for her opponents to challenge her. Taliyah’s Unraveled Earth is a great tool for stalling teamfights and creating a danger zone to scare off opponents. However, it’s currently creating a bit too much time for herself and allies. We’re taking down her ability to cast it quite as frequently, but she should still be able to use it twice or more in late game fights. Like other engage supports, Thresh has been struggling to capitalize on his ability to start fights which really takes the death out of Death Sentence. We’re lowering the cooldown and increasing the damage so that his hooks are a bit deadlier. As a system, energy is intended to give champions spikes of power that fall off with extended combat times. Given the current state of the game and more extended fights, champions that use energy as a resource have found it more difficult to find success before their energy depletes (note: this section is repeated for energy users in this patch). In Zed’s case, we’re lowering the energy cost on his E and giving his shadow a little freedom so it doesn’t always need to walk beside him. Now that the dust has settled from the Divine Sunderer changes on patch 12.13 it’s still performing a bit stronger than we’d like it to. We’re opting to decrease the amount of healing this item provides to bring it more in line with other mythic options. Mercurial Scimitar hasn’t been as appealing recently given its role as an important itemization option that provides magic resist, critical strike chance, and a built-in cc removal effect. We’re increasing the benefits that come with this item to make it a little more tempting of an option compared to the other sword items carries can opt for. While it’s not quite as weak as Mercurial Scimitar, Silvermere Dawn is also underperforming as a whole. We’re opting to increase its defensive capabilities as well, but not quite as much as its counterpart. First strike has risen to prominence as the go-to choice for burst champions in the current meta. We’re reining in a bit of its burst potential which should also decrease the amount of gold this Rune can generate. Team formation for the second weekend of the Zaun Cup Clash starts on August 15, and the tournament days are on August 20 and 21. The Star Guardian event may be ending, but Ultimate Spellbook is sticking around for a little while longer! As a reminder, starting on August 19 Pacific Time, RP and TFT coin prices will increase in most Riot regions. For more information about the price increase check out our full article here. Having a premade duo is a slight advantage, and while current Apex Tier (Masters, Grandmaster, and Challenger) players aren’t able to duo with anyone, the system only works off current rank. With this change, we’re tightening up the Apex Tier restriction to apply to MMR as well. The goal of this is to prevent climbing smurfs from being able to duo queue into Apex Tier. That said, decayed Apex Tier players and the highest skilled Diamond I players may also be impacted by this change. Up until now these players could duo and reliably get into Apex Tier games, which isn't fair when the people they're playing against can't duo. If this change works as expected, we'll evaluate shipping it to the rest of the world with plans to re-evaluate before Season Start. We first rolled out this change back in patch 12.10 on the NA and KR servers as a trial and the results have been positive, so we’re rolling it out to the rest of the world. From now on, players with an MMR correlating to Master or above will no longer be able to duo queue in Ranked Solo/Duo, even if their rank is not Master or higher."
12.16,2022-08-23,"It’s time to unleash the spirits and start stance dancin’—welcome to patch 12.16! With World’s slowly sneaking up on us, we wanted to let you know that this will be the first of several patches that will address balance issues at the highest levels of play. That said, this patch Udyr’s VGU will be hitting the Rift so be sure to give it a try! We’re also making quite a few ARAM balance adjustments, introducing a super-secret-special game variant to Ultimate Spellbook, and rotating the Mythic Shop. In other news, it's the last patch before TFT's midset, Uncharted Realms, so come on over to the Dragonlands to hit those ranked goals before exploring the new traits and units! Read more about the last patch changes here. Commune with spirits as you walk the wilds of the Freljord with Udyr's VGU releasing this patch! We're introducing a set of five new icons to match Spirit Guard Udyr's new look. The original icons will no longer be obtainable, but they'll stick around in your inventory if you've got 'em. You'll get the new ones automatically when you buy Spirit Guard Udyr, and if you already own him you can pick them up in the store for 5 RP. Caitlyn is a step behind other current top tier marksmen, especially when compared to those that scale heavily with attack speed. We want to emphasize the more unique parts of her crit-heavy builds, so we’re giving her more crit synergies to help her hit a little harder. Diana has been finding success with tanky builds recently. While AP bruisers should be able to flex into more durable itemizations, we want to make sure they’re still rewarded when opting for riskier, full damage builds. We’re shifting her numbers so that her tank builds do a bit less damage and her AP-heavy builds do a bit more. Draven has been an axe juggling terror in Elite brackets of play since his post-Durability Update buffs in patch 12.10. We’re rolling back the base damage portion of these buffs which helped him reach dominance in the bot lane. Irelia is a tad weaker than her skirmisher friends in both the top and mid lane. We’re giving her a small power-up so that she has a better chance to succeed in a meta focused around safe, scaling laners. Jayce’s melee form hasn’t been the shining innovation of Piltover (or his kit) it once was. We’re putting some more Hextech power into his hammer by increasing its damage output so that it remains a viable tool for Jayce, even in later stages of the game. Kai’Sa has been struggling recently, particularly when it comes to her more attack speed or AP-oriented build paths. We’re giving her some scaling power, but in a way that should avoid buffing her problematic full-AP-W-hits-for-half-my-health builds. Malphite’s currently stuck between himself and a hard place in the top lane. We’re giving him some more early game durability by bringing down his passive cooldowns and giving him some rock solid damage gains in the mid and late game in the form of more Thunderclaps. Poppy has been the shining hero of the jungle in Professional play to the point where she’s starting to look more like a villain. In order not to nerf her in top lane, we’re giving her some jungle specific nerfs to slightly reduce her current clear speed. The Yordle Gunner hasn’t been seeing much love recently, so we’re making her Rapid Fire a little more rapid in the hopes she’ll be a more appealing pick in the bot (and possibly mid) lane. Yuumi has had a very high pick rate in Professional play recently given that she synergizes well with a lot of the current meta picks and has strong scaling into the late game. We’re taking a little bit of the zoom out of her Zoomies so that her friends are a little less unkillable. Zeri has remained at the top of the Professional meta despite repeated changes over the past several patches. We’re nerfing her for now so we can reassess her state and path forward after Worlds. We’re also taking this opportunity to nerf the AP ratio on her W, as this play pattern has gameplay issues similar to AP Kai'Sa. Like other burst mages, Zoe hasn't been having the most fun after the Durability Update. We’re adding a little boost in damage when she hits her Trouble Bubble and helping her grab a few more spells in mid-to-late game for teamfights. We’re making an adjustment to Zyra’s animation lock after she casts her E so it’s now more consistent when used. This should result in a small buff for more skilled Zyra players. Enchanters are still overshadowing other support classes, so we’re looking to put some more power into tank supports to even the playing field. So we’re buffing Evenshroud’s damage amplification systems which took a small hit with the Durability Update. Team formation for the first weekend of the Noxus Cup starts on August 29, and the tournament days are on September 3 and 4. The Mythic Shop rotates this patch! This is a small rotation, meaning only the unvaulted Prestige skins and new Mythic Chroma are rotating. The next large rotation will be in patch 12.18. We have some VFX updates for Fizz’s base and older skins coming this patch!"
12.17,2022-09-07,"Welcome to patch 12.17, the penultimate patch before Worlds! With Worlds being played on patch 12.18 this is the last opportunity for us to introduce larger scale changes without significantly changing the current state of the meta in Pro play. This patch we’ll be focusing on pulling some power out of picks that have been dominating playoffs throughout the world. That said, we also have quite a few buffs for champions that haven’t been seeing as much play recently, as well as larger scope updates to champions like Maokai and Hecarim. Without further ado, to Worlds we go! TFT is launching its new mid-set, Uncharted Realms, which brings more Dragons, more Treasure, and more—read about it all over at the TFT patch notes here! Ahri has been charming pros across the globe with her safe playstyle and strong ability to set up plays. We're bringing these strengths down just a tad so that playing into Ahri isn't such a tail order and that players can’t just rely on her charm as a singular strength. The Emperor of the Sands can quickly become the Emperor of the Mid Lane in Pro play when he's too powerful. We're reducing the safety of his laning phase and bringing down his late game scaling so that he maintains his identity as a hyper scaler, but without scaling too hard. Camille is currently a cut below other prominent picks in the top lane. We’re giving her a little extra engage and trading power so that she has an opportunity to shine when the conditions are right, but will still be kept in check by champions that counter her. Ezreal's lost his place in pro play and solo queue recently (maybe because of his distaste for maps), so we're shifting him into a stronger place by buffing his E to create more windows for clutch defensive or offensive plays. The current jungle meta favors engage-style fighters that bring a lot of CC and utility to help their teams and Graves hasn’t been able to compete with these picks. So we're giving Graves a bit more power and clear speed to help him find his niche in the jungle once again. Hecarim hasn’t been the most stable champion for the past few seasons, either being a dominant Pro jungler or underwhelming in solo queue. He's also been horsing around with a variety of builds ranging from tank, to assassin, to fighter. We believe a Hecarim that's more bruiser/fighter focused is both more rewarding to play and will be less Pro skewed. To that end, we’re saddling Hecarim with some Q and W adjustments that should help his synergies with fighter items. We’re also lowering his base utility power and damage to reduce his strengths as a pure tank. These changes should lead to more damage-oriented Hecarim builds. Kassadin has typically found play as a counter pick into mages, so we want to lean into that by giving him some additional power going into those tough matchups. Now he should be able to find some success and get those Kassawins. Maokai has been all bark and no bite for quite some time now. We’re helping this tree rediscover his roots in both the top lane and jungle without removing his ability to be a support. Miss Fortune has always been able to flex into either crit/attack speed or Lethality builds. Recently, her crit builds have been a bit weak while her Lethality builds opt into spamming E in lane instead of utilizing her Double Up. We’re looking to make MF’s crit/attack speed builds hit a bit harder while incentivizing Lethality builds to use Q as her preferred harass tool. Electrocute Nami has been Lucian’s best friend given that they could quickly proc Nami’s Electrocute with Lucian’s Q double auto combo. We’re changing how Nami’s E counts toward Electrocute to be more in line with similar abilities. This should also make Nami viable with other pairings. Besides, fish and electrocutions together never go swimmingly. Nocturne’s been left out in the dark recently, which, while on-point for his theme, hasn’t been as great for his performance in-game. We’re giving him some buffs which should help out his attack speed itemization synergies and increase his clear speed a tad. Rell has been out of the spotlight for quite some time now so we’re giving her some small quality of life buffs to help her get back on her iron steed. Renekton is back to his old ways of being a dominant, blind pickable champion in the top lane. Not only can he go head-to-head with the strongest melee champions, but he can also dominate ranged opponents. We’re decreasing his damage output (especially when not itemizing AD) to give other champions some space to play. Sett hasn't been getting much face time in the top lane, especially given the amount of tanks we're seeing that he should be a strong matchup into. We're increasing his damage and reliable CC to help this boss beat down his opponents more effectively. Sivir's midscope update has succeeded in making her the premiere AOE damage marksman in the game. However, her damage output is currently a bit too reliable. We're pulling a bit of power out of her AOE damage so that she isn't always shoving in her lane opponents and hitting the jackpot come late-game teamfights. Sylas is currently too reliable of a pick between the waveclear provided by his Q max builds and safety/engage options his E provides him in Pro play. We're looking to bring down his laning phase power with some targeted nerfs at his early waveclear and durability. Taric has been a little too dazzling in the bot lane recently, excelling at healing and CC in addition to being too durable. We're making him a bit less stunning by reducing the uptime on his... er.... stuns and making him a bit more susceptible to poke in losing matchups. The Troll King has been expanding his domain into the jungle. While we don’t want to kick him out, we are tapping down his W to hinder his clear speed slightly and reduce the effectiveness of his problematic 100% uptime, early W max builds. Despite having an entire deck of cards (okay, only 3 but still), Twisted Fate is forced into drawing blue cards a bit more often than we'd like. In order to help him diversify his draws, we're relaxing his current mana restrictions so players can feel more free to play around his harder hitting red and yellow cards. As opposed to the king of monkeys, Wukong has been the king of the jungle in Pro play for quite some time. We’re looking to dethrone him by bringing his early clear down a few pegs and reducing his ability to move around the map as effectively. Since its introduction Stopwatch has been a powerful item, not only in solo queue, but especially in Pro play with extremely low ping. We’re increasing its purchase price so that if it's bought as a one-time-use item it sets players back more in the gold department. Now that Stopwatch is moving up in price, so is Guardian Angel. With stasis being more expensive, players should feel as though they need to deliberately itemize Stopwatch and its corresponding items as opposed to them feeling like auto-buys just because you purchased a Stopwatch. Seeker’s Armguard has been a relatively weak component for some time now. We don’t want it to turn into an early anti-assassin item that discourages aggression from opponents in lane, so we’re opting to increase its AP stats so it’s more comparable to other Zhonya’s components. On the same note, due to the Stopwatch price increase Zhonya’s will also be getting a price hike. Hourglass has remained a cheap defensive option with a value defined by its ability to provide Stasis to its users since Season 10. We’re moving the item up to a higher price point so that its offensive capabilities have an opportunity to stand out more. Over the last 8 months since we released our new feeding detection model, we have gained the confidence that allows us to make significant adjustments to what we detect as intentional feeding. We expect an increase in detections and punishments of over 2x. (Reminder that punishments for intentional feeding are a 14-day ban for the first transgression, and a permanent ban for the second.) Chat restrictions will be visible on the lobbies screen for yourself and any party members, as well as on individual profile pages. Honor restrictions applied to your account will be visible on your profile page with a lock icon and tooltip. Summoner’s Rift Ranked queue matchmaking will now focus more on player’s MMR and less on their visible rank (e.g. Silver or Gold). Team formation for the second weekend of the Noxus Cup starts on September 12, and the tournament days are on September 17 and 18. Global Defense System has been added! (Have a control ward in the enemy jungle for 65+% of the game.)"
12.18,2022-09-20,"Welcome to the 2022 Worlds patch! Following the trend of our last two patches, 12.18 is focused on tuning down some overperforming picks in Pro like Kalista and Lulu, while giving a little power to champions just under everyone's radar. Since our goal isn't to completely change the meta from playoffs, these adjustments will be on the lighter side. And with that, to Worlds we go! Secrets of the Shallows, a new TFT event kicks off this patch with Pengu and company charting the Uncharted Realms! Uncover that and more at the TFT patch notes here! While Ashe has recently gained popularity as a support, her power hasn't been quite up to par with other marksmen. We're increasing her damage to help her shine a bit more in a meta that lacks utility ADC options. Hecarim came charging out of the gates after his update last patch. We're bringing down his overall power with these nerfs, but aiming to reduce the strength of his AD builds in particular without bringing tank Hec back from the dead. Kalista's been a popular Pro pick for quite some time now due to her overwhelmingly dominant laning phase. We're making her a bit more punishable in lane in situations where she overcommits early on. Rhaast has been winning the preferred Kayn form battle in most skill levels recently. Not only does he offer a surprising amount of damage, but he's also proving to be a hard-to-kill drain tank. We want to lean more into his identity as a healing tank, so we're taking his damage down so he no longer gets the best of both forms. Would this even be a Worlds patch without a Lee Sin buff? Jokes aside, Lee isn't in a great spot right now. He hasn't seen much play in Pro recently and has been struggling quite a bit in solo queue, so we're giving this fan and pro favorite some high skill level skewed buffs to help him find his place once again. Lulu has been the best enchanter on the Rift as of late. Not only is she great at keeping her carries alive, but she brings boatloads of utility to her team. We're tuning down one of her most powerful tools in Pro play to bring her in line with other enchanters. Maokai's update has been transplanted to the Rift successfully, taking root not only in support, but in top as well (which was one of our major goals!). He's been struggling to branch out into the jungle, so we're giving him some jungle oriented buffs in hopes they bear fruit while trimming some of his strengths in other roles. We’re sorry. These plant puns are just low hanging fruit. Miss Fortune's buffs in patch 12.17 really hit the mark for both of her builds, even after the mid-patch nerfs. Her crit/attack speed builds benefitted much more than lethality, so we're tuning that build down a bit while also giving her a more generic health nerf to bring her down just a peg. Nocturne's buffs last patch made him a little too strong. We're pulling a bit of power out of his base stats so that he isn't quite as terrifying, but still sufficiently scary. Thresh has been a ghost of his former self, falling behind many of his support peers this season. We're being cautious with buffs because we don't want him to become THE support (especially with Worlds coming up), but we do want Thresh players to feel better about being more aggressive as the game progresses as opposed to scaling into a lantern delivery service. Like most new/updated champs, as all of you have gotten more used to Newdyr the stronger he has become. Now he's a tad more powerful than we'd like. Our goals with these adjustments are to bring his scaling down a bit, shift some power from his R-max to his Q-max (particularly in lanes), reduce the strength of his W-max second, and incentivize players to take at least 1 point in Q early. When autofill protection was initially introduced, support was by far the least popular role. However, role preferences have shifted over time and can also vary heavily by region. Around a year ago we made behind-the-scenes changes to proactively protect players from autofill if they were queuing for high demand positions. We’re pulling back the curtain now and indicating which roles are in high demand when you’re selecting your role with a “priority” tag in the lobby. Now you can decide if you’d like to queue for one of these roles to avoid being autofilled in your next game and to get into a game more quickly. Players you have recently honored or who have recently honored you will show up in the suggested party members menu with an honor icon next to their summoner name. Now you can run it back with those you’ve already enjoyed playing with! Team formation for the first weekend of Worlds Clash will be open starting on September 26 and the tournaments will be on October 1 and 2. In addition to the trophy, banner, and logo rewards of other Clash tournaments, Worlds Clash has an additional reward of a loot capsule! This loot capsule will contain the following: New Challenges coming at you in patch 12.18!"
12.19,2022-10-04,"Fighter Blitzcrank buffs? AP Rakan buffs? Is this real life, or is this patch 12.19? In this patch we’ll be introducing Syndra’s midscope update, make sure to read on to learn more about all of her adjusted and upgraded abilities! This patch also contains quite a few buffs to some off-meta builds, a Janna VFX update that’ll blow you away, and information on the new Event Pass Evolved System. Thanks for reading and see you on the Rift! The winds of change are hitting the Convergence too, check out the TFT patch notes here! Syndra's been in an awkward spot for a while now. Previously an iconic mid lane mage, balancing her around Pro Play has led to Syndra losing her unique identity, leaving her with so much untapped power. And that’s how we got to Syndra’s midscope update! With this update, we’re aiming to recapture Syndra’s fantasy of unlimited power in a new way: a brand new passive that upgrades each of her abilities over time. These changes should help Syndra players feel as though their power is growing over time and give more compelling upgrades ranging from more explosive burst combos to debilitating crowd control. Each of Syndra’s abilities will receive new, powerful effects when upgraded through her passive and will also get a brand new upgraded icon. Each of the changes is outlined below, but we hope you enjoy this midscope and this whole new world to toy with! Fun fact, Blitzcrank was initially designed as a fighter champion! While they’ve found their place in the support role over the years, we still think it could be fun to let the Great Steam Golem try their hand at something other than grabbing. We’re buffing some more “fighter” parts of Blitz’s kit to make them a more proficient duelist at as little of a cost to their primary support playstyle as possible—so put on those Boom Boom Blitzcrank skins and get punchin’! Hah. Hah. Hah. Ekko has been a bit weak for a few patches now and while he can’t turn back time to when he was a terror, we can give him a few buffs to increase his damage output in a way that still leaves his opponents some counterplay opportunities. Fizz hasn’t been doing too hot recently, which biologically I would assume is good, but for players he’s feeling a bit lackluster. So we’re putting a bit more strength into his combo by adding damage into one of his higher counterplay spells. Watch out for those crit Garen players, they know something that we don’t. Jinx hasn’t been her usual chipper, chaotic self recently, so we’re giving her a bit more explosive power in the form of base damage buffs. For a marksman that can flex between multiple builds, AP Kai’Sa has been quite weak since her nerfs a few patches ago. We’re giving her AP builds some strength back in a way that won’t lead to her W spamming ways again. Malphite is a rock. Rocks are nature. Nature is magical. Therefore, Malphite should be magical. We’re buffing AP Malphite so he has a bit of extra power to finish off opponents that somehow survive his ultimate. Master Yi's been a top tier jungler at all skill brackets after his recent changes which means we’ve succeeded in our original goal! Now that he has more creative ways to stay alive with perfect Meditates and slippery Alpha Strikes, he's doing a bit too much damage. We’re taking down his damage a bit now that he’s staying alive long enough to do more. Nasus has historically found success in lower skill brackets. Similar to the Yi changes in patch 12.13, we’re looking to give Nasus some high skill skewed buffs to make him stronger in higher levels of play. Turns out AP Nunu is real, and he can hurt you. We’re giving AP Nunu some more strength so that he can more effectively one shot squishies bold enough to facecheck brushes. There are a small number of people out there that are AP Rakan enjoyers and we want you to know that we see you. These buffs are for you. Also, support Rakan could use the help as well. Rek’Sai is the queen of the jungle, particularly in the early game, snowballing early ganks better than almost every other jungler at the highest levels of play. We’re bringing her early damage down so that her early ganks aren’t as potent as often. Ryze hasn't been the Pro Play terror that earned him his notoriety, so we're putting some magic power into his kit that will increase the potency of his full AP builds. Right now Shyvana’s best builds are her tank ones, despite that one time we all got one-shot by a Shyvana E on ARAM. We’re giving her some more AD and AP scaling in place of base damage to help out her alternative and exciting build paths. Sona’s beats power has been dropping, so we’re giving her some more early game strength to boost her excitement and poke levels. AP Tahm Kench has never really been a thing... until now. Maybe. There are actually a lot of AP Twitch cheesers and we want you to know that we also see you. Go forth onto the Rift magical plague rat. The changes in the last patches hit top lane Udyr a bit harder than we had intended. Watch out minions, because this buff means Udyr’s coming for YOU. Eclipse has become popular on several bruiser champions and is generally outperforming other fighter Mythic items. It’s also been the best lethality mythic on assassins and ranged lethality users for quite some time. So we’re taking down its overall power and looking into reshaping this item to better fit the stats fighters would like moving forward while keeping it as a viable purchase for assassins. Janna’s new VFX update will be hitting the Rift this patch! Team formation for the second week of Worlds Clash will be open on October 10th and the tournaments will be on October 15th and 16th. In addition to the trophy, banner, and logo rewards of other Clash tournaments, Worlds Clash has an additional reward of a loot capsule! This loot capsule will contain the following:"
12.20,2022-10-18,"It’s time for the spookiest patch of the year. We have a few treats in patch 12.20, so let’s dig in! Okay, in all honesty, this patch isn’t all treats, it looks like a few nerfs snuck into our bag of goodies. We’re bringing down the power levels of a few overperforming champs like Maokai and Aatrox to make them a bit less terrifying. On the bright side, we do have some enchanting buffs for champions like Evelynn and Gwen—‘tis their season after all! Lastly, we have a new batch of goodies bewitching skins that’ll scare your socks off! We’ll also be introducing a big update to our language detection system in this patch. Now zero tolerance language will be detected and stopped LIVE and players using this language will automatically be system muted. Looking to experience a scary 50 gold roll down only to not hit any of your key units? Well learn more about your odds in the TFT patch notes here! Aatrox's Passive not only gives him tons of damage, but also tons of healing when Lethality amplifies his percent max health damage. While the Eclipse nerfs last patch did weaken him a little, he's still too powerful when picking up Eclipse and Goredrinker. We're taking his healing down a notch so that he'll need to rely more on landing skillshots to sustain himself. Haven’t you always wanted to swing around a tower forever? Well now you can. WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE Last patches changes succeeded in getting players to give jungle Blitzcrank a try. Unfortunately, it's still not as strong as we'd like it to be. On the other hand, the changes unintentionally supercharged his strength as a support. We're tweaking his numbers in a way that should nerf his support strength and increase his jungle power. Elise's Q range is currently slightly shorter than her auto attack range which leads to an awkward half step when she Q-autos enemies. This range adjustment should make her combos feel much smoother and, even though the number went down, this should result in a slight range increase, especially against larger enemies. Evelynn's been feeling invisible compared to her fellow AP assassins, so we're giving her some more burst power in her higher counterplay abilities so she can take her enemy's breath away... permanently. Or at least until they respawn. Gwen hasn't been scary in quite a while as she currently needs to get into late game to start gaining an edge over her opponents. We're sharpening her mid-game power a tad to help her better compete with other, similar fighters. As a late game Jayce, it can be a little scary to swap to your hammer and jump straight into the enemy team. We're giving him some small buffs to his durability in the late game and giving him some more tools to play with in his hammer form. Ninjas don’t have limits and neither should Kennen. Maokai's update has led to him taking root across several roles, but his roots run deepest (and strongest) in the top lane. We're trimming down his sustain in the mid-to-late game and upping his ultimate cooldown to hedge his strength. A bugfix in 12.19 to Rammus' W resulted in a sizable nerf to everyone's favorite Armordillo. We're removing some of his training weights so that now he'll be even faster. That said, we'll be keeping an eye out to make sure he's still speedy and tanky and adjust as needed. Sett is the boss. The boss is always on top. He isn't happy being in the middle of the pack, or the middle of the map. So we’re tuning his numbers so that his mid lane strength is a bit weaker without affecting his top lane strength. Right now Wukong's damage output is actually greater if he ends his ult before it times out which feels pretty bad. We're putting some more strength into his ultimate so that the Monkey King can spin to win for the full duration of his ultimate. Ziggs has been struggling to blast off this year and finds himself in need of a little extra explosive power in his kit. We're packing his bombs with a bit more powder so he should find more success shoving lane for more map priority. Demonic Embrace is functioning well for AP bruisers and ranged Damage over time champions, but it's performing too well on full tanks like Zac, Amumu, and Udyr to name a few. We're skewing its power to be more AP heavy so that it’s roughly the same on primary users and slightly nerfed for pure tank users. Frozen Heart has been a strong tank item for the majority of the season, however it's recently popped up as an early rush item on non-tanks. We're reducing its base damage reduction to make it better synergize with tanks, and upping the gold cost so non-tanks will have to delay their damage items longer if they want to build it. While we've buffed Mortal Reminder to be a better Grievous Wounds item, it still competes directly with Phantom Dancer in terms of stats for ADC's weighing their options. We're emphasizing its AD component more so it can stand out against Phantom Dancer’s attack speed and move speed offerings. Sterak's has fallen behind Death's Dance as a preferred juggernaut/fighter item since champions aren't as worried about getting immediately burst down. We're buffing this item to make it more relevant to juggernauts so that it will still be taken into consideration when deciding on their itemizations. Players in higher skill brackets are getting significantly more value out of the attack range increase to the point that it's warping the meta to an unhealthy degree. This keystone is primarily meant to be an attack speed rune, so we're bringing its range down. Zero-tolerance language will now be detected live and in-game. When detected, these messages will not be sent to other players, the offending player will be system muted, and all players will be notified. With our growing confidence in feeding detection, we're increasing the strictness of the model for high-level play in Ranked Solo/Duo. We'll continue evaluating play in other queues and make adjustments as necessary. Recently honored players will now be visible in the Add Friend and Friend Requests menus. We want to make sure it’s easy to keep playing with those players you’ve enjoyed playing with in the past! A new batch of Event Missions has arrived. Continue to make progress on your Event Pass with the Tales from the Rift narrative missions which will be available to all players. Enjoy the party! We heard your feedback loud and clear! Mythic Chroma Icons are receiving updates to standardize their features. Moving forward, all Mythic Chroma Icons will feature the following: Icons receiving changes in patch 12.20 include: In this Mythic Shop rotation, we’ll have two Unvaulted Prestige skins and a Mythic Chroma."
12.21,2022-11-01,"The World Championship Final is this weekend, K’Sante is here, and Preseason 2023 is coming. There’s no time to dally, so let’s jump straight into patch 12.21! This is going to be a relatively light patch as we get ready for all the exciting Preseason changes around the corner, so we’re doing a few smaller balance adjustments this time around. That said, big things come in small packages and this patch introduces K’Sante, the Pride of Nazumah, so make sure to try him out! Thanks for reading and see you in the next patch! World’s hype got you wanting more? Well check out the Dragonlands championship TFT patch notes here! Hear his name and know his strength on November 3. Ahri's Charm nerf back in patch 12.17 left her a little on the weak side, so instead of making her MORE charming again, we're opting to increase her damage output over CC potential. Bel'Veth has been the empress of the jungle recently, which last we checked wasn't canon. We’re adding more downtime to her E so it’s not always up (especially if she's been using it to farm), while also reducing her ability to snowball leads quite so effectively with all her cute lil baby remoras. Blitzcrank's jungle buffs have continued to make him a potent threat to his opponent, only in the wrong position... We're tuning down his support strength which has been a bit overwhelming due to his jungle oriented buffs in the last two patches. Corki's been flying low for a while now so we're buffing his shorter-range builds by giving him some more durability and higher Sheen synergy. In the early game Malzahar relies on his Malefic Visions to help last-hit, however, due to its slow tick-rate and low damage it sometimes feels uncertain whether or not you’ll actually get the last hit. We’re adding a small assistance mechanic to help him and will monitor its success to see if other similar champions can benefit from the same changes. Miss Fortune is still ruling the high seas and bot lane with her Q adjustments in 12.17. We're dropping her Make It Rain slow so her early game is a bit less dominant. AP Miss Fortune was also hurt as collateral damage, so we're giving a little love tap to these ARAM off-meta builds. Sometimes there are bugs that end up becoming features. Ornn's ultimate has been inflicting a 60% slow for some time now and we've decided to make this feature official as of this patch. ...Woops. (Note: this will result in no change compared to the live patch.) Xin Zhao is still finding his footing in a meta where he struggles to do much after laning phase when everyone is walking around being more durable and whatnot. We're giving him a little more strength for when he's able to stick to opponents as the game progresses. We’re shortening the remake timer so that you’re able to remake a match when someone’s absence would start affecting the match’s competitive integrity—if they’ve been gone from the start of the game. This patch isn’t significantly modifying the underlying systems and additional work is planned to make remake functionality more resilient. For a more comprehensive explanation of the feature, see this player support Remake FAQ. A new batch of Event Missions has arrived! Continue to make progress on your Event Pass with the Empyrean narrative missions which will be available to all players. We’ve also made an adjustment to these missions and added an additional 440 XP to each mission bringing the total up to 8,300 XP (previously 3,900). With all three mission chains released (Spirit Blossom, Tales from the Rift, and Empyrean), players can also complete the Worlds Tour 2022 mission for an additional 500 XP."
12.22,2022-11-15,"The patch notes are here and there’s A LOT of them. We have Chemtech Drake’s redemption arc, a brand new Chemtech Rift, three new adorable jungle companions, seven new items, new ARAM balance changes, new… well you get the point. Welcome to League of Legends 2023 Preseason! It's the last patch of Dragonlands over at TFT and the team is doubling down on the Treasure Dragon mechanic and shipping a ton of buffs. Read more about it at the TFT patch notes here! Chemtech Drake is BACK and better than ever! Our goal with the new-and-improved drake is to encourage calculated, aggressive plays and incentivize players to fight to the end to gain the edge over their opponents. Go big or go home! Alongside the new drake is the new Chemtech Rift! The Chemtech gas we introduced to the Rift in last year’s preseason was a bit too toxic for a good gameplay experience, so we opted to take a more measured approach this year. Now, instead of sitting on the surface, the Zaunite chemicals have seeped their way into the Rift, mutating the environment and enhancing each of the jungle plants with different effects. We’ve got a lot of jungle changes to unpack here, so let’s jump right into it! One of the biggest changes you’ll notice is that all the camps got their own little Durability Update. Our goals with this update are to make it more of an investment for laners to take jungle camps (especially in the early game), keeping fast clear speeds fast while making slow clearers slightly less slow by shifting jungle dps into companions, and shifting some gold and experience from the jungle itself into the new jungle items. On the other hand, we actually made Krugs a less durable camp by removing the 2 Krugs that spawned from the Ancient Krug which should make the camp less of a time sink and allow for more interesting early game jungle pathing. We've also made quite a few adjustments to reduce how effectively both laners and enemy junglers can poach camps. The Own-Side clearing strength changes are meant to speed up how fast junglers clear their own jungle while increasing the opportunity cost of invading. This Own-Side Clearing Strength change will also help tone down very early invades and vertical jungling which, while interesting and powerful, is currently too reliant on your team's ability to play around you and maintain early lane pressure. In addition, the new Marked for Death change should make getting counter jungled a bit less punishing as well. To be clear, we absolutely do want counter jungling in the game and believe it should be an effective strategy for junglers. However, the current state of counter jungling is far too strong and punishing, making it an incredibly miserable experience for those being invaded which isn’t ideal for the role. And now a paragraph just for our favorite Rift Scuttlers. Scuttle has two key issues we’re trying to correct: breaking its shield was a miserable experience for junglers unable to do so and champion viability in the jungle was dependent on whether or not your champion could reach Scuttle by 3:15. While we completely removed the former, we shifted the spawn time for Scuttle to 3:30 to help slower junglers take their time clearing while faster ones can get in a sweet pre-Scuttle gank now. Last big change to discuss is sustain in the jungle. We’re taking the healing power out of Smite and Gromp and spreading it across the jungle with the jungle companions. When the % health on-hit damage from some camps is factored in, this should result in a jungle where only a few champions finish their clear with low health, most champions have a decent amount of health to work with, and sustain oriented champions leave very healthy. After all, if every champion could heal like Warwick, there wouldn’t be much value in Warwick’s innate sustain. It’s dangerous to go into the jungle alone, so take one of these jungle companions! Traditional jungle items will now be replaced by adorable, feisty, and all-around wholesome companions. If you bring Smite, you'll have the option to purchase Mosstomper, Scorchclaw, or Gustwalker in egg form at the beginning of the game. They’ll grow and evolve as you progress in the game by getting stacks from monster and champion takedowns, so make sure to give them lots of treats/stacks and love. In an effort to conserve the Rift ecosystem, we strongly recommend that our furry and scaly friends (and Smite) be kept in the jungle. Jungle companions will evolve twice throughout the game by acquiring treats via the following methods: As jungle companions evolve, they will receive the following bonuses at each evolution: In an effort to make the jungle more welcoming to players unfamiliar with the role, we’ll be adding visual leashing indicators that will show how far camps can be pulled before their patience starts diminishing. We’re also decreasing the distance camps can be pulled, so no more having to stand on the perfect pixel to clear two camps at once in order to hyper-optimize your clears. Starting off your first clear on the wrong foot can be quite punishing for junglers, especially when the opponent knows exactly how to optimize their clear straight into their first gank. In order to make this first clear less punishing for newer or off-role junglers, we’re adding first clear pathing recommendations. These recommendations will be shown on your minimap and above camps visually, indicating the recommended order of your first clear. These first clear paths were determined by gathering data from high-skilled junglers on their high mastery champs across the globe. Pathing recommendations are based on win percentage and will be updated each patch. It’s worth noting that your first clear order will always be situational depending on team comps and lane/jungle matchups. This is not meant to replace the skills and knowledge needed to have an optimal first clear, but more so intended to help those less familiar with the role. League is a team game at its core. In order to better facilitate communication between teammates, we’re doubling the number of pings available to players. The 8 pings on the wheel will now be as follows: We’re also adding an entirely new ping wheel that focuses primarily on vision. Using this wheel, you can now indicate the following: The Caution ping, which exists outside of the ping wheel system, is staying the same, with some updated visuals. Getting your team on board with taking an objective can be difficult, and having everyone ping simultaneously can get very confusing very quickly. We’re introducing a new voting function that will appear when objectives are pinged that works similarly to a surrender vote. Now all players can vote and indicate whether or not they’d like to take or contest that objective. The jungler’s vote will be counted as 2 votes and a total of 4 votes for or against will be considered aligned. Our hope is that this helps teams better plan around global objectives together because sometimes the team call is better than the right call. While there are currently ways to see how many wards you have out on the map, there isn’t a quick way to check which wards are closest to expiring. We’re introducing new ward visuals on the minimap that will indicate when wards are close to expiring. Allied ward minimap icons will now change appearance when they reach a third of their remaining duration. It can be hard to keep track of every single ward that gets placed on the map and even harder to successfully communicate that information to your teammates. Now, if you use a vision ping near an enemy ward that you've seen within the last 10 seconds—or just attack it—a perfectly accurate ward timer that is always visible to all teammates will appear until the ward is removed or expires. In a continuous effort to make League of Legends more welcoming to newer players, we are adding in-game ability level-up recommendations. These visual indicators will appear once you level up and highlight which ability is typically leveled by players at each level. This information will be updated with each patch so that you’re all getting the latest and greatest information. We’ll also be making some adjustments to help top laners scale better relative to other lanes, and hit those key item and level breakpoints faster relative to mid and bot. TL;DR: Mid and top are getting a bit more XP, bot duo is getting a bit less, and mid is getting a bit less gold. When we introduced Mythic items in the item update, we designed them to be first item purchases that defined the playstyle of your build. As we’ve seen all of you test hundreds of thousands of build variations, we’ve revisited our Mythic item philosophy and now believe that these items don't always have to be first item rushes. Sometimes a Legendary item better fits the item profile a champion is looking for, and given the wide breadth of champion playstyles in the game we believe there's no need to be overly restrictive. With the relaxed restriction on Mythic items as a first purchase, we are revamping tank Mythics without the presence of Immolate, allowing them to focus less on damage/farming and more on enabling the core tank fantasies of having tons of durability or crowd control (or both)! To this end we'll be introducing three new Mythic tank items, as well as reworking Frostfire Gauntlet back to its former frosty glory: Iceborn Gauntlet. Turbo Chemtank and Sunfire Cape will be moving to the Legendary item space and have their effects simplified. Finally, we'll be making some smaller changes to a few other tank items to ensure they have the tools they need in this new world, including the return of an old friend for mages and tanks alike. Without further ado, let’s dive into the items! Become an unkillable monstrosity over the course of a fight. This is the Ornn upgraded version of Jak’Sho, the Protean. Become a shining light and lead the charge as a beacon of hope for your allies. This is the Ornn upgraded version of Radiant Virtue. Grow into a goliath that towers over foes and pummels the opposition. This is the Ornn upgraded version of Heartsteel. Control the battlefield and cripple the opposition. This is the Ornn upgraded version of Iceborn Gauntlet The one you’ve all been waiting for. An old friend returns to help you scale into the late game. This is the Ornn upgraded version of Rod of Ages. Returning alongside Rod of Ages as a one-stop shop for health and mana sustain during laning phase. Abyssal Mask is a niche item that has struggled to find its way into builds. Returning Catalyst and its Eternity passive should make it a solid option for those looking for a combination of magic resist, mana, and health. Randuin's critical damage reduction being tied to the active has led to a less satisfying and less reliable version of the item. We're returning the reduction to its passive, the active to its longer slow, all while retaining the new Rock Solid passive. While it's no longer a mythic item, Sunfire is still your go-to option for waveclear and sustained damage as a tank. Rather than a jungle specific rush item, Chemtank should now be a possible mid-to-late game option for any tank looking for an extra bit of engage potential. Just a small gold adjustment for Aegis. Great for AD melee champions looking to carry their teams with damage. Updating Cleave’s damage to be more in line with the new Ravenous Hydra. Shojin is back! Become the AD caster you’ve always wanted to be. Navori’s was a bit too niche of an item in its previous form resulting in it often being skipped over. We’re adjusting it so that it competes with Infinity Edge as a build defining item, trading DPS for stronger spells and lower cooldowns. (Note: this item cannot be built with Guinsoo’s Rageblade or Infinity Edge) With the increased damage coming to Smite this patch we’re buffing up Cho’Gath’s Feast execute damage in order to keep it competitive with Smite—don’t let Cho near your Barons! Changing Lillia to a melee champion to be more intuitive with how she attacks. We expect this to be a slight buff to her, so we’re preemptively nerfing her passive. In a similar change to Cho’Gath, our goal is to keep Nunu & Willump’s Consume damage competitive with Smite so we’re upping its damage! Changing Rakan to a melee champion so that his attacks are more in line with player expectations. Updating Smite’s damage to correspond to the amount of stacks your jungle companion has accumulated throughout the game. In case you haven’t seen it yet, we’re updating our ARAM balance philosophy and will begin in patch 12.22 with some champion specific changes (read more about it in our full post here). This initial patch is expected to be a little rockier on the balance side while we gather data on some new buffs and nerfs we’re trying on specific champions. The end goal is to reduce our reliance on the damage taken/received modifiers, as several champions quickly lose counterplay when their damage is pushed too far. We want champions on ARAM to get to live their fantasy as much as we can allow, so we’re hoping to pull back on the damage in favor of making some champions more forgiving. We’re updating some champion base stats to make their numbers a bit more clean. The long-awaited upgrade to League’s text evaluation service we discussed earlier this year is being released with this patch! For a long time we've recognized disruptive chat in League of Legends, but haven't been able to target it as effectively as we wanted to because of the challenge of separating disruptive chat from well-meaning chat, especially chat which is marginally disruptive. With our new systems, we can more effectively identify the nuance between more egregious chat and less-severe, but still inappropriate, chat. With these improvements, we are expecting an increase of disruptive chat detections of over 20x. As a result of the significant increase in detections and penalties, we will be carefully monitoring these new systems to ensure their accuracy. When adding party members using the ‘+’ button, recently honored and matched players are included Currently if a player is AFK after the time the remake window passes, you need to wait until 10 minutes before your team is allowed to call for a unanimous early surrender. In line with our previous updates to the remake system, we want to give teams the agency to end the game when competitive integrity has been impacted. As we discussed in this article, we think the best version of League is not one where you metagame based on the players in your lobby. We also want to avoid using someone else’s win or loss streak/playing a different champion to force a dodge (or pressure others to dodge) when your setup doesn’t meet the perfect conditions. Whether someone is or isn’t connected to the game or pressing buttons on their mouse and keyboard, if they’re doing nothing but standing in the fountain then they aren’t playing the game. At the end of the day, this is what we want to protect against with the remake system. Eternals Series 2 is finally here! The new series includes three new unique Eternals for each champion. Similar to the previous series, Series 2 can be unlocked individually or as the pass for all current and future champions. With Series 2 comes a few additional changes. Players can gain a third chevron for their Mastery emotes once they pass 15 total Series 2 Milestones for that champion. Milestone requirements for all Series (including Starter Series and Series 1) have also been adjusted so that you can reach “Personal Best” scores even faster! See our “Eternals Series 2 Launch” FAQ for additional details when it goes live on November 16. In this Mythic Shop rotation, we’ll have two Unvaulted Prestige skins and a Mythic Chroma. The Summoner’s Rift Ranked season ended with Patch 12.21, so we hope you all got the ranks you were aiming for! End of Season Ranked rewards will be distributed to all players by December 14th. More details can be found at the Player Support page here! On a similar note, last patch was also your last chance to make progress on your 2022 Seasonal Challenges, so we hope you hit those goals!"
12.23,2022-12-06,"It’s the last patch of the year, 12.23 is here! Welcome to the ARAM/post-Preseason patch! This week we have a few large changes shipping to the Howling Abyss—like Frostgates, bridge repairs, and landscaping—so make sure you give them a try in our first-ever, free-to-enter ARAM Clash! We also have some Preseason follow ups shipping this patch to help a few struggling tanks, power down some overperforming junglers (Mordekaiser), and a shocking Zeri update. (Author’s Note: This is going to be a long patch as many of us will be on a Riot-wide break for the end of December. We’ll likely have mid-patch updates before we head out and when we get back, so if there are any big issues we’ll do our best to tackle them but we appreciate your patience!) Thanks for playing with us in 2022 and we’re looking forward to seeing you in 2023! We’re also shipping our 8th TFT set this patch! It’s a monster of a new set, so make sure to check out the TFT patch notes here! This update goes out to our ARAM players! From the new stat adjustments introduced in the last patch to falling towers and Frostgates, new and exciting updates are coming to the Howling Abyss this patch. A lot of the fun in ARAM happens when you're fighting, poking, or womboing your opponents—not when you're walking back to the fight. To help you get back into the action faster we're introducing Hexgates to the Howling Abyss! Some parts of the bridge have been showing their age recently and are starting to fall apart. Our goal with falling towers is to create more interesting situations on the map that break away from the usual straight line of ARAM. Now you’ll have new choke points to think about, Fog of War to hide in, and terrain you can experiment with to create new plays! Alongside the ARAM changes we figured we'd also do some landscaping on the bridge to help freshen things up a bit. We finally got around to making some repairs on Howling Abyss! With the new falling towers mechanic we wanted to make the bridge a bit more spacious to compensate for the space now taken up by tower rubble. Adding a few quality of life updates to the current Battle Boost feature. Go forth and get S rank on all the champs (or as many as your team's RNG will allow)! Mosstomper has come out of the gates as one of the stronger jungle companions introduced in Preseason. We’re making a few adjustments to Mosstomper’s current Tenacity bonuses so that enemies have a few more counterplay opportunities. We overshot a bit with Hydra’s overall stats, making it a much too efficient item for the gold that it cost. We’re preserving its niche as a rush item for champions that like the AD, but are reducing its AoE damage and pulling out the Ominvamp from stacks that was really pushing this item over the edge. With the recent downgrade to Sunfire Aegis we expected tanks to farm less effectively than they could with the Immolate passive. Unfortunately the changes landed a bit weak in 12.22 resulting in tanks opting to just not buy the item which, in turn, resulted in a loss of farm for top lane tanks (jungle tanks made out alright though thanks to the companions). We still want Sunfire to be a useful tool for tanks as a first or second item, but not mandatory. So this patch we’re addressing these issues by buffing the tanks whose ability to farm was impacted most and increasing the state efficiency of Sunfire so that it's a more reliable tank damage option. Despite his newfound companions in the jungle, Amumu has been a sad mummy. The new tank items and jungle changes really hurt his ability to clear come mid- to late-game relative to other junglers, so we’re shifting some of his power to cover these weaknesses without buffing his already strong Support power. The lack of early access to Immolate and overall tank item changes have resulted in a pretty sizable power loss for Cho. In order to help him feel like a good chonky monster again we’re putting some more power into his passive mana sustain and letting him feast on enemies a bit more often. Dr. Mundo hasn’t been living up to his unkillable late game fantasy lately, so the good doctor has received some treatment in order to help him out. We’ve made a bunch of changes to Mundo’s medical tools, but the biggest changes were to his Heart Stopper and Maximum Dosage which have been adjusted to be significantly stronger in the late game. Now get out there, throw some Qs, and be unkillable. K’Sante has been a tad weak in average skill brackets, so we’re giving him a few quality of life upgrades that should help him perform better in the hands of average players without pushing him over the line in elite play. We’re giving Kassadin some quality of life updates to his shield so he can perform better into ranged matchups. We’re also adjusting his E so that you can now cast it whenever you want (as long as it isn’t on cooldown)! Shadow Assassin Kayn has fallen off over the course of the Durability Update and Preseason. While we were cautious about returning damage to burst characters after the Durability Update, it's been long enough for us to be confident that Shadow Kayn is failing on most fronts to complete his main goal… killing his enemies. We’re returning some damage to his passive and giving him a little more sustainability with some Shadow Step healing. Changing Lillia from a ranged champion to a melee champion last patch greatly increased her synergy with Demonic Embrace, Conqueror’s, and Red Buff which resulted in her gaining a little more power than we expected. We’re pulling some of that power out in a way that should hurt her tankier builds a little more than her AP builds. Malphite has had a chip on his shoulder ever since we nerfed his waveclear by taking away his ability to rush Immolate. We’re adding some waveclear power back into his kit in a way that will reward tank builds without over-buffing his AP builds. Similar to other tanks, Maokai’s been missing Sunfire Aegis and Immolate which increased his ability to effectively clear minions and jungle camps. We’re putting a bit more clear power into his Q to help him find his spot in the jungle and top lane once again. Mordekaiser jungle appears to have been a big winner of patch 12.22 thanks to his passive. We’re dialing that passive down a bit by reducing his base damage to monsters and making it specific to large monsters so that it functions similarly in the jungle as it does in the top lane. Shyvana has been blazing through the new jungle thanks to the Preseason changes that made camps healthier and increased the damage output of her E. We’re taking down her maximum percent HP damage so she isn’t quite so oppressive against camps AND all the tanks seeing more play. Sion, like many other tanks that relied on Immolate for waveclear, is struggling to farm well in Preseason, decreasing his overall power. We’re giving him a bit more mana and Q damage to help him better match his opponent’s waveclear. Since her mid-scope update in patch 12.19, Syndra’s been slowly gaining winrate and popularity. While she's meant to be a powerful scaler, Syndra's mid-game waveclear and burst potential let her Transcend a bit too safely. We’re cutting back some of her long-range power with Scatter the Weak and shifting a portion of it into Force of Will. Now Syndra needs to be a bit more close and personal before disintegrating her enemies. AP Tahm Kench croaked a little when the Preseason changes made it to him, resulting in the Kench being downgraded to the bench. We’re giving him some buffs that should help his tank builds while also doing some followup buffs to his AP builds from a few patches ago. Trundle benefitted a bit too much from the preseason jungle changes, especially now that tanks are seeing a lot more play. We’re bringing down his clear speed to bring him more in line with other junglers while reducing his R percent health damage so he doesn't completely subjugate tanks. Yuumi has simultaneously been one of the most frustrating and most popular/played champs in the game. We think there’s a better place for Yuumi where we can deliver on her gameplay fantasy for her players while also making her less frustrating to play against. In this patch, we’re giving Yuumi a decently sized nerf to temporarily address some of her more frustrating features and curbing her power in both Elite and Pro play. However, we definitely don’t see this as the final, long-term solution for this champion. We’ve started work on a larger scale Yuumi rework to help this cat land in a much healthier spot. We want to highlight what Yuumi as an attached, untargetable enchanter can provide to her team. As an early goal, we want to limit her aggressive CC outputs/damage, emphasize more defensive/enchanter outputs, reduce her scaling, and make her more dependent on her own lane's success to win games. We’ll have some more news to share on this in the future, but for now we appreciate your patience as we work on Yuumi. Zac also made the list of champions that were nerfed now that they aren’t rushing Immolate. In order to add some goop back to this glob, we’re buffing his health scaling a bit to help him synergize better with some of the new Preseason tank items. Zeri's been a turbulent champion over the past year, with an electrifying kit, explosive pentakills… aaand a plethora of balance changes. We're taking one more big swing at our favorite lightning-themed Zaunite to address some issues that set her apart as the best marksman in Pro play this year. Zeri's combination of long range, high move speed, and scaling damage gave her little to no weaknesses in a coordinated environment like Pro play. We're shifting Zeri's playstyle by shortening her range so that she has to get up close and personal to make sparks fly and opponents die. This comes with revamped base stats, a higher damage Burst Fire, and an adjusted Spark Surge. So even though Zeri is being amped up, opponents should now have many more opportunities to catch lightning before it bolts off to safety. SPARKS READY! We’re introducing a few adjustments to help jungle companions scale better with tanks, while reducing the amount of gold they give to their owners, as junglers were often significantly ahead in gold compared to laners. Making a few follow-up changes to the Preseason jungle adjustments introduced in the last patch. Most of the communication tools that we’ve had in the past cater towards conveying personal intent, the ability to describe what you and you alone plan on doing. We introduced Objective Planning as a way for people to build alignment across the team as a whole. So far, we've seen that Objective Planning is allowing players to better align around whether or not to take an objective as a team. However, there are some situations in which the vote is showing up too frequently or at irrelevant moments. When it comes to objective planning, we want to make sure that we’re showing relevant information to players that can help them make better decisions at the right time. We want players to be able to communicate their intent clearly, whether it's being ready and prioritizing for objectives or actually using the tool for alignment. For now, we’re making some changes to have the voting system better match players' intent and will continue to improve this system as we learn more about how all of you are using it! As a special thank you to ARAM players everywhere, we’re going to be hosting our last Clash of the year on Howling Abyss! This Clash will be free-to-enter and feature an 8-team bracket where each team gets to play 3 matches. Each player will receive 2 rerolls per game, so make sure you use them all! Registration for this special, for-fun Clash will begin on December 5 and the tournament days will be on December 10 and 11, 2022. Players that participate will receive a limited-time, exclusive ARAM clash icon so make sure to mark your calendars! On a non-ARAM related note, Clash rewards for this year will roll out during patch 12.23, so keep an eye out! In this Mythic Shop rotation, we’ll have two Unvaulted Prestige skins, two Unvaulted Mythic skins, and a new Seasonal Mythic skin (with accessories). Similar to our End of Year Prestige Point shop, the Mythic Essence icons are returning alongside a couple of previously offered Grab bags. We want it to be easy to get to the fun of League without having to do a ton of research beforehand. So like we added item recommendations to the shop, we’re also adding a rune recommender in champion select! You can access it by hovering or locking in a champion and clicking the new icon next to the edit rune page button. We have a few more planned additions for this feature and will be keeping an eye on your feedback to improve it over the next few patches! Draft strategy is an important part of the game in queues that support drafting, so we want to make it easy for your team to optimize its draft for success. Currently there are a lot of opportunities for things to go wrong for players trying to swap their pick order — you have to communicate in chat with the person you want to swap with, have the champion that the other player wants, and then successfully trade champions before the game starts, all while preparing your rune and summoner loadouts. We’ll be streamlining this process by letting you swap pick order with the press of a button! We’ve heard feedback that with the only difference between ally’s names in champion select being the numbers 1 through 5, it can be difficult to tell who’s speaking, particularly when a lot of people are talking at the same time. So now you all get code names! End of Season Honor rewards including the new Honor level 5 Malzahar skin reward will be granted according to your Honor level at the End of Season. The ARAM AFK threshold has been changed to 120 seconds from 90 seconds. Improving usability around favoriting champions so that you can find them faster in champion select. As a reminder, you can right click champions in champion select to favorite them for a specific role!"
13.1,2023-01-10,"Welcome to the 2023 season of League of Legends! We hope you’ve been keeping up with the Preseason changes because the new season of League kicks off on January 10, and with it begins the Ranked climb! In this patch we have a few big changes to Ranked (like promos changing from 5 to 3 games), so make sure to check out the full Competitive section down below. In other news, we have some Preseason balance followup, a Jax midscope update, a Mythic shop rotation, and an adjustment to the refund token system included in this week's notes. Thanks for playing with us in 2023 and happy climbing! 13.1 brings the first balance patch for TFT's new set, Monsters Attack!, but it also brings their first-ever temporary game mode, a Lunar Gala event, and much more that you can read about with the TFT patch notes here! Midscope update. All abilities adjusted. Jax’s midscope update is on the smaller side compared to our previous onces. Overall, we like his simpler gameplay and kit, but we felt there was room to make his ultimate ability more interesting. Additionally, we’ve shifted his AP ratios around to buff up his burstier AP playstyle that’s seen play in the past. All of that said, unfortunately Jax still doesn’t have a real weapon… Aatrox has been bringing death to the top lane for a while now, and with Preseason shipped and the new season kicking off, now is a great time to address his strong presence in top. We’re tapping down his damage, healing, and move speed which should help bring the Darkin more in line with other top laners. Since his changes in the last patch, Dr. Mundo has been going where he pleases (top and jungle) and performing quite well there. Now that our changes have succeeded in pumping up Mundo’s tank scaling fantasy, we’re looking to reel in his power and avoid any potential malpractice issues… Since the durability and tank item updates, our premiere anti-tank skirmisher has been eating well. Her bonus-AD-hungry kit has better options against all foes with the new Ravenous Hydra. As the stars have aligned for Fiora’s success, we need to tap down the AD scaling on both her anti-tank and generic damage. Champions who can do too much of both can veer into the territory of becoming too strong, but we do want her to maintain her unique kit. Our eyes will be on the Grand Duelist to monitor these changes. Jayce has been keeping his distance recently. Mostly because he’s always in his cannon form due to its many advantages over the weaker hammer form. In order to help balance out his stances we’re buffing up the hammer form to give Jayce the opportunity to have more of those cool Arcane fight scenes. As players have become more comfortable and skilled on K’Sante he’s started becoming strong, which is par for the course. However, combined with his last buffs this pushed him a little too far in high skill brackets of play. We’re bringing his power down a notch before he starts to become particularly problematic. Lissandra has been underperforming across different skill brackets and lacking excitement for a while now. We’re making a few changes that should help her get more involved in fights, increase overall utility, and also synergize with her close combat style of play. Like Amumu and the jungle companions, Rammus found a new friend in Preseason by the name of Jak’Sho the Protean. The current synergy between Rammus’ W and Jak’Sho is being adjusted so that the two interact more cleanly with one another, but this should be roughly neutral. That said, Rammus is a bit too strong right now, so we are baking in a small nerf to his overall durability. Famously (or infamously), Shaco has quite a few builds he can kill you with, his AD build has fallen pretty low in terms of effectiveness. In this patch, we’re increasing its burst a little to keep it a viable build option. On top of that, we’re also bringing Q’s mana cost down which should help since AD Shaco doesn’t build any mana items. Really, we just want to see more of the clown in the game. All right, now you can go check out the changes. Our 12.23 buffs to Sion undershot our goals, partially due to the Q buff only affecting snapcasts of the ability. This round we’ll be buffing up fully charged Qs as well as increasing base durability to help give Sion the boost he needs to be more competitive. It’s been a long time since we last buffed TF and even then he hasn’t been lucky enough to be drawn in Solo Queue or Pro Play. We’re giving him a bit more freedom to let his cards fly wildly while putting a bit more oomph behind his Red and Blue cards so he can leave his opponents looking more black and blue. Xayah isn't quite up to snuff compared to other marksmen and her attack-focused builds are weaker than more casting-centric ones. A moderate increase to her overall attack speed should help with both of those issues and help Xayah find her wings in the bot lane. Yuumi is still terrorizing higher skill brackets of play leading to her current ban rate being higher than we’d like. In order to help get Yuumi out of the picture while we rework her, we’re tagging her Q with some pretty significant nerfs to reduce her powerful poke and make her less frustrating to play against. Zeri's rework has succeeded in shifting her to a new and healthier play pattern, but she’s been a bit strong in higher brackets of play since her changes in 12.23. Her shorter range brought in many new avenues of counterplay early in the game which was one of our major goals, but she's still a bit too consistent of a DPS threat at her three item power spike. As follow up to her changes in the last patch, we’re toning down her scaling damage a bit and hitting her favorite cat so Zeri is a bit less scary of a carry. Axiom Arc is a cool item but really only has one core user in Nocturne (and we love him for it). With a buff aimed at assassins, we hope that more players will be casting more ultimates so they can ultimately complete their anime protagonist arc. Horizon Focus doesn't receive too much attention outside of a few artillery mages… and it's not even that great on them. With enough Ability Power to now match Shadowflame, maybe you'll tell the shopkeeper, ""Bring me the Horizon Focus!"" To which they'll reply, ""That's the spirit!"" Jak'Sho has landed as a solid core item for tanks, however it’s also been quite potent on fighters. We’re ok with fighters sometimes purchasing the item when they want to lean more into durability over damage. But we don’t think it should dominate all the other Mythic choices they have, and right now it's close to doing just that. We're shifting the ratios on Jak'Sho to better incentivize additional defensive purchases and make it a worse one-stop shop for durability in fighter builds. Rod of Ages is still a bit weak after having its cost buffed and is missing the mark a bit when it comes to that classic RoA experience we all love and remember. We’re shipping some small buffs this patch aimed at the item's immediate power spike as a stat stick while also making the Move Speed more noticeable and effective. We’re also making adjustments to the Eternity passive as it's currently skewing too far towards taking damage (and restoring mana) versus casting spells (and healing). While functional, the current version of Seraph's Embrace hasn't been hitting the mark in terms of excitement and impact. With RoA and Catalyst returning, the healing effect has now become redundant. We tested a few iterations of this item in Preseason that didn’t feel quite right leading to the changes being delayed, so we’re excited to have reached a version we’re more confident in for live. We're shifting Archangel’s back towards a high AP scaling item with a defensive option to help mages have a little more room for error in the late game. With the avalanche of new and updated Preseason tank items, Winter's Approach has lost its place among the Legendary items (which is a shame because winter finally came). We're reverting some of our nerfs from last year so that Winter's Approach stands out more as the mana/health stacking second item. In its current state, Legend: Tenacity is a legendary source of Tenacity in the game. Especially when it comes to fighters where it’s the optimal rune in its row when running standard keystones. Currently champions are taking this rune into CC-reliant matchups as a way to avoid Merc Treads and invest into other stats. That, combined with the fact that Legend:Tenacity far surpasses Unflinching in terms of power meant that this rune needed a sizable amount of power removed from it. The 12.23 ARAM changes shook up the Howling Abyss and we hope you enjoyed testing them out in our first ever ARAM Clash! We're currently evaluating the tower rubble and other new changes, but for now will be focusing on addressing more immediate balance concerns this patch. The ARAM nerfs in this patch will primarily be to juggernauts and assassins, who are dominating the Howling Abyss at the moment. Many were given extra power to help them in the previous iteration of ARAM, so now that the map has changed we're reducing some of that extra power. Season 2023 - Split 1 begins with the release of Patch 13.1 in your region! Ranks have been reset, hit the Rift in Ranked Solo/Duo or Ranked Flex to begin your climb! We’re making some changes to how refunds work in League of Legends. For starters, every player should have their refund tokens refreshed up to the maximum amount of 3 to start off 2023. In the past, the complexity associated with maintaining this system has led to delays in the annual refresh, so we’ve opted to bring the entire League community up to 3 tokens."
13.1B,2023-01-24,"Happy (belated) Lunar New Year! Mark(smen) your calendars because patch 13.1B has tons of damage ADC adjustments! Due to the recent social engineering attack, League's Patch 13.2 will not be deployed on 1/24 as planned. Our dev teams have been working hard over the last couple of days and have a hotfix prepared to be deployed on Thursday (1/26) that will have most of the content for both LoL and TFT. We know this is disappointing but we believe we will have things repaired near the end of the week, which will allow us to remain on our regular patch cadence going forward. Again, there is no indication that any player data or personal information was compromised. Thank you so much for your patience and understanding. With that said, we’re one patch into the year and following up Preseason with some sweeping changes to marksmen, their items, and fighter items. We also have a few pro-skewed nerfs to address the likes of Lucian/Nami and Yuumi, Chemtech Drake buffs, new Lunar Gods skins, and an update to surrender voting. See you on the Rift! If ADC class adjustments are just too much to handle, you're welcome to cut class with the Gadgeteens wreaking havoc over in the TFT patch notes here! With the ADC changes coming this patch, GP’s going to strike treasure. To make sure his haul isn’t too lucrative, we’re preemptively nerfing him so that his endgame power will be roughly equal to what it currently is on live. After his creative genius captured the adoration of fans across the globe in the World Championship last year, Heimerdinger has been progressing in presence in high skill brackets and Pro play. Unfortunately, his genius plays currently lack sufficient counterplay. In order to reduce his powerful and frustrating bot lane we’re reducing his turret health and base rocket damage while buffing his AP scaling to maintain his viability in the mid lane. With Seraph’s Embrace being changed in 13.1, Kassadin has been having the time of his life. Unfortunately it’s time that came to an end, so we’re bringing his power down a tad to keep him in check. Kindred has been on the hunt and on the rise lately, but the fighter item changes are expected to impact them negatively while the marksmen changes will be overall very positive. We’re giving them a preemptive nerf here to keep Kindred power neutral compared to their state on live. Between her recent nerfs and the upcoming nerfs to Demonic Embrace this patch we want to make sure we don’t killia Lillia. We’re tuning up her AP ratios for the most part so she feels better about building and stacking more AP in her builds. Lucian and Nami are overtaking the Pro scene, which means we need to address them. Unfortunately, Lucian as-is doesn't fare too well in the hands of non-Elite players. We’re lowering his lane bullying potential (about 10% less mana at level 1) while making him more forgiving to play at later levels (more mana at level 11 and beyond) which should help address this disparity. Lucian is also expected to be a big winner from Essence Reaver's buffs in this patch, hence some preemptive nerfs. Overall, we're hoping for Lucian to be roughly the same after these changes for the vast majority of players while he should perform worse in Pro. Maokai’s current jungle power level exceeds what this patch’s nerf for Demonic Embrace will do, so we’re treeting him with some additional nerfs to bring him more in line with other junglers. Nami has been dominating in both solo queue and Pro play, so we’re reducing W and E’s flat damage while compensating W’s AP ratio to make her less of a lane bully and bring her into better waters. Orianna has been stuck as a mid lane understudy for a while now due to her ability to get wound up and take over Pro. It’s been a while since she’s seen the spotlight though, so we’re comfortable with giving her some measured buffs that’ll at least give her a shot at a starring role. With 13.1's buffs to Rod of Ages and Seraph's Embrace, it's no surprise one of the biggest benefactors was Ryze. With Seraph's and Catalyst returning to giving heaps of Ability Power and durability, Ryze is finding himself less blue (purple???)… especially in Elite and Pro play. We're tuning down how well his passive scales with Ability Power, which was buffed in a time where Ryze had much more limited access to his most important stats in items. In 12.23, we shifted the power from Udyr's Q into his other stances, but we overshot on the power of his R, so it’s now overperforming other rank-up options. We're reverting one of those buffs and expect his stances to be more equally viable with the additional Demonic Embrace nerfs coming this patch. We’re also slightly reducing the burst potential of his heavy AD builds, which are less powerful but still have frustrating levels of percent health burst when combined with early armor penetration. The magical cat's last nerfs reduced a lot of her power in solo queue, but still kept her at an uncomfortable level in Pro. With her current presence and upcoming ADC changes, we're going to be taking the last nerfs a bit further as we continue to rework her. We're limiting Yuumi's ability to effectively trade with her basic attacks and health pool, which has been a big factor in her Pro dominance. Since 12.10, Zoe is one of the few burst mages that hasn't been adjusted to new magic resist values, and her success in lower levels of play is suffering as a result. Zoe's all about getting ahead early and snowballing, but in recent times it’s been more challenging for her to find those kills early in game. So we’re giving her a small improvement that should keep her burst damage feeling powerful without making her feel overwhelmingly oppressive. We’re making some adjustments this patch that should help reduce some of the current frustration with fighters, namely the high levels of sustain and ability haste that the class has access to. To tackle ability haste, we’re separating it from most defensive items which should mean that a fighter will need to pick between ability haste and durability for their second item purchase, delaying some of their power into their third item. As far as omnivamp goes, we want to curb stacking sources of sustain to slow down heavy snowballing itemizations. We're aware that some of the currently underperforming fighters may fall behind without sustain or with longer cooldowns as a result of these changes. We'll be monitoring each champion affected individually, and will adjust where needed due to how many core items we’re changing. Grievous Wounds is a necessary effect found on mostly pretty weak items, leading to items that are both unreliable and unsatisfying when it comes to heal cut. We're buffing Grievous Wounds items, but not Grievous Wounds itself, with a couple main goals. First, we want Grievous Wounds accessible when you identify that you need it — not 2500 or more gold later. That means having component items that actually matter, not just finished ones. Second, we want Grievous Wounds items to make sense in builds, with reasonable gold efficiency. Third, we don't want you playing minigames to access Grievous Wounds - we want it to just work when you need it. And yes, it's perfectly ok to buy an Executioner's Calling or Bramble Vest and just sit on it while you buy other stuff if the game calls for it. For those interested in the numbers, a note on why we didn't increase the Grievous Wounds amount from 40% back to 60%. We need to tune healing numbers around what happens in-game, and Grievous Wounds scales very aggressively as the number gets higher. Healing output at 40% Grievous Wounds is half again higher than healing output at 60% Grievous Wounds... which sounds great, until someone gets a heal off when Grievous Wounds happens to have fallen off, and it ends up being unexpectedly huge. The stronger we make Grievous Wounds, the more large, unexpected burst heals you should expect to see in your games. While AD Carries aren’t strictly weak, League has gotten faster and most of their best items have been pushed later into their builds over the years. We’re adjusting Infinity Edge and Navori Quickblades to make them available as second items so that ADCs can access their most important power spike earlier in the game. For those who find their team comp lacks proper peel, we’ve also buffed opt-in durability with a cheaper, shieldier Bloodthirster. Finally, we’re alleviating late game mana constraints on several AD carries who frequently run Presence of Mind. These buffs should give those specific champions more room to run healthier options like Triumph or Overheal. These changes will certainly add power to ADCs overall but we’re hoping this has an oversized effect on making the role funner to play. Blade of the Ruined King was adjusted as part of the fighter item changes AND the ADC changes this patch, so the rationale for both of those changes extended to BoRK as well. Demonic Embrace is currently just a bit too good on melee champions and nearly non-viable on ranged ones. We think that Demonic should still be a strong item, just not simultaneously mandatory on some champs while being extremely weak on others. Essence Reaver is currently letting down the champions that want to build it most, so we’re upping its power a bit to be more in line with other itemization options. Leblanc has been one of the most heavily modified champions in ARAM, so we’re looking to see if helping her use her abilities more frequently but less powerfully helps mitigate some of the frustration of dying to what feels like two buttons while keeping Leblanc players satisfied when they execute their full combo. Since the ARAM updates in patch 12.22, we've heard a lot of feedback about pacing in game modes, specifically around Death Timers. We agree that these timers are too long (especially in URF), so we’re going to be testing out some changes to them. While this set of changes may not hit the sweet spot right away, we’ll be following up in future patches to get them to a better place and roll them out to other game modes. Chemtech Drake has been settling back into the Rift and is adjusting well, but is still a bit less powerful than the other drakes. We’re giving Chemtech some small buffs to make it feel just a little more at home."
13.3,2023-02-07,"Get ready for an out-of-this-world patch, because the stars have aligned and the Aurelion Sol CGU is here! But wait, there’s more! We have Ahri’s ASU for confirmed 100% fluffier tails (this is not a legally binding claim), buffs for a few struggling melee supports, nerfs to some popular items like Umbral Glaive and Radiant Virtue, sweeping Tenacity tweaks, and now you can surrender at 15 minutes if 4 of 5 players agree. As always, thanks for reading and see you on the Rift! Check out the TFT patch notes here! We’re working to bounce back from the Social Engineering attack, but unfortunately Patch 13.3 will be delayed. We’ll post details back here once we have a good understanding of when we’ll be able to roll out the patch. We apologize for the inconvenience and want to thank you once again for your patience as we work through these unprecedented circumstances. Thank you! Patch 13.3 will go live a day later than usual. That will be the morning of Thursday the 9th for all Riot regions, and the morning of Friday the 10th for SEA. Aurelion Sol’s CGU is here. We hope you enjoy his stellar scaling, new and improved abilities, and absolutely breathtaking ultimate! Aurelion Sol’s damaging Abilities break down enemies into Stardust, which improves his Abilities. We adjusted Amumu at the end of last season so the Sad Mummy could find some friends with the new jungle companions. However, he seems to have found a few too many friends in both jungle and support, so we’re nerfing him in both roles. Annie’s been struggling to pick up wins, even when she’s matched against opponents that she should have the advantage against. We’re giving one of League’s oldest champs some much-needed quality of life buffs to her Molten Shield and Pyromania passive, and bumping up Tibbers’ durability for late game fights. The intent is to buff Annie in ways that aren’t just her upfront burst damage, but we’ll be keeping an eye out to make sure these changes bring her power to bear. Golden Aegis hasn’t been the shiniest ability in League’s history (although the name may be misleading). Jarvan’s W has been intentionally kept a bit underwhelming as it has been a great defensive spell for low-economy junglers in pro play. However, since the Durability update Jarvan’s needed to fill the role of a relevant backline threat, so we’re beefing up his shield to reward his more AD oriented builds. K’Sante has too much CC right now, which allows him to lock down opponents too effectively, so we’re tapping down his numbers to make him a little less oppressive (these changes should also help make Tenacity more effective against the Pride of Nazumah). Lastly, we’re also dropping his durability when he goes All Out in fights to emphasize the need for him to isolate his enemies. Even after his nerfs last patch Kassadin continues to Kassawin. These nerfs are targeting two of his core strengths: his ability to trade effectively in the early game and his ability to spam his E in the late game. So we’re bringing down the power on both of these to help bring him back into line. Kayle’s been feeling a little less-than-angelic lately, so we’re looking to grant some skill-expression to make her stronger, especially in the hands of her mains. Shadow Kayn hasn’t been the terror in the shadows he once was, suffering particularly hard in lower skill brackets. We’re giving him a bit more AD scaling to support the arguably edgier version to Kayn without giving Rhaast too much power. LeBlanc has been struggling across all skill brackets, and now that she hasn’t been a constant Pro threat we’re comforting giving her access to a bit more mana throughout the game. This should help LeBlanc players find some wins in tougher lanes, snowball a few more games, and give her access to some more waveclear and poke. Lee Sin rarely gets to be strong in the hands of us mere mortals since his skill cap is so high. We don't want to lower his skill expression, so by granting him more damage in the mid game and a bit more utility late game, we're hoping he can find success even without 300 APM kick combos. Trundle hasn't really felt like the Troll King after various system nerfs indirectly affected him on top of other nerfs that actually directly affected him. So we’re reverting the uptime of his Frozen Domain so that he feels a bit more like his old self (but not his classic self), which should give him a reason to dance (which also got buffed). Zac has elastic slingshotted into a top tier jungler (and a few other lanes along the way). The recent Demonic Embrace nerfs brought down his power slightly, but he's still overperforming compared to the rest of the roster. We're reducing some of Zac's scaling damage as the game continues, so that he'll either have to rely on his teammates more for damage like other tanks, or be pushed into more greedier AP builds if he wants to start threatening squishier targets. Radiant Virtue is currently overpowered (even if pickrate isn't reflecting it) yet its strength isn’t really appreciable due to how unclear the item's best points are (because when you buy a strong item, you should feel strong). We're making Radiant Virtue’s upsides more apparent and impactful while removing some of the extraneous power that is pushing this item a bit too far. We feel enchanters already have plenty of defensive support options, while Radiant Virtue is meant for selfless tanks, who have fewer. So we’re tying Radiant's value more directly tied to tanks with the budget to acquire even more health. Umbral Glaive is currently much too effective at choking out enemy vision for assassins, supports, assassin supports, and especially marksman supports (stop killing my defenseless wards, Ashe). We do think this item deserves a spot on the roster though, so we’re reducing its uptime and general ability to devastate enemy traps and vision. Overheal changes were intended to ship with 13.2, but because we only micropatched with 13.1b this change was held back until now. Overheal is stronger for everyone and especially stronger for marksmen because the rune is weak and because players can hopefully opt into running it in games where they need that extra durability. Right now the Solo Queue meta is 2:1 ranged supports, which is just fine. But the Pro meta is more than 20:1. League is at its best when there’s a wide variety of champions to play and watch, so we’re buffing some melee supports to create some more variety in bot lane. We’re committed to keeping an eye on gameplay health for everyone in the game long term, so if we go too hard or too soft here, we’ll follow up as needed. Over the years Tenacity sources have increased dramatically. We want to streamline how these effects interact with each other as a cleanup to an old system and provide some clarity on which systems stack well and which don't. With these changes almost all Tenacity effects will stack multiplicatively (net weaker together) as opposed to the previous system where various systems sometimes stacked extremely well to nullify crowd control. Now that we’ve had a chance to let the preseason jungle changes settle into place we’ve gotten a more accurate picture of where the role currently stands and what still needs to be changed (as is typical with these large changes). Our main goals this time around is to bring down early ganking/diving power, shift some power from gold income to experience earned for junglers, and ultimately reducing early game volatility. This won’t be the last followup change we’re making to the jungle because we have a few bigger issues we’d like to address like early game agency (specifically for level 1-4), balanced champion sustain, monster durability, making sure we strike the right balance between kill rewards and farming rewards, and more. That said, we’ll only ship these if we’re confident they’re the best direction for the game. Treat income currently rewards champions that gank more than champions that prefer to farm. Ideally both playstyles are viable, so we’re tipping the scales to be a bit more balanced. Early vision has been proven to deter early ganks in the past, especially in high skill levels. While we don’t want to go back to giving teams permanent map visibility, we do think some extra vision early will help curb the amount of early ganks currently happening on live. Given that you’ll have 2 players in the bot lane, this should be a safe way to introduce more vision leveraging the duo lane’s unique strengths. With the same intent of deterring the large amount of early ganks we’re upping early tower damage so that the benefits of early dives also come with an appropriate level of risk. As a reminder, turret shots ramp up in damage by 40% per shot against the same target. Compared to previous seasons jungle companions are bringing a lot more burst damage into the game, particularly against epic monsters. This has caused situations where some champions appear from the Fog of War and their companions also appear and secure an accidental steal. We believe that securing epic monster secures and steals should be as intentional as possible, so we’re adding 1 more rule to the jungle to give some additional clarity. Due to the recent social engineering attack the first Clash tournament of the year has unfortunately been delayed. This means that the first Clash tournament will not be in mid-February as it has been the past few years and the rest of the Clash tournament dates are being impacted as well. We’re working to get Clash back up and running as soon as possible, and promise to give you a schedule within the next few weeks as soon as we can provide accurate dates. We apologize for the inconvenience and appreciate your patience in these unusual circumstances. Our data shows that comeback rates when a team fails a 4 of 5 early surrender (before 20 min) are low. Teams have a generally good sense of what games they will and won't win when 4 of 5 players are on the same page. We’ll be testing a change to surrender thresholds that let these matches resolve more quickly. At the same time, it's important that a winning team has time to feel powerful with a lead and games aren't abandoned too soon. We’ll be closely monitoring player feedback and the impacts of this change to make sure this change well. Removed the warning in Practice Tool for staying in the fountain too long (regular AFK detection still active) We’re shipping a few changes this patch that were intended to go live with Jax’s midscope update. These bugs were significantly more difficult to tackle than the usual ones so it took us a bit longer and required some dedicated focus time for our engineers to fix them. Here are a few highlights from the Bug Bash, while other tickets worked during this period can be found below in Bugfixes."
13.4,2023-02-22,"Launch sequence ready to begin. Rockets ready. Check. Engine on. Check. Slippery sea creature and shocked Yordle. Check? PATCH 13.4 IS A GO, LIFTOFF! We’ve got a doozy of a patch for you this week with 28 balance adjustments! In this patch all of the support gold income items get fine tuned, clear speed time is being slowed down a tad, Maokai gets his power trimmed, Thresh is getting hooked on a new skill level order, and Veigar (our favorite short king) gets some range increases on his abilities. In other news, we’re introducing the /muteself and /deafen functions, party chat, and finally increasing the amount of LP gained per win. But be careful, the amount you lose has increased as well. Looking to make some sick LP gains on the convergence? In that case, you should really check out the TFT patch notes here! While she saw a lot of time in the spotlight last season, Ahri disappeared when her mains needed her most, partly because of the nerfs she saw going into Worlds. Even after one buff she’s still having a hard time keeping up with her competition, struggling to find positive trades or use her Spirit Rush aggressively. We’re slightly increasing her base durability so she has an easier time in lane before roaming like the free fox she is. Despite our best intentions, Alistar lost out last patch. Turns out his teamfight healing is pretty important. For those of you who are fans of Wizard Cow, he doesn't appear to be very good as a mage and we're not intending for that to be the case any time soon. These AP ratio buffs are simply to make stat shards and other sources of Ability Power feel good. Amumu is an incredibly strong jungler, specifically in lower skill levels. His late game baseline power tends to disproportionately affect that bracket, so we’re looking to address that skill skew with these changes. His support gameplay will catch some stray nerfs here, which is fine since he’s also quite powerful there. Outside of one rather blue man, Anivia’s been one of the biggest winners from the Seraph’s x Rod of Ages buffs. She’s now getting much more value out of her newfound durability, thriving against shorter ranged targets. We’re bringing down her durability scaling a bit in exchange for the newly found durability in her items. This should help opponents punish Anivia more when her cooldowns are, well… down. Annie and Tibbers have made a big impact on the rift following their most recent gameplay updates. While we believe Annie deserves to be effective, she is overperforming relative to her peers in both Mid and Support, and could do with a little less power. We are aiming to bring down her base health pool to give opponents early counter-play, reduce her ambient damage from her shield, and limit the summon frequency of Tibbers now that he's more of a threat on the Rift. Aphelios’ big brain doesn't have quite enough wrinkles to find wins in solo queue nor enough fans in pro play. As such, Aphelios is receiving some relatively simple buffs. The choice of attack speed on his W rank up is to make the choice between attack speed and lethality a tight one, giving smart players one more avenue for optimizing their damage. After Kassadin and Ryze received nerfs earlier this year, Azir has become the go-to mid laner in pro play (imagine that), which is a throne the emperor has resided upon comfortably for years. These changes are meant to lower his oppressive early lane pressure and give him compensation that likely results in overall buffs in the hands of non-pros. Cho'Gath is a champion that has fallen behind in the meta due to his lackluster late game presence where his damage falls off significantly and his mana costs make it hard for him to stay out on the map after a single fight. These changes are aimed at relieving some of these issues and making Cho feel better to play. Elise has been lethal recently, and between her clear speed and potent first blood threat, she’s becoming the queen of the jungle instead of the queen of spiders. We’re reducing some base damage on her Q to curb first blood potential and tapping down spiderling damage to slow her clear a tad so she isn’t head and thorax above the competition. Last patch we gave Jarvan a shiny new AD ratio which did wonders for his W. Unfortunately it also pushed him into the top tier of junglers. While we like his shield having some real power, we’re rolling back a bit of the buff last patch so he’s just a bit less durable when he’s snowballing a lead. Jax is intended to be a late game monster, but his recent update made him a bit too strong during his laning phase, especially once he gets a point into his new ultimate. We're hitting his early game with a small nerf while leaving his powerful late game intact. We’re also adjusting his E so it's more rewarding with the more attacks you dodge. Malphite's sustained damage as a tank juggernaut is fairly underwhelming at the moment. So we’re aiming to keep his damage relevant throughout the game and allow him to have higher uptime on W for more powerful auto resets throughout a longer fight. Maokai is way too strong right now and incredibly frustrating with his sapling bombs which are meant to be zoning/vision tools, NOT damage ones. While AP tree is a compelling build, there's no risk to crafting a glass cannon when no one ever comes near to it. The Sapling cooldown nerfs will hit tank Maokai and he seems balanced at the moment, so we're compensation buffing Bramble Smash. Orianna is still stuck as an understudy after her last round of buffs where we didn’t quite go far enough to make the buff meaningfully impactful. We’re giving her a teeny bit more power in hopes that the ballerina can finally, once again, take her shot at the main stage. Riven is intended to be a very high mastery champion and we don’t think her current state is supporting a type of play that allows her to masterfully snowball her leads into wins. We’re getting rid of her atypical passive scaling to make it more early-skewed and less spikey, while letting her passive do a little extra damage to towers so she can be a more powerful side lane threat. Samira has been performing exceptionally well for several months now and her ban rate has skyrocketed. These changes are hopefully a win for everyone: those who are frustrated victims will be less frustrated and Samira mains will find she's still strong but actually available to pick! Everyone's happy! Senna has fallen behind in terms of strength and popularity lately and, on top of that, her core items are receiving nerfs this patch. These buffs aim to compensate for those power losses and give her some power in the rest of her kit. We’re buffing R’s cooldown and damage to make it more relevant as an offensive tool post-durability patch, and buffing Senna's attack speed ratio to promote her build diversity through Kraken Slayer. Q>E>W is Thresh's most popular yet least powerful skill build order. It's currently optimal to max W early and Q late. E is cool. Thresh is at his best when he's throwing out hooks, navigating short range combat, and overall controlling the battlefield (as opposed to primarily throwing out enhanced shields to his allies). These AP ratio buffs are essentially scaling damage buffs because he gets 1 AP per soul and these are here to give him some more choice in considering light AP itemization and runes. Since Udyr's VGU, we've spent quite a few patches working on the power balance between each of his stance maxes as well as his overall power. As a result, his winrates for different stances have fluctuated greatly, but his overall winrate has been relatively stable. Now that we're more happy about how each stance expresses power (Wilding Claw for AS/AD heavy DPS builds and Wingborne Storm for utility), we're taking a bigger swing at Udyr's total power level, which has been a cut above other junglers since Preseason. Veigar is a bit short on the winrate. While buffing his damage could definitely return him to his former glory, we want to avoid situations where Veigar outplays his opponents with a masterful Q+R display of skill. Instead, we're giving the immobile mage a bit more leeway when farming and poking around dangerous enemies. He'll still have to risk himself for big Event Horizons or Primordial Burst, but this should give him some nice breathing room in other situations. We’re buffing Viego because he’s the king. On a more serious note, Viego’s been struggling to find more than just love recently with his declining solo queue and pro strength. Now that he’s in a weaker spot, we’re comfortable giving him some measured buffs to bring his power levels up a little in a way that will reward higher risk/higher reward builds. Hail to the king, baby! Demonic has been a strong contributor for enhanced clear speed times, especially on the likes of a few top tier picks like Maokai, Udyr, and Amumu. We’re now capping Demonic’s damage against monsters so it isn’t quite as effective Doran's Shield is a very strong early game purchase for both tanks and fighters that makes a lot of champions feel less punishable than desired. This nerf aims to lower the passive healing without discouraging interaction based healing. Since the Durability Update, ranged supports have reigned supreme and melee supports have had to rely much more on finding early lane kills. Our goal with these changes is to even out the power of the two classes (alongside the champion specific buffs from 13.3) by more closely syncing the time supports get their ward upgrades and improving the balance of health regeneration and spell spamming in lane. Pro players are sometimes going Magical Footwear and selling the boots when they get them to use the gold to accelerate their mythic item purchases. This circumvents the original intent of the item (to grant you boots) so we want to bring down the power level of this particular strategy. Treasure Hunter is far and away one of the best runes to pick up in your secondary rune tree for almost all champions. It is currently contributing to a lot of early snowballing, so we’re taking away some of the gold that helped it become a top-tier rune. Shelly's range is fairly prohibitive for moving her into positions outside of the baron pit that you can use to your advantage. We're removing her soft reset state where when patience ends and she runs back and can be picked up by the enemy team, so now on contested Shelly’s you can disengage and not lose your objective instantly to the enemy team. Lord Gromp is currently so durable that he's very hard to counter jungle and his time tax on full clears is too high. We’re pulling down his durability a tad (which will scale his late game durability by even more). Early sustain in the jungle could use a helping hand, so we’re bringing it up just a tad. Remember, this is multiplied by up to x2.25 based on missing HP (which will happen many times in a clear). AP Junglers have a very generous ratio on their companion’s damage and now that the meta is dominated by these champions it seems that ratio is a bit too generous. Demonic Embrace after the changes to jungle HP scaling in preseason made it THE preeminent jungle clear item and put a lot of pressure on tank/bruiser junglers to purchase the item to clear effectively. It should still be a powerful spike for clearing and killing but shouldn't be quite so overbearing in the PvE aspects of the jungle compared to other options and builds. Early game League of Legends has become very snowbally. We're paring down early leads from kills so that when someone gets ahead early into a game they don't get so far ahead so fast. Especially in the jungle, kills could quickly swing players back into parity with opponents who are substantially ahead from other actions. Comeback mechanics in League are built to get you within a fighting chance of the opponent, but the comeback system on kills brought you up to their level. This shouldn't be a major shift to leveling in league but it should mean level leads are a little bit stickier. All ARAM Death Timers have been reverted to their 12.22 values. The first Clash tournament of the year is coming up next month! Here’s a look at the upcoming Bilgewater Cup dates: Party chat is a new chat channel that allows you to chat just to your pre-made party members. Chat channels indicate who will see the messages you send, which was previously limited to team and all chat. The chat console will now show the chat channels receiving your messages to the left of your chat bar. You can toggle between the different channels with commands or the [tab] key, and change which channels are active for you in your settings. For quick access to party chat you can use the /party, /pt, or /p commands. Incoming Party chat messages will be indicated with [Party] before the message. Party chat will be the default chat setting for new players. New commands for /muteself and /deafen are available in-game. We have seen players use the automatic chat abuse detection and muting feature in order to mute themselves, which is a misuse of that system. Given players do want to use this functionality, we are providing ways for players to mute themselves without needing to use inappropriate language to do so. In the 13.1 Patch Notes we mentioned that Refund Tokens would be deprecated due to internal technical challenges with supporting an older refund system. However, after some reassessment of the situation and a focused effort from our teams over the last several weeks, we’ve identified a path forward to maintain the refund token system that has been present prior to this year. We apologize for the mixed messaging, but ultimately want to thank you for your feedback on this. We also won't be backtracking on the 3 refund tokens that we granted to each player at the beginning of the season. As a quick refresher on the system: Players will accumulate one (1) refund token each year up to a max total of three (3) tokens per account. The same eligibility rules will apply and can be found in more detail on the support website. With the preservation of this system, this means the next token refresh will occur at the start of Season 14. Ranked progression at the beginning of a season starts out strong, but as it progresses it can become more difficult to see movement in your rank. We want to make it easier to move both up and down in rank so that your ranked journey is more eventful overall. Right now moving your rank can feel like pushing a boulder up a hill, so our goal is that if you have a solid session you’ll get to see your rank increase. Ranked hasn’t had large changes in a while now, so as usual, we’re open to your feedback and may make further changes down the road. If you want to learn more about the relationship between MMR and rank, check out this player support article. A duo in a match has more of an advantage over the solo players in their match than they should right now, so we’re making a change which should result in them being put in games with higher skilled players on both sides. We’ll continue to monitor and may nudge this value over the next few patches."
13.5,2023-03-07,"What’s up cool cats! It’s patch 13.5 and the cat’s out of the bag! In this week’s patch we have Yuumi’s much anticipated rework, several adjustments to Azir to help address his Pro skew, some buffs to roaming mid laners, and some buffs to counter jungling. In other news, we have some changes to ARAM including removing tower rubble, an update on the champion pricing changes, and an announcement about the depreciation of our 32-bit client. As always, thanks for reading and see you on the Rift! These aren’t the TFT patch notes you’re looking for? Well you can go check out the TFT patch notes here! Yuumi's rework is arriving in 13.5 with a few new spells, some cuddly VFX, and aims to address some core frustrations that have plagued our feline friend. The biggest change is to her Passive, Feline Friendship, which now builds a special bond with her teammates until one becomes her BEST FRIEND. This new bestie will then enhance Yuumi's abilities as long as she’s attached to them. Our goal is to make laning matter much more for Yuumi, especially if she is going to scale just as well as other enchanters while being untargetable. We've kept it as a dynamically growing bond because.... well, that's what cats do, but also in case something goes furociously wrong you should feel free to swap and not be hindered the entire game. Beyond her Passive, we've made a few more swaps to Yuumi’s abilities, such as making her healing more combat-based and her enchantments more Marksmen skewed. These should abate some of the high frustration moments when Yuumi can abandon her lane partner and follow powerful bruisers. While we're not pawsitive that this completely solves every problem for Yuumi, we hope this puts her in a better place for most players while making her less dominant in Pro environments. Aatrox was slightly overnerfed as a reaction to his dominance last season. We felt that his Q and E were relatively capped on power and didn't want to put strength back into those skills, so instead we opted to make his W scale into the late game better. As an important tool for catching enemies, the slow needs to be more powerful to pull enemies later in the game when movement options are faster and more plentiful. The R buff is another way to give some scaling power back into his kit as well. Ashe is a cool (ha) champion for solo queue and she's balanced in both ADC and support, even across MMRs. However, she's completely reigning supreme over all support picks in Pro play right now and her ban rate is rapidly climbing in solo queue as well. So here are some nerfs focused on Support Ashe with some compensation buffs aimed at ADC. Aurelion Sol’s made quite the impact with his CGU and we’re glad that so many of you have been excited to try him out! While he’s sitting at a relatively healthy spot in higher level play, his performance at lower skill levels is a bit too powerful. These nerfs should help curb his power just a bit to help address this skill skew. Azir is a pretty nifty champion and is exciting to watch. However, the vast majority of players, even in Challenger, don’t find appropriate success with him. Here's the rationale behind these changes: First, weaken his early game and give him compensation in the late game. Second, push him away from early Q poke and awkward soldier spam and raise his overall DPS otherwise. Third, update his base stats to bring back Nashor's Tooth as a viable option. Fourth, buff tools that especially help fledgling Azir players: more auto-attack damage in case his soldiers aren't in range and a stronger passive turret that's up more frequently so that Shurima's Legacy itself can protect him. It doesn't take an ace detective to see that Caitlyn is the queen of ADCs in Pro play right now. As the wielder of a sniper rifle, she's entitled to her long range and punchy auto-attacks, but only while they’re within reason. After these changes she'll be a bit easier to kill when caught and you’ll have a bit more time to find that opening. Fizz still hasn't found his land legs this season. While he performs adequately against most immobile mages, his more common AD matchups are having a field day bullying him. In these tough matchups, Fizz finds himself having to choose between using spells to dodge abilities or kill minions, but their enormous mana costs make each choice feel like a lose-lose. We’ll be increasing his mana in lane so that Fizz will have a few more casts of E - Playful/Trickster in lane, but he will still need to weigh the costs of wave clearing versus having kill pressure. Gangplank is currently in the top 25% of champions for ""Win rate loss due to low-mastery players trying and failing."" Thus, a balanced Gangplank is likely one who rests below 50% win rate until that trend changes. So let's talk tactics: Gangplank has armed himself with the newly buffed Essence Reaver and Navori Quickblades. Suddenly, he has very short cooldowns and no mana cost concerns. Accepting that these items are his core build now, he still needs to have appropriate downtime. In addition, now that he builds substantial AD and Critical Strike Chance, Trial by Fire is just dealing too much damage. Jinx hasn’t been popping off thanks to the IE or Navori second purchase changes, and her power isn’t quite up to par with her marksmen peers, so we’re comfortable giving her a little more oomph. These changes should help W feel more effective with only one point in it while the R changes are to help Jinx have a shot at those sweet cross map Baron steals. Kennen has been lacking an exciting mage feeling for a while now. Additionally, his farming, especially under turret, makes the champion difficult for players to pick up and find success. We also wanted to give Kennen players a range indicator on W to help clarify the range at which Kennen can hit enemy champions when they're marked, which should be especially useful when fighting near minions. LeBlanc's always struggled with a balancing act between clearing waves and assassination power. In solo queue, she boasts one of the highest average kills, but also has some of the lowest average minions killed. That means that players that can perfectly last hit with auto attacks and save their W for trading, get a much larger jump in power compared to other champions. This has resulted in LeBlanc being… well, not the strongest champion. We're aiming to smooth out her power curve so that if LeBlanc players want to guarantee some last hits, they're sacrificing a small cooldown without completely losing out on their Mana pool and lane pressure. Pantheon has been underperforming in the top lane lately, and his mid lane power has performed even worse. While we do support Pantheon’s ability to flex into mid, this round of buffs is intended to help his performance in top lane more. We’re also addressing some game health concerns around how much Pantheon can access his E in the late game when speccing into Ability Haste builds. Qiyana, like other roaming mid laners, has been struggling to find success recently. We’re introducing a bit more damage into her kit and some cooldown on her mobility spell so she’s able to move around the map a bit more. Rammus is still powerful after everything has shaken out in the jungle. We’re tapping down a bit of his damage so he's a little less of a murderadillo but still able to keep his core strengths intact. Rumble is very sad and definitely not overheating, especially in his primary role of top lane. He's historically been an early spiking champion whose entire power budget is wrapped up in his ability to win the first few team fights. This time we’re giving him some tools aimed at scrapping it out in the late game. Samira was nerfed in patch 13.4 as a way to address her early game snowballing and drain tanking. However, this nerf went too far and made her weak when she was supposed to be balanced. These changes simply walk back the severity of some of those nerfs. You still shouldn't have to ban her, but now Samira players should be able to enjoy playing Samira. Tryndamere has fallen a bit behind in terms of his power levels, but rather than buffing his early game, these buffs should help Tryndamere to scale better into the match with a bit more survivability and some harder hitting auto attacks. Oh, AP Twitch. You're one of my favorite champions. You're also overpowered. You're also INCREDIBLY frustrating to play against if you don't have to actually lane, since you can be anywhere at any time. At least Evelynn has to wait until level 6. That's the worst part of it, honestly. Back off of Evelynn's niche, you jerk. I'd say you stink, but you'd probably like that. Xayah’s buffs in patch 13.1 ended up going a bit too far, bumping her into the upper echelons of AD carries. Players are finally catching on to her soaring power levels, so she needs to be addressed. We’re happy with her higher attack speed, but she’s simply dealing too much damage right now. This patch we’ll be nerfing Yorick's uninteractive blast-you-with-ghouls playstyle so that being caught by one E with lethality builds doesn't end your life. This should bring down the overall power of this frustrating playstyle, but we’ll be keeping an eye out to make sure Yorick isn’t completely underground after these changes. In 12.23's hotfix, we hit Zed's late game E - Shadow Slash cooldown along with a few other nerfs to bring down his winrate and ban rate. These succeeded, but left Zed's late-game combos feeling pretty awkward and eliminated some of his cooler shadow shenanigans. We think his winrate is in a pretty good spot for a quick, combo-centric assassin, so we're adding a small nerf in exchange for reverting the original cooldown change. We experimented with junglers having advantages in their own jungle for clearing camps to disincentivize early counter jungling and keep newer jungle players from getting dominated from minute one. Early invades and steals are among the more miserable experiences in the role and a major contributor to players not opting into jungle. That being said, the costs to the rest of the game with respect to early ganking safety and some higher level strategy have seemed too high, so we're pulling this mechanic back. We’re glad we've explored this and we always believe it's worth trying changes that we think can help rather than being afraid of the potential downsides. We introduced the jungle treat system in Preseason, which was a large influx of gold into the jungle and pulled a fair bit of gold away from individual camps. This swung the meta heavily toward gankers, so we're compensating some gold back into camps now that we've drained some from treats. Junglers can get very ahead of their enemies by sapping early lane experience on ganks or when catching waves for dead allies. We think junglers who commit to early ganks should fall behind in experience to an enemy who is regularly farming, so this change should help reinforce that. Sweeping lens was a very powerful tool for clearing out vision and forcing enemies to play safe or risk dying to the enemy jungler. While this nerf will be felt more in the early game, it should also help tune down vision denial throughout the game as a whole. Cosmic Drive has been niche and unpopular for a while now. This stat change aims to make this item a more attractive purchase for damage-focused mages. Plated Steelcaps will now check for a much wider range of auto attacks so that when you bonk someone with a staff it really will be protected by Steelcaps. Seraph's got a breath of new (old?) life with the return of its shield and Ability Power, quickly becoming one of the most powerful mage items. As a result, most of the current meta mid-laners are those who can purchase Archangel's and use it to the fullest. We're doing a small efficiency nerf here to bring the outlier down a bit. However, our longer term goal is to increase mage item satisfaction and the overall power of the class by trimming some power from it’s stronger itemization options while simultaneously buffing its weaker ones. Healing from runes has crept up over time due to the durability patch last year and other system buffs like the updated tank items from preseason. These changes aim to slightly lower that ""invisible"" healing not coming from items. Grasp of the Undying has been benefitting fighters more than tanks with the power of its heal, and this change aims to lower the overall power of the heal component and increase the stacking tank stats to make the change feel less painful for its tank users. This Triumph change is meant to be a net nerf that flattens the extremes of the rune leading to slightly more healing when it matters less (high hp) and slightly less healing when it matters more (low hp) with an even breakpoint around the 35% hp mark. As a follow up to our /dev: State of Modes post, we’ll be making a few adjustments to ARAM this patch. In case you haven’t already, make sure to check out the full article here. First things first, we’re starting by removing the tower rubble from the Howling Abyss. Ultimately, we’re making this call because the rubble didn’t meet player expectations for what ARAM should be—a series of chaotic teamfights with non-stop action. Unfortunately, the rubble alongside the vision games it brought with it were just too much to be a healthy addition to ARAM, but we appreciate your patience as we tested it out! We’re also doing some work this patch to make Howling Abyss turrets a bit more lethal in the mid and late game as they haven’t been much of a threat recently. We’re also adding a defensive Inhibitor Turret buff which should help teams protect themselves against enemies taking two towers in quick succession. A quick reminder that the first Clash tournament of the year is upon us! Here’s a look at the upcoming Bilgewater Cup dates: In case you missed it, we announced that we’ll be altering our champion pricing structure this patch—you can read more details behind this change in the announcement post here. This update is scheduled to go into effect during patch 13.7, so plan accordingly! TL;DR: New champions will still be released at 7800 BE and 975 RP, and after a week they’ll be dropped to 6300 BE and 975 RP, and after seeing 2 seasons of play they will be dropped into one of the corresponding price tiers: AFKs are a common problem in League games, but our data shows us that most players who leave games do so infrequently enough that they don’t ever get a penalty. We know that sometimes disconnects happen, but we still want to ensure we still provide a reminder that leaving games always hurts your teammates. For more information on how leaverbuster works check out this article. We are continually updating and revising our systems to improve your experience in-game, so we’ll be keeping an eye on this addition as it rolls out. Support for 32-bit Windows OS will be deprecated on April 4, 2023. After this date a 64-bit version of Windows will be required to play League of Legends and Teamfight Tactics. For more details, please see our minimum spec requirements. “What does this mean?”, “Do I need to do anything?!” Well for those who are already on 64-bit operating systems and hardware (which is 99.9% of players) you won’t notice a difference when we stop supporting 32-bit and you won’t need to do anything. However, for those that are playing on a 32-bit operating system, starting in 13.7 you’ll start to get a message in the client telling you that the client may stop working in the future for you. We’re giving some time to message this heads up before we fully stop supporting 32-bit operating systems both in the patch notes and in the launcher, but in the future you’ll need to be playing on 64-bit capable hardware, and 64-bit operating systems in order to keep playing League. Why is the League team doing this? As with other decisions we’ve made in the past like deprecating XP and Vista, continuing to release new content while maintaining older hardware requires significant investment both from a development and a testing standpoint. By removing some of these barriers, we can continue to push the boundaries of new features while delivering engaging player experiences. While we don’t have any direct targeted improvements to communicate to you just yet regarding this migration, it will be something that leads into our continued investments in the future of League. Dodge penalties are increasing proportionally to the LP increases in patch 13.4."
13.6,2023-03-21,"Setting ablaze the hearts (and autos) of his allies while giving his enemies headaches, Milio “the Gentle Flame” gives a whole new meaning to the term friendly fire with his release this patch! But wait, there's more! We also have quite a few changes aimed at addressing the current early game bot lane skirmish meta with adjustments to ADCs and Drakes, a stunning new skin line thematic, a vaguely worded update on blind pick, and a new Mythic shop rotation! As a reminder, this is the last patch that League and TFT will be playable on a 32-bit client, so make sure you move to the 64-bit version. Milio's smile may be worth a Milio-n bucks, but TFT's got a new mid-set sure to give him a run for his money! Read all about it in the TFT patch notes here! Get ready to go on an adventure with Milio and his fuemigos on March 22! Last patch, Ashe was nerfed for support and the goal was to preserve her power level as an AD Carry. We were mostly successful in hitting these goals, but she's still a bit worse off. So here's us making good on that promise. Aurelion Sol is getting a lot of attention, both positive and negative—which he's pretty used to given the gravity of his stellar personality. We're aiming to lessen the frustrating moments he can create like his ability to stall/freeze waves for extended periods of time and reduce the potency of his teamfight wombo combo. The good doctor has been feeling a bit under the weather early game, but on the other hand he turns into a surgeon of death come late game. We're tuning Mundo in a way that should help smooth out his power curve throughout the game, while also giving him some medical tools to help him in the jungle. Galio's been stuck in limbo recently, and not the fun party game kind. After patch 12.10, he doesn't deal enough damage to threaten carries by himself, but he's also not durable enough to survive for multiple spell rotations. As the Colossus of Demacia, we'd rather buff up his beefiness than make him a burst mage. So we're upping his durability and Justice Punch uptime so that he finds a little bit more utility after the laning phase. Talon currently struggles to interact with the minion wave in oppressive mid-lane matchups a little too much. These changes should allow him to have more mana to farm with his Rake from a distance while helping his passive damage with base power and ratio buffs. Jungle Talon has fewer mana issues, so this shouldn't affect him as much. Vayne's been struggling in all skill brackets recently for a few reasons. Her passive hasn't stood the test of time against more mobile champions, so we want to give her some more chase potential while allowing her to use her Q more defensively. We're also giving Vayne a bit more AD scaling on her Q to support her more AD-focused builds which have been weak since critical strike chance was removed from Vayne's Q. However, we want to curb her potential power in the top lane, so we're bringing down her percent health damage as well. With great range comes great responsibility power. Veigar is standing tall in mid lane, but even taller in bot lane. With his huge spike in popularity, he's actually become a relatively common bot laner with extremely high win rates. Unfortunately, we can't have him be head and shoulders above the competition, so we're cutting him down to size by reducing his early all-in power, which is much more consistent when paired with a support. Yuumi's rework in 13.5 came out on the powerful side. While she lost a lot of offensive threat, her poke and burst survivability made it unclear what opponents could do versus a Yuumi and her Best Friend. Final Chapter's bonus resistances, which were added to make Yuumi feel a bit safer on less durable carries, ended up removing a clear point of weakness. We're removing the bonus effect and will be monitoring how players on both teams feel when interacting with the cat and her crew. The 13.1 micropatch gave ADC players a nice shot of excitement with some stronger defensive tools plus earlier access to Navori Quickblades and Infinity Edge. Turns out, earlier access to incredibly strong items is a simple recipe for ""overpowered role."" You've had your fun, fellow ADC players. Time for the nerfs we all knew were coming. Bloodthirster is meant to be an opt-in defensive option for when you really need the added durability. It's not meant to be rushed so that your ADC can become a tank before everyone else gets their builds online. A flat nerf, especially in the early game, should push Bloodthirster back a slot. Continuing on the past few buffs to mage items, Nashor's Tooth is up next. The item previously represented a complete package for Attack Speed Mages, but that was lost when Mythic Items were meant to be the new first item purchases. While the group of champions this applies to is pretty small, we've adjusted our mindset to be more open to first item Legendaries (see Tank items and Blade of the Ruined King), so Nashor's is being adjusted to fit better in that space. Navori Quickblades is the best-performing ADC capstone by a small amount. The fact that it's out-DPSing Infinity Edge due to resetting auto attack self-buffs makes it hard to pick anything else. So, lowering that reset should make the comparison a bit more fair. Bloodline is the most-picked ADC rune in the Legend slot by far and is contributing to ADCs being generically tanky instead of opting into durability when it's needed. The rune is meant to be a choice, not automatic. Similar to Bloodline, Lethal Tempo is the most-picked rune for ADCs by a long shot, which makes it a good target for removing power from the role at large. There are some champions where they'll never give up this level of attack speed and that's understandable, but for everyone else, there's more than just one viable keystone out there! In patch 12.14 we buffed the rewards for killing drakes to incite some early game action after the Durability Update. The changes achieved this goal, but put more importance on the bottom half of the map, especially during laning phase. With the recent changes to bot lane, it's almost always correct to only focus attention on the dragon and bot lane. We're moving the dragon rewards of the stronger buffs (namely Hextech) back to a value between 12.13 and the last patch. These aren't massive shifts to the power of the objective, but are meant to combine with general bot lane nerfs to make the game feel a bit less decided based on the state of the bottom half of the map. For 13.6 we're looking to clean up unnecessary modifiers by reducing them on champions that are performing well, and on champions that are underperforming. We'll also be reducing turret durability since game length is currently too high. As a reminder, the Bilgewater Cup Clash continues this weekend! In observance of Ramadan and the Iftar meal, Clash lock-in times will be made earlier for these servers: Warning! Large amounts of instability have been reported in this week's patch. We've managed to contain it, but only time will tell. As of now, this instability continues to build and current poro experts estimate we will reach critical levels late March 31st. The League Dev Team believes that if we reach critical mass, the event will be contained to Blind Pick and will likely pass in a couple of days, but it may be highly unusual. Firsthand reports and documentation are essential if anything unusual to prevent future issues, so if any brave souls wish to challenge Blind Pick from April 1st to 3rd, please help us by spreading the word. Godspeed and good luck. Bystander Feedback Reports: Players who were in a game where they were exposed to disruptive behavior, but did not report themselves, will receive a notification to inform them that we took action. We know that even if you don't report, disruptive behavior harms your experience. We want to encourage players to report when they experience disruptive behavior and provide more clarity on what we consider unacceptable behavior in League. We're generally happy with how the LP gain changes have been going, but we have some small follow up tweaks to make the experience even more smooth. As a reminder, support for 32-bit Windows OS will be deprecated on April 4, 2023. After this date a 64-bit version of Windows will be required to play League of Legends and Teamfight Tactics. For more details, please see our minimum spec requirements."
13.7,2023-04-04,"Hear ye, hear ye! We’ve successfully managed to reduce the influx of poros (and hats) that tried to take over the Rift this past weekend. We hope you enjoyed the shenanigans while they lasted! Without further ado, let’s get to patch 13.7. This patch is addressing quite a few popular junglers in professional play like Vi, Sejuani, and everyone’s favorite monk, Lee Sin. We’re starting balance work now to get the meta in good shape for the 2023 Mid-Season Invitational, which means knocking top tier picks down a few pegs. You can also expect some more pro-oriented buffs coming in the next few patches. But it’s not all about MSI! We also have some other changes this patch like making Rammus a bit softer, bugfixing Kha’Zix, and a new batch of April Fools skins. The next Clash Cup is also around the corner this weekend, and as a final reminder, all 32-bit clients will no longer be supported as of April 4 when patch 13.7 rolls out, read more details further below. And last but certainly not least, the Season 2023 Split 1 End is coming in 104 days, so I hope your climb is going well. Have you had a chance to check out the new TFT mid-set yet? If not, you can take this portal to get up to speed on the latest TFT patch notes here! Alistar is a big, beefy support that likes to charge his enemies and toss them up into the sky. As other squishier champions have come to fill similar roles, we want to make Alistar a bit better at doing what he loves: milking his enemies for gold. These base health and armor changes should give him even more beefiness and the ability to brawl harder in the early game. Annie has been burning her enemies in the bot lane with her updated Molten Shield. Maxing shield as a support makes sense for its defensive capabilities, but it also gives Annie a considerable amount of reflection damage and a cheap way to quickly build up her stun. We still like the idea of Annie helping out her allies, but we're bringing the choice between supportive and carry outputs a bit closer. Please max W now. There are three goals with these changes: First, strongly signal to players that W max is the way to go. Seriously, W max is currently the overall stronger build for Azir and makes for a much easier to balance champion long term. If he's not forced to be balanced around pro play with unending poke in lane, then he has room for a lot more power in the hands of a lot more players. This patch contains that power. Please max W now. Second, there are a few edges to sand off: Currently Azir Q can hit an enemy while still being out of auto-attack range, meaning right clicking after Q can make him walk forward. This is still a direct nerf, of course, but a pretty small one as the ability currently has around 1200 units of reach, which is going down about 4%. His passive Sun Disc summoning range is being increased to match his would-be attack range against a living turret and the duration of that Sun Disc is going up to keep it from falling over quite so quickly while he's still standing beside it. Also, please max W now. Third, there are some direct buffs: A modicum of armor should help him in a very AD-heavy solo queue environment… provided he doesn’t take over top lane, which we’ll be keeping an eye on. The attack speed growth allows him to match his prior levels of attacks per second from W's passive stats, while still enjoying the higher damage per hit from 13.5. This should make Azir a great high-DPS soldier commander while retaining the gains made from taking away his poke identity. The goal of these changes is to add more power to his W max build. If this list overshoots that goal, there are likely to be some nerfs coming his way. In summary, please max W now. Graves' critical strike builds were nerfed back in patch 11.22, and haven't really recovered since the Durability Update, where he's found a home in extremely durable builds (and a certain glaive). We want to open up more creative builds for him while giving him a bit of a damage and utility bump with a higher uptime on Collateral Damage. Kalista has frequently been a pro-bound champion but hasn't seen much play so far this year. So we're being very cautious with giving her some power heading into the Mid-Season Invitational. Additionally, some tweaks to her Oathsworn Bond ceremony should let the two of you get onto the Rift a bit sooner than before, which isn't meant to be a significant change in power per say, but should still feel better. Katarina's various builds require some re-tuning occasionally. We are giving AP builds a slight buff so they stand clearly above the other builds as her primary playstyle, and also buffing the AD+AS builds as those aren’t performing well at the moment. Kha’Zix hasn’t had the sting he once had, often relying on his W spam poke-and-catch fighter builds to find success. We want to make sure that Kha’Zix, with any of his builds, is actually able to jump on isolated enemies and kill them. His isolation mechanic is too skewed toward enemy counterplay so he has very little leeway on it proccing, so we want to make it a bit less punishing for Kha. (Note: a lower isolation range requirement means the enemy is substantially more likely to be isolated and is a buff). We expect fighter Kha’Zix to remain powerful, but these changes should make all of his builds more competitive. It's not clear how much power these isolation changes pack, so we’ll keep a close eye on them and adjust as needed. You’ve seen Lee Sin on the biggest stages like MSI and Worlds. It’s no surprise that he’s a favorite jungler at the pro level. But we don’t want him to be so strong he overshadows all other viable junglers. At this point in time Lee’s early game power is what’s pushing him into the top tier, so we want to bring them down just a tad. Olaf has been at the top of the top lane food chain for about 3-4 patches now with his win rate sitting at a stable 52-53% according to our data. His early Q damage gives him the ability to run down lane opponents who try to interact with the wave and win almost every trade due to the high base damage and cooldown refresh. This change is meant to lower early Q power. Olaf's passive also plays into this early game dominance, so we’re adjusting the attack speed portion at early levels to be less powerful. Rammus has been a high win rate champion for about half of all players over the last several patches, which is just too high for a champion to reasonably maintain. We can’t let this roll anymore. Tactically, we’re tuning his late-game power, which tends to most strongly affect the outcome of his games. Sejuani is a very safe early pick for pro play since she brings a lot of utility to the team and synergizes well with melee carries like Sylas, Jax, Fiora, and so on. She does a little bit of everything too well, so we want to reduce her ability to quickly clear objectives with coordinated melee teammates and to increase her overall down time with nerfs to Q and R cooldowns. This way, Sejuani will need to be more committed when she decides to engage with her high cooldown abilities. Patch 13.4 gave Thresh a lot of changes and has support players around the world hooked on Death Sentence. Unfortunately, his opponents have also been hooked on Death Sentence far too frequently. Recently it’s been too easy to lock an opponent down in a chain-CC combo with no chance to escape, so lowering the refund here should give opponents more opportunity to slip out between Thresh’s Q casts. Veigar has been strong in the bot lane for a very long time because his relatively bad wave control and good gank set up fit better into the duo lane dynamic than mid. However we still feel most Veigar players want to play him in mid, and we want to support that as his primary role. We are taking this opportunity to nerf him in a way that pushes his scaling to be more level dependent, which biases towards solo lanes. Vi is currently beating up the pro play scene thanks to her ability to build tanky and still deal large amounts of damage. Our goal with these changes is to bring the damage down on her tankier builds and shift that power into AD ratios to reward those Vi AD stackers out there. Wukong jungle hasn’t been monkeying around in pro play and solo queue. In this patch, we’re looking to tone down his early game pressure by reducing his base damage and his clear speed that comes with his E. We’re also lowering the incentive to max W second, as it currently gives a lot (10 mana less, 2.5 seconds less) per point. After the marksman item adjustments we introduced back in patch 13.1b, Yasuo fell behind the power curve and got the wind knocked out of him. These adjustments should help him get some wind behind his sails which should help him find some more flow. Zeri's been a mainstay of the Marksmen meta throughout the year, and finally has risen to the absolute top with buffed items and nerfed competition. With the newfound durability in her runes and Marksmen items, she doesn't need as much innate durability. We’re also zapping some of her guaranteed burst damage, which is uncharacteristically high for a hyperscaling DPS champion. In patch 13.1, we did a large pass on Fighter items in an effort to sharpen each item's choice and generally reduce unneeded Ability Haste. Death's Dance took one of the hardest hits when we introduced these changes. With subsequent changes to Marksmen and Seraph's Embrace/Rod of Ages, Fighters have struggled when on even footing in duels (and especially teamfights) versus classes they once bested. We’re reverting Death's Dance to give fighters slightly more power in elongated fights but still keeping the tradeoffs in reduced haste compared to Black Cleaver and Ravenous Hydra builds. Catalyst of Aeons, in its current state, is significantly cheaper than Lost Chapter which has turned it into a dual threat. Not only is it the preferable scaling item, but due to the lower cost it has become a better laning phase option than Lost Chapter which seems counterintuitive for a scaling item. This adjustment should help make itemization choices for mid mages a bit more competitive. We felt it was counter-intuitive that these items did not apply their unique effects to damage shielded enemies, as this is inconsistent with other ""on damage"" effects like Liandries. (Note: this change will apply to Oblivion Orb, Morellonomicon, Chemtech Putrifier, Executioner's Calling, Mortal Reminder, and Chempunk Chainsword.) For patch 13.7 we'll be trying out a few targeted nerfs on some of the best performing Champions in ARAM. They are especially powerful on Howling Abyss due to them getting tremendous value out of specific (and potentially frustrating) parts of their kit on the smaller map. The Clash Mt. Targon Cup kicks off this weekend! In observance of Ramadan and the Iftar meal, Clash lock-in times will be made earlier for these servers: Paying attention to the minimap to see your teammates’ pings while focusing on gameplay can be difficult. And actively aiming/dodging a skillshot can make this even more challenging. To help, we are introducing off-screen pings to give you easier visibility of your teammates’ pings. Some pings that are off-screen will now show up on the edge of your screen, and our hope is that this allows players to be able to react to pings faster than before. We're rolling out improvements to our disruptive behavior detection systems that detect verbal abuse and intentional feeding. That means you'll see increased actions taken against players for these behaviors in-game. You can now see your friend’s challenge data on their profile card! We’ve tested lower surrender timers in normals for several patches now, and the impacts have met our expectations: slightly increased surrender frequency leading to slightly lower average game times. We believe this change is right to allow teams more agency in choosing which matches to play out. We’ll be running an experiment in Normal Draft in EUN, OC, and RU during the 13.7 patch cycle, specifically to test some of our functionality around matchmaking for the upcoming Quick Play queue type. For these regions during the testing window, the changes will be as follows: Support for 32-bit Windows OS will be deprecated on April 4, 2023. After this date a 64-bit version of Windows will be required to play League of Legends and Teamfight Tactics. For more details, please see our minimum spec requirements. “What does this mean?”, “Do I need to do anything?!” Well for those who are already on 64-bit operating systems and hardware (which is 99.9% of players) you won’t notice a difference when we stop supporting 32-bit and you won’t need to do anything. However, for those that are playing on a 32-bit operating system, starting this patch you’ll receive a message in the client telling you that the client may stop working in the future for you. We’re giving some time to message this heads-up before we fully stop supporting 32-bit operating systems both in the patch notes and in the launcher. In the future, you’ll need to be playing on 64-bit capable hardware, and 64-bit operating systems in order to keep playing League. Why is the League team doing this? As with other decisions we’ve made in the past like deprecating Windows XP and Vista, continuing to release new content while maintaining older hardware requires significant investment both from a development and a testing standpoint. By removing some of these barriers, we can continue to push the boundaries of new features while delivering engaging player experiences. While we don’t have any direct targeted improvements to communicate to you just yet regarding this migration, it will be something that leads into our continued investments in the future of League. We’re happy to share that Showcase Milestones will now have an autoclaim feature that will run after each Showcase ends, starting with Broken Covenant. After the Broken Covenant Showcase ends on March 30th, the autoclaim tool will run on April 1 to grant any rewards you may have forgotten or didn’t have time to claim. In addition, if there were Showcase rewards you forgot to claim in the past (Eclipse Knights, Ocean Song, Space Groove), we will also be running the autoclaim for those rewards around the same time as Broken Covenant. This process will also persist for future Showcases. As with any new feature, we will be monitoring the accuracy and performance, so we’d like to advise that you still claim your rewards prior to the Showcase ending as the default behavior in order to avoid any errors in the near term. NOTE: This does not apply to Masterwork Milestones since that track does not deactivate or expire. This also does not apply to the Event Pass Milestones since you are required to claim and use the Event Tokens prior to the Event Shop closing."
13.8,2023-04-18,"Get ready, it’s time for the Mid-Season Invitational patch! Thirteen teams from all around the world will battle it out for the title of MSI Champion on patch 13.8 starting on May 2, so make sure to mark those calendars! We're also shaking things up with a new format for the tournament, so get ready for some intense competition. In case you missed it, you can check out the new MSI format here. For MSI we’re focusing on introducing more champion diversity into pro play. This is coming in the form of buffs for some under-utilized champions like Ezreal, Leona, and Lillia, while we address some of the overperforming picks like Jarvan IV, Malphite, and Rakan. But that’s not all! We also have some QoL improvements to Challenges, a new set of Night and Dawnbringer skins, and last but certainly not least, we’re introducing the ability to report players from your match history. These aren’t the patch notes you’re looking for? Well you can check out the TFT patch notes here! Legend has it that Aurelion Sol is still scaling, especially in non-elite tiers of play, so we need to bring this space dragon down to Earth (Runeterra?). We want to maintain Aurelion Sol’s current damage levels, but these changes should balance out his damage with squishiness, leaning into him being more of a glass dragon. The current bot lane in pro play likely has a hyper carry on both sides of the Rift and hasn’t allowed for many non-hyper carries to compete. We want to give Ezreal a little more “OOMPH” in order to shake up the current bot lane situation, but also to make him better at playing into scaling marksmen at all levels of play. Garen hasn't been living his best spin-to-win life recently, meaning he hasn’t been able to win early trades against other melee champions which is supposed to be one of his strong points. We’re buffing up his base damage and early durability to help him find his groove again. In this patch we’re giving Janna some ability to get a little more aggressive in lane and provide additional damage with her items. Also making shielding early a lot less punishing for players who want to preempt their teammates to go in for trades with E. Ever since the W buffs, Jarvan has been excelling in Solo Queue. He has always been a strong early ganker, but now he can build damage and reliably transition his lead due to the AD ratio on his W. We’re looking to tone down his power in a way that still incentivizes him to build AD, while also reducing his early gank strength since he now scales a lot better with items. Shadow Assassin Kayn stands above many junglers in terms of win rate and ban rate, especially in Eastern regions. We’re trimming the uptime of his Shadow Step to make him a little easier to punish. We adjusted Kha'Zix last patch to ensure that his Isolation passive wasn't working against him too much and we're happy that he's much more able to isolate and kill enemies. We weren't certain how much power that change would be so we went light, and now that we're certain we can give him a bit more power in early game clearing and scrapping. The Void Puppy is in a rough spot, being an immobile carry whose gameplay pattern revolves around one ability. Recently, we've focused a lot of attention on pulling/pushing the power in Bio-Arcane Barrage when changing Kog'Maw. We think Kog'Maw has more to offer than being a one-button pony, so we're buffing up his other abilities so that he's a bit more free to use his spells meaningfully before he focuses on solely auto-attacking late-game. Leona is another champion who’s been struggling to find her place on the Rift, often being eclipsed by other engage supports. In order to promote some more diversity in the bot lane, we’re upping her durability and damage so she can shine just a little bit brighter. In an effort to create more diversity in champion picks at the Mid-Season Invitational, we're buffing a few damage-reliant AP junglers in order to bring a different type of champion into pro play viability. There are a few interesting things going on with Lillia currently: She's got a pretty welcoming theme for newer players, but her jungle clear requires strong kiting in order to come out with enough health, so we’re amping her early jungle safety. On the pro play side of things, her clear speed is the most important lever. On top of those changes, we're taking the opportunity to ensure that AP items contribute more meaningfully to her in-combat healing, instead of it being generically available regardless of build. We'll cut the rock puns for now, Malphite's been more than just a solid top laner since his buffs in 13.4. The cooldown and damage buffs to Thunderclap greatly increased his ability to trade and push waves at near-infinite uptime come late game. Malphite could use some added weight to his abilities late game, but the amount of damage he delivers is on the high end for a tank, especially when maxed first. So we’re reeling in his damage a bit and hopefully evening out Malphite's skill ordering. Nidalee gains around 6% win rate as MMR rises and is balanced around elite players. As a result, she performs poorly in the hands of most players. While part of this win rate loss can be explained by champion mastery, her extreme early dominance and required snowballing is also partly to blame. However, giving her a strength other than “snowbally early game jungler” is a pretty large task. Our goal here is to ease up her early clear slightly, making her more durable in the hands of players who haven't mastered her clear yet. Additionally, more durability should help her better pounce in for takedowns. Poppy has seen better days, and she hasn't excelled in any of her roles for a while. We’re looking to give her some bulkiness later in the game that'll help her better dive into fights and skirmishes. Rakan's win rate and presence have been ramping up since 13.3's buff, especially in the higher-skilled bracket of play. Like Xayah, we love his versatility and general shape, however, it's time to put him more in line with other support champions by making him a little more vulnerable when he’s missing his spells, while keeping those button presses fun. The Cosmic Drive stat shuffle made the item a bit more popular. This change aims to lower the barrier to entry of the passive portion of the item and make it more broadly accessible to mages by removing the old passive and replacing it with a new one. By moving the passive AP into the base stats of the item, the skill test of this item is being reduced so players aren’t burdened as much about sequencing their abilities for the offensive payoff of the item. As a reminder, the Mt. Targon Cup Clash continues this weekend! In observance of Ramadan and the Iftar meal, Clash lock-in times will be made earlier for these servers: This patch includes a visual update for the Challenges Page! Previously everything was sorted by individual challenges which could be a bit confusing, but now Challenges will be organized by Capstone and Groups which should make them easier to navigate."
