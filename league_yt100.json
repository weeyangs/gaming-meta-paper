make them work they are showing the true potential of these Champions this is probably what's going to be the meta as well most of these Champions you might see picked at MSI even though we are doing a video for 13.9 really not many of these Champions have been nerfed in 13.9 so you will see them played by the top teams at that event and yeah without further Ado let's get into it well there is further Ado actually because I just want to talk to you guys about the website guys I'm back uploading daily videos to the website and let me put it this way if you don't climb the Challenger like all of you I'll be amazed now of course not everyone is going to climb the Challenger I understand that but if you don't climb divisions in tears just from watching like 20 minutes of the videos I'm putting on there they might be like reviews of my coaching sessions they might be like breakdowns of the top players in the world going at each other they might be Champion courses and guides which a bunch of our other Challenger players and coaches are uploading on The Daily like we have so many learning resources for you it really is just a buffet so make sure you check out thegameleep.com links description comment section click on them to get exclusive access to our library our content now the top 10 Champions according to Challenger and career we're going to start at number 10 of course with Elise s plus two Champion I mean it's all up yeah 54 and a half percent win rate for the Spider Queen look at this in close to 300 matches this is pretty impressive stuff now a pick rate isn't really that high it's just above six percent but a ban rate is over 25 still guys the reason she's banned so much is not only well she does well but she's still an innately strong Champion but she's so oppressive given the actual matter at the moment in our jungle it has changed for sure but it hasn't changed enough to stop this champion from just being Perma spam gank don't worry about your camps just go and spam gank also because there is lots of catch-up experience in the game for junglers like even if you're level 3 against a level 5 jungler do one camp and it's cycle level six like seriously that's how it works there is so much experience for you to get even if you are behind and you can just like I said you can just Spam gank bot Lane Top Lane if you have like a Renekton air that's why she's bad so much because the play style is so obnoxious and you can see it's clearly successful so if you guys want to play an AP champion at least it's got to be in consideration now moving into the mid lane here we have a champion honestly who's like picked and banned the MSI at the moment this is Ari now for Arya at the moment in the mid lane you are an absolute Beast because the bus not so long ago they made you just obviously a lot better but you're such a great blind pick champion because you don't really have like that many hard counters I'd probably say like Banning Nico is actually an option because Nico at the moment is really strong and does well against Ari especially in the first like five levels so it'd be a little bit maybe like careful of that but yeah generally speaking you can blind pick R and be very happy and look at the pick rate for me and Challenger career 26 and a half percent that's actually crack like I have not seen this unless it's like an ad carry like Jinx or something like 26 and a half percent for a mid laner is unreal the ban rate is at least 14 and this is in over 1200 games still these stats so they have close to a 52 win rate it's pretty naughty also as far as your build goes you can be so versatile you can go ever for us you can even think of going the Andrews anguish if they have a very Tangy team maybe even ludens if you're the sole AP and you can even see here in Challenger and career the highest win rate build is actually going Lucid with everfrost for the utility for the route which pretty much guarantees your charm and then a combo afterwards and then Banshee fell of course you can substitute some of these items for pretty much any other item in the game but yes Ari according to these stats is the ninth best champion in High ELO career now coming in at number eight I don't think anyone can really guess this but if you've been watching MSI this is also a champion who's picked and band like all the time as well this is cassante and this is still on 13.9 by the way guys I'm not talking about 13.8 the MSI patch this is 13.9 and for casante again look at the pick rates for me here in the band rates 22 pick rate a 21.3 ban rate and he's been played in over a thousand matches a 51.6 almost percent win rate it's kind of crazy I would just say if you're going to play this champion in the Top Lane guys please make sure you ban GP the champion completely Cooks you same with Olaf as well Ashley oh Olaf was seeing him picked and banned a lot of MSI as well so do be careful of those champers so casante here is number eight now moving into the jungle this one I think makes a bit more sense maybe or is more understandable for players in lower elos this being kha'zix because of the Buffs in this patch where they gave you extra Q damage this means that when they are isolated that damage is like Amplified by two and a half times as much so for kha'zix when you are queuing someone who is isolated you are going to one shot them like there's no doubt about it the number of carsex players I've seen recently the shepherd is actually really cracked look at the band rate for me 41.6 bro if you're not playing the Cockroach mate right now then you're never gonna play him this is the patch right now to play and I guarantee you as well he's gonna get a Nerf there is no way you can let a champion like this with this however bandwidden pick rate just get away with it and honestly this goes for like all of these Champions guys like unless Ryan above every single other champion in the game to this level they're definitely going to bring down the level these Champs are currently on so if you're a jungler play him if you're not a jungler play them I don't care so kharsix is number seven abusing while you still can and when to number six back into the mid lane here the best damage mid laner in the game is action this Champion guys at the moment looking Challenger in Korea for me the stats a 58.46 win rate that's nutty like this has got to be trolling no it is real this Champion just crushes everything right now Mages there aren't really like many majors who tuck you and in the mid lane because you're going to see them for the most part it's really chill as far as your builds go as well you can also go like free footwork and to raise champions for a bit of sustain you can go PTA into like close range champers to proc this and dominate them your passive is so powerful because of the two hits and then the shield you get as well your heroic swing where you can Gap clothes to those Champions who have used a really important ability or they're just a mobile you can punish them for it but you can start coal and just full greed because there shouldn't be many champions to scare you in the early game so yeah action is here flashing Knight PTA or Fleet doesn't really matter to be honest just make sure you're maxing your queue I think this is definitely the best way to play this Champion for your permit priority right around the map GG well played easy now moving into the top five guys now this first Champion here is a champion who has a change in 13.9 This is Nico with over a 60 win rate in the mid lane in Korean Challenger her ban rate is over 31 as well and I've also heard that Nico is getting buffed as far as the jungle goes if you're playing Lego jungle she's getting buffed in 13.10 but you're actually getting more AP ratio in your ultimate which affects mid lane Nico as well so she will be even stronger now the funny thing here is because they changed your W so you can be a minion or anything on the map people are actually starting W because you go into Lane as a minion and you also get really good priority because of the attack speed this gives you and by doing so you have full pressure in the mid lane just make sure after this yes you are actually putting points in your queue and then your e of course and then Max and your W last but the new W changes have really made Nico a bit of a force in the mid lane and for Top Lane as well you can pick her into Champions like Ken and she does really well into because you just trade old for old and Nico because she has more range and just more like kind of poking potential I guess Kenneth has a bit of a hard time dealing with this but yeah Nico mid lane you can run bone plating you can run a bunch of runes it really just depends on the matchup I guess and as far as your items go going rocket belt again pair this with your pop Blossom it's very scary to play against the damage you deal the Gap closing potential you have it's amazing setup as well for your team I just think she excels at pretty much everything in the game right now so I'd highly recommend guys picking Niko in the mid lane for the next week or so unless they decide to Nerf her in 13-10 now moving down to the bot Lane here guys the first of two support So coming in at number four is a support one let me just put it this way if you want to copy Delight when you play blitzcrank into Mickey X's thresh then yeah I'd recommend watching that game and obviously picking blue track this Champion guys just Cooks so many things on the bot Lane like I can't remember a top Champions video I've done when blitzcrank like wasn't actually in it he's been in like the last 50 I swear this Champion is not and it really goes back towards the end of last season where they buffed his rocket grabs base damage it did get nerfed like in a later patch like from Rank 2 onwards but at level 1 it's still dealing 100 damage and your ultimate as well the base damage got buffed in this too so your actual all-in potential are splits like if you land one Hook is GG Portland of course if you're against something like a Braum Leona tarrick it can be scary Alistair as well right it can be scary because hooking them can actually backfire so be careful about that but yeah look at the band right at least 43 and this is in Korean Challenger where people actually have their monitors turned on and they should be able to anticipate blitzcrank hooks but with hex flash with glacial it's just too much of a threat and it destroys so many champions bowling that's why he's number four with close to a 53 win rate in over 600 games now the top three Champions the only 80 carry guys on this list is a champion who does so well at the moment because of the matter this being Zaya picking Zaya this Champion is still kind of nuts in over a thousand matches in other words over a 21 pick rate over a 55 win rate you have got to be joking me the only Champion you may be struggling against is Israel because this Champion can play a range you can never really hit him with your Q or your e and again he can just Arcane shift pretty much anything you throw at him it's very hard to actually get him in your feathers maybe draven's a little bit scary jinx as well because she can play a range rate but apart from that like there's nothing to be afraid of and because of the matter as well how it's getting more close ranging and stuff Zaya every champion on the Riff so don't just think about like bot Lane and how you carry and support matchups think about the entire summoner's Rift j4 is popular malphite is popular all you have to do is just press your ultimate and you should be chilling desire is number three the only 80 carry on this list so if you're gonna play an 80 carry I think so you have to consider her for sure now moving to the Top Lane guys the second best champion in the game right now is another champion who has picked and banned at MSI and remember Korean Challenger guys or Challenger I guess in most regions is gonna dictate The Meta yeah that's what we see in these pro events because these are the strongest Champions players are playing them at their Peak potential Canon is one of them he is picked and banned all the time first pick him if he's up second pick him if he's not first pick by the enemy team yeah you catch my drift right this Champion is an absolute weapon in the Top Lane because of all the recent Buffs he's got he's been buffed a lot in season 13 and these have pushed him into being really good he is extremely good on the top Lane because you can play a range she can poke the enemy Champions down just be very careful about getting too close to them so if you're against something maybe like a Renekton or an irelia with gap closing do be very careful you probably want to hold on to your e and be careful with using your W to poke them okay because the stun you get from your W by your passive you want to make sure you're using this and then spacing correctly that's really what's going to get you that's really what's going to you but a 10 pick rate 20 ban rate to have over 54 win rate I cannot go through this video without mentioning Canon which is why I'm mentioning him so if you're a top player and your team needs a p or it just looks really good into the enemy team pick Cannon and you cannot go wrong and again guys if you are enjoying this recent content please make sure to leave a like down below hit the Subscribe button so you don't miss any of our future season 13 content and yeah the number one Champion for 13.9 is Recon even though he's been Nerf recently it hasn't stopped this champion and discouraged him from being at the top of the pile over a 32 pick rate that is over 32 that is correct you owe me correctly 1500 matches are 54.4 seven percent win rate guys thank you so much for watching the video I will see you in our next season 13 upload the spinning hey foreign ","1":"patch 13.9 has seen a few new junglers make their way to the top of the meta and how strong is the Nico mini rework shortly after her release we've got all this and much more to break down as we bring you guys a complete look at the solo queue tier list thanks to the help of our Challenger players and analyzing the most recent data but before we get into it be sure to check out skill cap if you want to truly get better at League of Legends we're the only service that offers a money-back guarantee if you don't climb at least five divisions while actively using our service we do this because our service really does work and if it doesn't work for you you shouldn't pay learn more at the end of this video or click the link in the description below so how is the kale mini reward looking so far actually quite good and if you're playing her optimally The champ is back in a great spot one thing we're noticing stat wise with kale is that qmax is performing drastically better than emacs it's about a three percent win rate difference right now with qmax kales winning 52 of the time and emacs winning at 49 there are two variations to the kale builds you can look to run right now the first being the standard nashers into riftmaker and robinons which you could run every every single game and be fine secondly there's the situational Wits End Rush that does extremely well when you're laning into a magic damage top laner lethal Tempo is going to be the best Keystone in most cases with the resolve tree for secondaries if you're thinking of picking kale up in 13.9 she's especially strong for the lower ranks due to her immense scaling power and will be placed in our Top Lane s tier now that Oren is made a charge back into meta and is on the verge of being the most played solo queue top laner who can you play to take advantage of that Fiora is a really good option and performs very well into Oren at least compared to the majority of top laners due to her ability to nullify much of Oren trading power with her W the longer the game goes the more favored it becomes for fewer as well since her true damage and healing potential will Outlast orn in those extended fights Fiora is also a really good answer to other tanks like Scion and kasanti so she's definitely worth having as an option with the way the Top Lane meta is aligned you'll find Fiora as one of the higher rated top laners in 13.9 placed in RS tier for the complete Top Lane tier list we are making a massive Shuffle to the op tier with orange standing alone as the most powerful pick if you guys guys didn't watch our previous tier list and are wondering why Orange has become so much stronger it was due to a huge bug fix he got in 13.8 or an R and E are no longer cleansable which has Amplified his team fight presence even further now this isn't to say the Champs like Pantheon poppy mordekaiser malphite are weak now orange is just on a level above all of them which forces those four Champs down into the S tier still great options but just not as powerful as ore our top three low ELO recommendations for Top Lane include malphite Mundo and nasus Fiora Oren and malphite are a few of the more optimal ban options Nico jungle has been seeing a lot of attention in solo queue and even by many pro players thus far in 13.9 the champion is performing abysmally stat wise but with some optimization we can definitely see that improving over the next few patches Lane ganks with minions are extremely strong and are very difficult for the enemy to play around especially once you get level 6. one reason to why Nico's win rate may be so low is players just messing around with her new passive too much and using it for fun more often than actually using it practically if you want to try out Nico jungle here's what the optimal setup is looking like so far dark Harvest is the best us Keystone Rune along with inspiration for secondaries as for the build rocket belt is the most popular Mythic but night Harvester is actually performing drastically better you can look to try both and see what you prefer but the standard core is either rocket belt or Harvester rush into Shadow flame second and zanya's third we don't think Nico jungle is as bad as her 40 win rate may suggest as many Pros are seeing great success with her so we'll be placing the champ in our jungle B tier for now admittedly our analysts did not see this one coming as the Buffs to amumu have seen the Champion's win rate Spike over five percent that's just absolutely insane and for a change that seemed quite small on paper it's given amumu a drastically stronger Skirmish W damage went up from 12 to 20 at rank 1 and because this is the amount of damage per W tick if a fight lasts for a very long time and you're able to get upwards of 10 ticks off the added damage is incredible master and above amumu is still a pretty average pick but for diamond and Below which is where we focus our tier list placements around amumu is now a top tier jungler for 13.9 moving from a into op the bellevath adjustments dispatch have turned out very positively skewed so so far early clear has become stronger at the expense of a slightly weaker late game and belveth is performing much better in 13.9 as a result it's always more difficult to predict how impactful these damage Buffs to monsters will turn out but they've definitely impacted belvath on a significant level this time around worth noting as well is that velveth is actually performing exceptionally well against kha'zix in 13.9 and with Ka being one of the most played junglers it's helped out belveth a ton on the statistical front we had left belvoth in our jungle s tier for the pre-patch tier list but we'll be giving her the extra push into the op tier for the mid patch update taking a look at the jungle tier list our op tier is comprised of a moomoo belveth Evelyn Jarvan and kha'zix no matter what kind of jungler you like to play there should be one that fits your style in the op tier right now enjoy playing assassin junglers you got Ka and Evelyn who are extremely strong if you guys want to learn more about kha'zix we have a brand new full game commentary on our website showcasing how strong The champ is after the Buffs want more of a tanky Bruiser champ amumu is a no-brainer pickup after his Buffs for a potent skirmishing jungler you've got belveth looking down on everyone else if early ganking is something you like to prioritize look no further than Jarvan especially if you're in low ELO amumu should be added to your champ pool if you want to climb while Vai and Nocturne are also great low ELO options as for the best bands of the patch Evelyn Jarvan and kha'zix are a few of the better options due to their power in the meta and very high play rates if you guys have been following the pro scene as of recent you'd be aware of the rise of Nautilus mid caps pulled it out at MSI and won both games on the pick Abyssal mask was recently buffed a few patches back and it's the item being rushed on Nautilus mid to make him a really great answer to many AP heavy comps for solo queue specifically it's definitely more of a counter pick only kind of champ as it's quite good into melees but struggles heavily into range going off some statistics in 13.9 not is seeing good results into cat Fizz and akali but is losing heavily to aurelian Soul Ari and vegar in the correct spots the champion is definitely a solid pick but due to his struggles in many ranged matchups we will be placing not in our mid lane b-tier there really weren't any meta breaking changes to mid lane this patch so let's take a look at the tier list Nico has landed about out where we expected for mid lane being a solid eight-tier pickup it's always hard to gauge the true power of a rework Champion right after their release due to many new players skewing data but Nico is definitely a powerful pick in the right hand most notable shift this patch was Fizz going from s into op which was a change we made in the pre-patch tier list Lich Bane Buffs have been really nice for Fizz and he's currently the best solo queue assassin at the moment one other mid who has seen a nice spike in power this patch is Talia nice quality of life buff to her ultimate that has seen her add a little over one percent to her overall win rate s tier is where you'll find Talia on the mid lane tier list optimal low ELO mid lane champs for the patch include malzahar aurelian soul and Annie highest on the ban list for mid lane are Rez and Fizz a new trend we have seen emerging over the past few patches is Carl being picked way more often as a starting item on adc's afelios is 180c many players have been running the item on in recent patches but it's now spilled over to many more adcs as well we're seeing it much more commonly on adc's who are more reliant on item spikes and come online super hard in the mid to late game Zary and Jinx are 280 species that Pros are really liking call on right now for that reason it's not something you're going to want to take on more aggressive early game adcs like Draven Tristana or Samira though if you're playing a strong scaling ADC and especially in a lane where you don't think there is going to be any kill threat look to start call and accelerate into your mid game Spike faster for the ADC tier list it's looking very similar to how we had it for pre-patch with Jinx karthus and kog'maw locking down op tier spots Nerf to jinx landed exactly as we expected not enough to push her out of meta as she continues to hold on to her op tier position by a threat 13.10 is going to be the massive shake-up patch for ADC with all the item changes so definitely be on the lookout for content in the next few weeks where we break down all the best new builds for ABC's top three low ELO adcs of the patch are Tristana Miss Fortune and vegar a few of the most banworthy adcs include Jinx ziya and Draven it was a rather uneventful patch for the support role with Swain being the only Champion changed and not seeing any significant rise in power as a result the tier list is looking exactly the same to where we had it in pre-patch with Jonah Recon Cena blitzcrank Emilio being the most OP carries just like ADC support has a ton of item changes planned for 13.10 so that is the patch we should see a really nice shift in The Meta top three low ELO support recommendations are Heimerdinger Emilio and Zyra best bands of the patch include Recon thresh and milio all right guys before we wrap this out let's tell you a little more about skill cap so we offer a five division rank up guarantee and think that's a pretty crazy thing to offer it's like a gym membership guaranteeing you'll get ripped your local gym would go bust if they offered that right not us we've offered this for years because our service really does work it works so well in fact that we are able to produce by far the largest catalog of Premium League guides on the internet we add over 20 videos a week with over 1600 guides curated into over 100 courses no one can compare we've also sent Challenger players into ELO hell's 714 times and Counting where they commentate how to carry live they also respond to all questions asked sign up today for as little as 6.99 a month if you are serious about improving so that's gonna wrap everything up for the 13.9 mid patch tier list update thank you all so much for watching good luck in solo queue and we'll see next one ","2":"yo yo yo what's going on game leapers oh my goodness this could be the most Red Hood video of all time mate patch 13.10 this is pretty much gonna be a new season for League of Legends when this hits the rift guys this patch has so many changes and there are so many item changes like I don't even know what they had the pre-season for like this should have been the preseason This is Gonna Change how the rift is played it's going to change the Champions who are op there are so many item changes here that we're about to get into did I mention those item changes and yes before we get into the video guys just make sure if you actually want to improve of the game for sure like if you're playing someone like Varys or cold war in 13.10 you're gonna win more games I think if these changes go through but you're still gonna be the same player right like you have to understand that what remains constant in the game is wave management is back timing discounting cooldowns and all this stuff right being able to see us your general mechanics and micro we can teach you how to improve everything so it doesn't even matter like what happens in terms of the matter you'll be Challenger forever check out the website links Down Below in the description or comment section and yeah let's get into all of these changes so we're going to start with just the champion bus now lots of Champions here action callista Kindred and vayne pretty much think of these guys as having more AP in their kit and AP scaling because and you'll know why in the future there are going to be some item changes that are giving more AP and because they will be items for those ranged Champions that's why Ryder doing this but anyway item changes now first of all let's start in the bot Lane and talk about Chalice of blessing this support item component builds into Redemption McHale's and Echoes of Helia so it's giving you 200 hp 75 base Mana region and the passive called Harmony you're gaining 25 base Health regeneration for every additional 25 base Mana regeneration now we also have life well pendant here so this pulls into Zeke's Knightsville locket and Evan shroud this is giving you 150 HP 20 armor and 100 base Health Region those tankier supports then we have Echoes of Helia a new support item 30 ability power 200 hp 15 abilities and 125 base Mana regen your soul siphon passive means that when you damage your Champion you get a soul shot and up to a maximum of two of these and were you heal a shield so we're talking about these enchantresses an ally this consumes all of those Soul shards and restores the Allies HP and Deals magic damage per Shard to the nearest enemy Champion now this seems a little bit toxic like a Janet just eating her ID carry but yeah anyway the other passive here is called dissonance you're gaining three ability power her 25 base Mana regeneration and the Mythic passive is your getting ability host now moving on to yomu's ghost weight and this is where it really gets Saucy so yomu's 60 attack damage 18 lethality 20 ability host but it's now going to be a Mythic item and the actual active is giving you 25 movement speeding ghosting for six seconds and during this time you generate Stacks two times faster now speaking of these Stacks haunt the actual passive here you gain up to 100 spectral shards while moving you gain up to 50 movement speed at a champion combat based on the number of spectral shots now when you're at Max shards you gain lethality based on level so you can actually have at least 30 lethality when you buy this item and you will be one shotting pretty much everyone now shards will reset 4 seconds after daily damage to an enemy champion and the actual Mythic passive here for ghostbed is giving attack damage now dustblade is going to remain as a lethality Mythic here so exactly the same stats as ghostblade but the nice stalker passive is now changing so your abilities deal up to an additional 15 damage based on the target's missing health and when a champion that you have damage within the last three seconds dies so this is still the same but what's different here is that you become untargetable no longer invisible from non-structures for one and a half seconds and it's going to ground ability has some movement speed by the Mythic passive now parallel score guys is no longer going to be a Mythic item this is going to be a legendary item and it's giving 55 A.D 15 lethality and 15 ability haste and the sand strike active is now turning into a passive so after dashing blinking or exiting stealth your next attack on a champion deals an additional bit of physical damage and if this is dealt by a melee champion this attack also slows the Target by 99 so it's pretty much got the old dust blade passive onto it now moving down to the bot Lane here and this is where the video gets red hot ginsu's rage blade this item is back guys with a Vengeance the this item is giving you 30 attack damage and 30 ability power as well as 25 attack speed now the pass is here wrath attacks apply 30 magic damage on here now your Critical Strike chance is converted into up to 200 more magic damage on hit so that's changing how Ginsu is going to work and also the saving strike passive basic attacks Grant eight percent attack speed stacking up to four times for a Max of 32 percent now when you're at 32 percent fully stacked every third attack after this applies your on hit effects twice now the Mythic passive against us is giving armor penetration and Magic penetration that's why they've given some 80 carries AP scaling or just AP in their kids because maybe you want to run it down and just try it out now Infinity Edge guys is turning into the Mythic stat stick so it's giving you attack damage crit strike chance and also Critical Strike damage and the passive is just giving you attack damage so if you want straight up damage build this item and what's interesting here is the infinity edge and novori we're about to get into which is also a Mythic they're not procking so the actual passives they're not procking I mean Infinity Edge doesn't even have a passive but yeah novori is not procking off a certain amount of crit now so you can just build these whenever you want to and speaking often before it 60 A.D 20 crit 20 abilities transcenders you're still keeping this you're a tax reduce your non-ultimate ability cooldowns by 12 but you're getting in permanence now a new passive your abilities deal up to 20 increase damage based on crit chance now the passive here you're getting ability has now music to the ears here guys because static shiv is coming back 3 000 gold you're getting 45 attack damage 25 attack speed and 20 Critical Strike chance and the passives are as follows energized moving and attacking will generate an energized attack this energized attack is called electroshock and this fires chain lightning that applies damage Bonus Match damage and this increases against minions oh my goodness split pushing is back and I cannot wait to see this back on the Riff please let me know guys in the comment section how hyped you are it's gonna be so now mortal shilpo is no longer gonna be a Mythic item this is just gonna be a legendary item and you're getting 50 attack damage 20 crit and seven percent live still now you you're still getting the lifeline passive so when taking damage that will reduce you to below 30 HP you're getting a shield for three seconds and you also get attack speed or 8 seconds here now go Force remaining as a Mythic item so you're getting 55 attack damage 15 attack speed 20 crit seven percent movement speed and the cloud burst active you dash in Target Direction firing three missiles at the lowest Health enemy near your destination obviously prioritizing championship and this deals physical damage and this increases if the enemy Champion is lower this is also granting you attack damage via the Mythic passive Now kraken Slayer guys interestingly enough is not going to be a Mythic as well so Shield bone Kraken no longer mythics legendary items so for crack and Slayer you're getting 40 attack damage and 30 attack speed and 20 crit and the bring it down passive every third attack applies 20 bonus magic damage which scale off your A.D and also magic damage and additional Triggers on the same Target within 6 seconds increases its damage by 50 so if you're playing Varys kogmore Kaiser Missouri watch out for these in 13.10 rapifier can guys is also getting changed so 30 attack damage 15 attack speed 20 crit seven percent movement speed and you're getting the energized attack again just like shiv but this time it's a sharp shooter energize attack which applies bonus magic damage in addition that Energizer attack is gaining up to 35 bonus attack range now storm razor guys is getting changed as well so it's getting 55 attack damage 15 attack speed 20 crit and you're also getting an energized attack from this from moving and attacking but this time it's a bolt and this bolt is going to apply bonus magic damage which scales off attack damage and also ability power and grants 45 movement speed for one second now we also have Lord Dominus regards getting changed and this is also really interesting so you're still keeping 35 attack damage 20 crit 30 armor penetration and the giant side passive deal up to 25 bonus physical and Magic damage against Champions with greater Max HP than you again cold more is just gonna absolutely profit this now finally here guys Imperial mandate is going to be a legendary item so it's giving you 55 ability power 20 ability has 100 hundred percent base Mana region and the coordinated fire Pacific abilities look slow or immobilizer Champion while they deal bonus magic damage and they mark their Champion still and yes your ally Champion can detonate that Mark and that will deal an additional bit of magic damage and Grant you both movement speed for a couple of seconds here these are absolutely massive changes to the items in the game at the moment and we will do a future video guys and all the other item changes very soon indeed so if you have any thoughts any comments any questions of course about these changes please leave them in the comment section and make sure you hit that subscribe button for our future video on the rest of the changes there's so so many of course leave a like down below as well if you did enjoy the video and I'll see you in that next video there's been ex peace [Music] ","3":"the Nico and kale mini reworks headline patch 13.9 along with some Buffs to weaker foes like volley bear and trundle while Jinx is finally receiving a NERF with the help of our Challenger players and analyzing the most recent data we are set to bring you guys a complete update on the solo Q tier list but before we get into it be sure to check out skill cap if you want to truly get better at League of Legends we're the only service that offers a money-back guarantee if you don't climb at least five divisions while actively using our service we do this because our service really does work and if it doesn't work for you you shouldn't pay learn more at the end of this video or click the link in the description below the only item a rune change being pushed alive for 13.9 is a buff to lichbane AP on the item is going up from 75 to 85. Twisted Fate Fizz and Echo are the three Champions who will benefit most from these Buffs as they build the item as a core pickup in most games some Evelyn nidalee and Victor players like building the item as well so they'll see an indirect boost too Fizz is definitely a mid laner to watch this patch as he was just directly buffed a few patches back and has been in a great spot so this Lich Main enough may be enough to push him over the edge moving on to the Top Lane changes Riot will be partially reverting the Nerfs they gave to aatrox way back in 13.1 passive damage health ratio is going back up from four scaling to 10 to 4 scaling to 12 our bonus movement speed is being increased as well from 50 scaling to 80 to 60 scale into 100. overall pretty insignificant Buffs that we don't see moving the needle enough to push aatrox back into the Top Lane meta as a result aatrox will remain in our Top Lane a tier for 13.9 the only top laner Nerf for 13.9 is going to be psya passive Health losses going from two scaling to 19 plus one per level to 2.3 scaling to 24.4 plus 1.3 per level Riot has stated this will shorten the duration of Scion Passive by about 1 to 1.5 seconds total over the course of thousands of games you're definitely going to lose out on a kill here or there but in the grand scheme of things this Nerf should not impact Scion all that much after all if you're winning Lane and not dying all the time this change literally doesn't matter it's more of a Nerf to The lethality Scion ending strategy where getting kills with his passive is actually quite important for Scion's tearless placement in 13.9 he will find a spot in our Top Lane a tier these kale Buffs are looking absolutely incredible let's jump right into the r changes as these are the big ones cast time on R is being reduced from 1.5 down to 0.5 seconds the DPS increase from this change alone is going to drastically improve Kale's dueling power the AOE damage delay is being increased from 1.5 to 2.5 seconds invulnerability duration is going from two scaling to 3 seconds to 2.5 seconds at all ranks although weaker late game the added invulnerability time for the early stages of the game is well worth the trade-off as we see this being a net buff the AOE radius on Ultimate is being increased from 525 flat to 675 scaling to 775. damage on R is being lowered from 200 scaling to 500 to 200 scaling to 400. keep in mind now that your R cast time is one second less with a bunch of items the added Auto attacks you'll be able to get in will more than make up for this lost R damage the other change is being issued are centered around kl's e on hit AP ratio is going from 25 to 20 percent passive wave damage is being increased from 15 scaling to 35 to 20 scaling to 41. from a quality of life perspective these changes are amazing for kale and will be great for the long-term health of the champion where she lands power wise is difficult to predict due to the unique nature of the changes so we'll be leaving kale in the a tier for now and we'll have a more accurate update for you guys in our mid-patch tier list moving on to the Top Lane tier list we have orange poppy mordekaiser malphite and Pantheon as the highest priority carries now you might be wondering well why is orange suddenly in the op tier he never got any changes recently right wrong orange e and r are no longer cleansable which is a huge buff to the champ but Riot through the changes into the bug fix section of the 13.8 patch to where very few people would notice this bug fix alone has provided Oren with a huge boost to his team fight power especially with cleanse being such a consistent Summoner spell on many adcs as a result Oren is joining the Top Lane op tier for 13.9 our top three low ELO picks for Top Lane include Yorick Mundo and nasus best value bands of the patch are Fiora Darius and malphite so a much needed volley bear Buffs are finally on the way but they're a bit underwhelming unfortunately W damage health ratio is going from five to six percent W heel health ratio is also up from Seven scaling to 13 to 8 scaling to 16 not completely worthless Buffs but nothing that will drastically increase the power level of volley bear for solo queue if you guys are considering playing some volley bear this patch and want to learn more about him our Challenger jungler skill shot is an avid volley bear player and he's got a bunch of full game commentaries for the champ on our website we'll be giving the bear the bump from B into a tier for 13.9 but there's still many better options to choose from above him a pretty nice amumu buff is being issued with his W base damage going from 12 scaling to 28 to 20 at all ranks W percent Health damage is going from one Skilling to 1.6 percent to one scaling to two percent early game especially this is a really nice buff to amumu as we can see in the background gameplay five ticks of w damage with the Buffs is equal to 20 added damage overall sometimes you'll even be able to get more than five ticks of w off so the extended Skirmish power of amumu will become a bit stronger early on amumu will see the same positional change on the tier list as volley bear going from B into a a few bass stat Buffs are penciled in for trundle this patch with his base Mana going from 281 to 340 and base attack speed up from 0.6 to 0.67 a buff that likely brings trundle back into a viable state for solo queue but nothing that pushes him to the top of the Jungle tier list for now we'll be leaving the troll King in the jungle beat here velveth will see a bit of a power shift for 13.9 with her early game becoming stronger and the late game taking a hit Q monster damage is going from 120 to 140 percent to enhance early clear speed to compensate velvet's attack damage growth is going from 1.7 to 1.5 as you can see from the background gameplay this equates to three less A.D at level 18. early on these changes are definitely a net win for Belvedere and for a High ELO especially we see them more positively skewed for low ELO however where games tend to drag out much longer and the early game is not as important we wouldn't be surprised if valve's win rate saw a small drop overall we won't be making any adjustments to belvettes tier list displacement as she will remain a strong s tier pick in 13.9 there are a bunch of great junglers to choose from right now with kha'zix Fiddlesticks Evelyn and Jarvan being the most optimal carries great mix of everything right now as Jarvan is the best ganking jungler Evelyn and Fiddle are Great Farm for six Champs and kha'zix is the most lethal skirmisher out of the four one other minor adjustment we'll be making is moving Lilia into the S tier Buff's last patch combined with the cosmic Drive changes have been a little more impactful than originally anticipated and Lilia is performing very well in solo queue once again our top three low ELO recommendations for Jungle include Fiddlesticks mordekaiser and Nocturne Evelyn Jarvan and kha'zix are the highest priority jungle bands Nico mini rework is hitting the rift in 13.9 so let's get you up to speed with how things will be shaping out Nico will have a brand new passive to where she can turn into any non-effic monster minion trap Ward or plant all she has to do is stand beside them for two seconds and will then be able to click on her bar to become that unit this will definitely give Nico passive way more power especially for those arum fights where you can disguise yourself as a minion this change is one we see impacting Nico way more for the lower ranks but it's overall a buff for sure next up Q damage is going to be nerfed with it losing 5 damage at all ranks AP ratio is up however so it's an early game Nerf and a late game buff looks like Riot wants Nico to be viable in the jungle as they're giving her q30 scaling to 70 bonus damage to monsters W change is looking super awesome as you'll now be able to reactivate Nico clone and send the Clone to a new location the skill expression of Nico has just gone up a ton due to this change which is great to see WM powered attacks will also be dealing 50 bonus damage to monsters e will receive the same kind of treatment we saw with Nico's Q with its base damage going down by 10 at all ranks but the AP ratio increased from 60 to 65 percent finally we have the r changes and the big one is that when Nico jumps up into the air she will suspend all nearby enemies before it was only when you're crashing back to the ground when you would get the CC effect but now it will start a bit sooner so that's definitely a buff but from then on out it's all nurse sunico r spell will no longer provide a shield damage from ours going down from 200 scaling to 650 to 150 scaling to 550 AP ratio is also down from 130 to 100 cooldown is drastically increased as well from 90 flat to 120 scaling to 90 seconds so all in all Nico's kit has definitely become stronger but with so many of the numbers chopped in her spells it's difficult to say if she'll actually land as a more powerful pick right away burst damage is down but will the new sneaky element of her passive be enough to make up for that for now we'll be leaving Nico in the mid lane a tier and have a more accurate rating for you guys during our mid-patch tier list lots of quality Life Changes being handed out in 13.9 and next in line is Talia our cooldown will no longer be locked out when you're dealing damage only if you're taking damage this will give Talia some nice added catch power to where she can one shot a target from brush and then user R immediately after the setup of play or chase down enemies Talia is one of the more underrated mids for solo queue and with this change we see her slotting in as a great s-tier pick for the mid lane tier list there are plethor era of powerful Champions to choose from with fizz Pantheon Annie Cassiopeia and Ari making up the op tier Fizz moving into op is the only significant change we're making to the mid lane tier list this patch as the Lich Bane Buffs are going to give him that extra bit of pop for Mid game fights to climb low ELO the fastest from mid lane you should consider adding vegar aurelian Soul or anti-tier champion pool Ari Zed and Fizz are three of the most bandworthy mids for 13.9 the only ADC being changed for 13.9 is the only one who's really in need of a Nerf being Jinx A.D growth is going from 3.4 to 3.15 this is another one of those changes that negatively impacts Jinx a lot more for low ELO than it does for a High ELO kalista saw a similar change a few patches back but instead of seeing her ad growth lowered it was increased this led to about a 0.5 percent increase in callista's solo queue win rate so pretty insignificant we should expect something similar but in the opposite direction for Jinx with her likely losing up to a Max of one percent from her win rate whether or not jinx remains in the op tier is a tough call because we expect her to be right on the line between snop so we'll be leaving her in op for now and if the Nerfs are a bit more harsh than expected she'll be adjusted into s for the bot Lane tier list we've made a few adjustments for this patch moving karthus and kog'maw into the optier alongside Jinx we've been keeping a close eye on karthus in recent patches and for about four patches in a row now his playwright has increased every patch with his win rate remaining extremely high tyler1 has been spamming kartha's bot in his Challenger climb in EU with the pick being by far His Highest win rate champion and this is likely why it's starting to be picked a lot more play rate of karthus has doubled since 13.4 but his win rate has not seen a drop-off which indicates it's not just one tricks or tyler1 that are inflating the win rate if you're looking to add an AP carry to your champion pool right now karthus is definitely the top pick with seraphine and vegar being not too far behind the optimal low ELO bot Lane carries the patch include Tristana Miss Fortune and vegar Jinx ziya and Draven are the highest value ADC bands for 13.9 just like ADC a very light patch for support as well with Swain being the only Champion adjusted Buffs to swing Q are on the way with its base damage increased by five at all ranks and the AP ratio up from 38 to 40 percent bonus damage per bolt is up as well from 12 scaling to 52 to 15 scaling to 55. AP ratio per bolt is up from eight to ten percent nothing massive here that is going to propel Swain back into the support meta so we will be leaving him in the B tier for the time being for the support tier list Jonah Recon sent a blitzcrank Emilio are on a level above everyone else you could easily construct a really nice champion pool just out of the op tier supports right now with milio and Janna being great enchanter picks Blitz and Recon being your more aggro engage Champs and Cena being that pure carry the most effective support Champions to climb low ELO the fastest are Emilio Annie and Zyra Recon thresh Emilio are who you should consider Banning the most alright guys before we wrap this up let's tell you a little more about skill cap so we offer a five division rank up guarantee and think that's a pretty crazy thing to offer it's like a gym membership guaranteeing you'll get ripped your local gym would go bust if they offered that right not us we've offered this for years because our service really does work it works so well in fact that we are able to produce by far the largest catalog of Premium League guides on the internet we add over 20 videos a week with over 1600 guides curated into over 100 courses no one can compare we've also sent Challenger players into elohel's 714 times and Counting where they commentate how to carry live they also respond to all questions asked sign up today for as little as 6.99 a month if you are serious about improving so that's going to wrap up everything for this latest update on the solo queue tier list thank you all so much for watching good luck on the rift and we'll catch you back soon ","4":"hey Summoners what's up and welcome back my name is Kirks and today we're going to take a look at the new high yellow tier list for this one we've assembled the most insightful people on the platform to deliver you the best list you can possibly find similar to Lilo ELO TLS we've improved the readability and visibility while streamlining the numbers of ranks tier lists are supposed to be easy and accessible and not just extras but if you're into anything extra you're more than welcome to look at our service over at proguids.com give it a look in the description below and join as a free member or Go premium for the 799 build monthly another thing you can get for absolute free is it going to our Top Lane tier list for this patch take a good look around before we ride into our first pick of the patch before we do that though it's time to briefly talk about the Niko midscope update given ride's approach to balancing on new Champions we can expect a lot of changes in the upcoming weeks therefore we want to give Niko a tentative placement and be very conservative with it now we go back to our first pick gragas is truly the life of the party as he is versatile in both his role and play style whether you want to thank support or Carry gragas has got you covered his flexibility extends those choices of lanes too giving you plenty of options to shake things up for this piece however we are giving him the spotlight for the Top Lane one of his most popular build pops includes the rod of Aegis the sustain provided by Catalyst of the Ians combined with gragas path of happy hour means that he can proactively drink his way through any type of laning matchup without breaking a sweat but graga's true strength lies in his ability to make a big impact regardless of the situation when behind he can still contribute to his team and win ahead he can be a true nightmare for the enemy with his unique combination of utility and draw power gragas is always a valuable pick and is honestly astonishing how Riot games has not touched this Champion so far another champion that has been an agonizing pain for top laners is our next pick with Olaf you have exactly what you need when it comes to aggressive laning something we've been trying to implement more often as of recently is telling you to sacrifice early gold for experience points in the Top Lane XP appearance is far more valuable especially if you're talking about early levels coincidentally you'll also see a lot of Champions pretty high up the list that are capable of being a bully level 1. for example Olaf can face check bushes in lane and assume a very aggressive position briefly after he can wait until the enemy is close enough to be run down keep on throwing your ax and don't let them get anything for free if you're able to get this done properly without ruining your wave in the process you can ideally Force an early dive with your jungler and I know I'm asking for quite much here at least follow junglers to not play on locked cam only and honestly the only part of advice that really helps against this is to utilize pings and pray that your jungler isn't playing on full mood because then you can use those plays to accelerate your and your jungle's lead at the same time and basically win games for free big players also come for the next part of this video but before that let's take a brief look at our full jungle tier list to get this one done we talk to countless Specialists to make sure that those OP picks are absolute fire first we have a nidalee and before you get flustered we need to get one thing straight nidalee is a champion that will require a lot of practice mechanical prowess and a clean decision making to turn her into a true Menace one of the most important things for nidalee is Temple and invading learning about the enemy's most typical jungle path and finding ways to kill them is your go-to move furthermore there's something that people continuously do wrong and it's all about patience and foresight don't just throw your spear for fun especially if you still have red buff you are an assassin type jungler and your Spears hitbox is rather small thrown from other Vision or use the following trick this trick is as simple as it is powerful with red buff and the fact that you're a range Champion with a gap closer you could use your alt attacks to apply pressure don't forget that the enemy Champion has to mentally deal with the USPS cooldown and if they get attacked even flash won't help them as a consequence you want to put them in a spot in which they have to blow their salmon as well before you use your vital cooldown other than that do yourself a favor invest into a rocket belt and the Magi stocks now that we have given you a high skill ceiling AP carry for the jungle we move over to an 80 type of carry belveph recently received a change to accuse monster modifier given that this is the ability belvath is spamming during a jungle clear as well as the one she's maxing out first is kind of a big deal for her as a champion you're able to gank early on but your biggest and earliest power Spike comes at level 6. once you are able to pick up those void corals you are truly Unleashed when it comes to carrying potential so no worries if you don't get off any place before level 6 if anything you can be really happy with that outcome as your hyper scaling Champion scaling also comes in the hard form for mid lane TLS tests a lot of Ages still hasn't been touched properly first however let's take a look at our current standings funnily enough both of the champions We featured in the low ELO tier list are also absolutely broken for higher elos anivia and Cassiopeia Still Rock with the rod of Aegis and gragas also has a major place in the mid lane surely speaking about this over and over again will get boring so we prepare two other picks for you Victor is a decently strong Elena with a brutal scaling into the later stages of the game be it as an abusive First Strike money printer against melee Champions or brutal Lane Dominion with Airy whatever you want Victor's got it contrary to a lot of other Mages movement is much more important for Victor as every cooldown of his is absolutely vital starting with a typical trading pattern of resetting your auto attack with your q and making sure that you're not grieving yourself with typical AutoCast on UE will be the foundation of your gameplay in addition to that you also very CS hungry as you're not one of those I run around the map type of Champions that bank on the Enemy being absolutely blind your greatest asset however is your ultimate during objective fights and are asked you to view it from a different perspective after this your ultimate isn't only a tool to cancel channels or to deal damage it's also to control space the enemy backline might get cut off from their front line if you place it strategically with progress in game time this becomes even more important since not everyone is able to chill your chaos storm without just dying since we have briefly talked about the runner on the map Champions I think it's mandatory to give action some spotlight light this Champion is the embodiment of going rogue and strikes fear into most enemies for an assassin like 80 carry one might think that is wave clear is lacking but that's not really the case with the qmax you can soak wave super fast and start unleashing your Terror on the rift and for mid lane there's an absolutely broken trick that most people don't use or even pay attention to usually you'd avoid a vault where the enemy places it but what about using it to your advantage leaving towards a certain lane and then turning around in stealth can catch people off guard a lot of times not only that you're basically applying pressure to a lane you're not even going to not to mention that if your enemy Lane is a little bit drowsy he might forget about your existence too and we all know what happens if you encounter an action in the river for our next list we are going to dive into the 80 carry roll so feel free to observe the list as we reach the higher elos we cannot finally abuse the laning power of karthus to its fullest Enrique Havoc to this day people still believe kafis is a weak laner or jungler which doesn't make any sense if anything he's just not that popular just listen to the following and take take it with a grain of salt imagine you could play the 80k roll and die very often and yet impact the game positively thanks to your Champion's kit sounds convincing then why aren't you playing card first you can have both Lane dominance with the proper support or chill relax weak side gaming clearing waves and scaling to Infinity if playing AP Champion isn't your type of thing then you can still pick up zayo this Champion went missing on our last tier list due to a little accident but she's back in full force fundamentally speaking Zaya is a great Champion when it comes to playing front to back if the entire enemy team wants to dive into your team your Champion will become substantially stronger they have to constantly deal with the potential fear of your feathers being pulled back and getting nuked in the process this also leads them to move in certain directions to avoid that from happening with novoria being an insane second item on her this will further Empower her kid and make it even more difficult for the enemy to find openings against her adding to all those tools she also has another tool for self-pure and bloodthirst as a third item Choice makes it even more difficult to kill her before we check out the crank let's take a look at our full support t-list another champion that's also quite difficult to face is blitzcrank this Champion's creativity and impact is further Amplified by one simple minor Rune and that's hacks flash with hacks flash you can basically trade your flash almost instantly phone enemies once that happens it's time for you to use bushes and apply constant pressure you not being seen is often a bigger threat than when you are visible on your screens to make full use of your Hack Slash Rune though you gotta make sure to look for proactive players around the map flashing into mid lane from the Raptor pit or avoiding certain warts with the power of hacks flash when it comes to that it's all up to your skill but requires barely any skill however is a glacial augment if you get into the enemy's melee range without blowing your hook and get off an e then all counter play is gone and they'll be slowed for ages and they will not get out of your grasp anymore our next Champion offers a similar Embrace to you and it's the last Embrace from Senna this lovely lady is an absolute demon when it comes to bullying people out of Lane scaling and taking over games in this case I'm not talking about the hot steel tank belt but the eclipse carry build this will allow you to demolish people with straw traits and all ends if constantly bullying your opponent with auto attacks is your thing then Cena will be the love of your life as she's the queen of doing so just don't commit one certain error don't pick into the following Champion historically speaking our next pick has been pretty decent into Santa with seraphine you have a combination of an enchanter that can counter-engage engage and sustain not only that this Champion also offers you the benefits of being able to single-handedly carry or assume a supportive position with a minimal to no effort just make sure that you put three points into your queue and then max out your W as fast as possible this will be your most vital spell for team fight next to your ultimate and your roots utility honestly if you want to climb play their Champion but if you want some more detailed advice you should most certainly take a look at one of our master classes or Services an advanced class with sneaky in the bot lane or general sniper telling you how to carry your Heavyweight World Championship winner teammate we got it all just check it out in the description below with that we conclude today's video thank you all for watching and don't forget to leave a like and sub to the channel if you want to stay updated on everything League ","5":"welcome back everyone to a brand new update on the best solo carries this time for patch 13.9 as always we'll be covering three champions for every single role that holds some of the most consistent carry power for the current meta but before we get into it be sure to check out skill capped if you want to truly get better at League of Legends we're the only service that offers a money back guarantee if you don't climb at least five divisions while actively using our service we do this because our service really does work and if it doesn't work for you you shouldn't pay learn more at the end of this video or click the link in the description below One champion who has shot up in power over the past patch due to a bug fix that a lot of people may have missed is orn Riot fixed a bug to wear orange e and r knock-ups were previously cleansable with cleanse being such a consistent Summoner spell taken on adc's these days being able to use it against Oren R and E were great for adcs now that they can't do this it provides Oren with a much stronger team fight and reliable way to isolate the enemy carry this bug fix alone has led to around a two percent Spike to Orange overall win rate not only this but Oren actually has really solid matchup ups for the Top Lane meta Oren plays great in a malphite Darius and Scion who are three of the highly contested top laners Fiora is one matchup you may want to consider Banning as her W makes it so that Oren is more limited as to how he can play traits it's all about finding those catch plays when you have the numbers Advantage with Oren his long range engage from R makes him one of the best top laners at punishing positional errors so keeping track of where the enemy team is on the map is key standard build for Oren is Sunfire rush into jock show second and thornmail third run grasp for the Keystone with demolished second wind and overgrowth optimal secondaries are magical Footwear and biscuits another top laner who has seen a big spike in strength over the past patch and our second Solo Carry selection is Poppy players always seem to underestimate the laning power of Poppy and her ability to dismantle many of the meta Top Lane picks with Poppy's passive you have such a consistent harass tool and the best part about it is that you can proc grasp on use this allows you to whittle down melee Champs super easy in Lane once you have the enemy chunked out poppy e and w provide her great Mobility to punish the enemy if they disrespect you're all in power our Challenger top laner's trumpist highlights this extremely well in his brand new full game commentary for poppy that can be found on our website the only matchups that may give you some issues are Darius and Gangplank as your W is not as effective due to them lacking a gap closer so either champ is a good ban option build for poppy is a Divine sunderer rush into Sunfire ages second and force of nature or thornmail third Rune page consists of grasp with Shield bash second wind and Revitalize followed by biscuits and Time Warp tonic for secondaries one Top Lane shampoo has stood the test of time and continues to be a consistently strong solo Q carry is malphite you really can never go wrong with malphite because no matter your matchup or how the game is playing out you can always make an impact due to his strong team fight presence who cares if the enemy team has a Fed ADC malphite can easily isolate them due to his long range from R and once he's on top of them his attack speed slow from E and pure tankiness hard counters their ability to do anything in fights a 50 attack speed slow at Max rank is just unplayable for Champions that need to Auto attack to deal their damage malphite has his share of weaker matchups right now with more Zion and Silas being the three you want to avoid Silas would be the one who we'd recommend Banning the most out of those three as we mentioned earlier though how the lane phase plays out is not as important for a champ like malphite due to his reliable team fight power core build for malphite is an iceborn Gauntlet rush into Sunfire Aegis second and thornmail third grasp is the best Keystone Rune when you are in melee matchups and are planning to Max W out first comet is the most optimal in range matchups where you are not able to trade Auto attacks consistently therefore seeing less value out of grasp and going for a q Max one jungler making a serious push back into meta over the past patch has been kha'zix and he kicks off our jungle top three kha'zix is the definition of a Solo Carry jungler as his ability to completely take over games due to his consistent burst power is massive he was on such a short cooldown and a point-and-click ability so when you gain an early lead with Ka there is very little the enemy can do to counter you other than avoiding interaction at all costs oftentimes with these assassin junglers what holds players back from succeeding is their over aggression with a lead when you get ahead on keep it simple play around objective timers set up in fog of war and make the enemy team face check into you if you're just diving into fights in the middle of Lane you're really playing with fire as Ka is a champ who wants to be isolating carries when they are split from their Team Matchup wise for Kyle Rengar is really the only jungler giving most Cloud players issues right now so he's a good band to consider all three lethality Mythic items are viable for kha'zix depending on preference second item ghost blade works very well and Edge of night is a great third pickup Rune page revolves around first strike with free boots Futures market and Cosmic Insight Sudden Impact and treasure hunter are for secondaries with Lich Bane seeing Buffs for patch 13.9 the jungler who will be loving the changes and an exceptionally strong Solo Carry is Echo nashers had taken over in previous patches but now with these Lich Bane Buffs both items will be really good pickups depending on the situation if you're playing into a full squishy enemy comp that you can easily one shot then go with lichbane nazers is going to work better when you are into more Bruiser or tank Champs where you will have to be throwing in more Auto attacks to win fights two item spike is key for Echo and a really good win condition you should be looking to play towards without question the best ban for Echo right now is kha'zix as he's highly played in meta and his stealth can be very annoying for Echo to play around Rune page for Echo is First Strike with free boots Futures market and Cosmic Insight followed by eyeball collection and Treasure Hunter for secondaries the longest standing jungler in the top three and possibly even for all roles is Jarvan if you are looking for a strong early ganking jungler then Jarvan is definitely who you should side with instead of echo or kha'zix say for example your last pick and notice your Bot Lane has locked Tristana Nautilus picking Jarvan and playing around bot Lane would be super free with that bot Lane combo vice versa if your last pick and your team is playing Champs with weaker gank setup like in Ezreal Jonah Lane going kha'zix or Echo would be better in those spots where early ganks aren't as reliable to win with Jarvan you definitely have to be proactive throughout the early game ideally pathing to whichever Lane provides you the best gank setup fan wise for Jarvan you really can't go wrong with kha'zix right now as for the build it's a Gore Drinker or Eclipse rush into Black Cleaver second and death's dance Third Run conqueror for the Keystone with Triumph alacrity and coup de gras magical Footwear and Cosmic Insight are the best secondaries a champion making his way back into meta in a big way for patch 13.9 is going to be Fizz Not only was Fizz just buffed a few patches back but in 13.9 Lich Bane is seeing Buffs as well so everything has been trending in fizz's favor the only matchups you really gotta worry about when playing Fizz are Vlad and Pantheon Vlad is being played slightly more than Panther right now so he would be the better value banned for 13.9 a lot of the time how the first two levels play out will determine how hard you're able to carry with fizz in most matchups you want to let the enemy push into you stay healthy until Level 3 and then when you hit the spike look to trade as the wave will be on your side of the lane giving up a few CS throughout the first two levels is completely fine you just want to make sure that when you hit Level 3 you're healthy enough to where you can start trading core build for Fizz consists of eludin's rush into lichbane's second and zanya's third you'll want to grab electrocute with Sudden Impact eyeball collection and ingenious Hunter for primary runes Triumph and coup de gras work best for secondaries our second Solo Carry mid of the patch has one of the best and easiest to execute early games for any mid being Panther on the point click stun combined with the damage reduction from E gives Pantheon one of the most lethal yet simple trading patterns in the game in melee matchups if you can play around e cooldown there is literally no way you should ever be losing a trade this early game dominance that Pantheon can exert combined with his exceptional roaming power from Ultimate makes him such a potent solo Q mid at level 6 you never want to be freezing waves with Pam look to shove and constantly be exerting pressure with the threat of your R players will always Force plays and disrespect Pantheon's ultimate so it gives you amazing counter play as you can show up to fights well before the enemy mid Ari is a pretty good band for Panther right now as her prominence in meta and being a ranged character with high Mobility don't bode well for Pantheon build for panth is an eclipse rush into Black Cleaver second and Spear of shojin Third Run press the attack for the Keystone Rune with Triumph tenacity and coup de gras Sudden Impact and treasure hunter are for secondaries for the third Solo Carry mid laner of the patch we have Ari Ari is one of the most reliable mid lane Champs you can play right now as she doesn't really get hard countered by anything and can always impact games Post 6 with her incredible catch power yaso and Fizz are two matchups that can be a little more difficult as they have ways to dodge out on your skill shots quite easily so Banning one of them is a good idea Landing charm straight up when Envision of the enemy is not the easiest thing to do so to maximize carry power on Ari playing around fog of war is key patiently waiting in Brush for the enemy to either overextend too far or walk right into you is going to drastically increase your impact with Ari you want to make the enemy feel safe but since Arya is incredibly High Mobility with her ultimate the enemy is really never safe if you're lurking in the brush core build for Ari is an Ever Frost rush into Shadow flame second and ramadan's third take electrocute for the Keystone Rune with Taste of blood eyeball collection and ultimate Hunter manaflow and Transcendence are for secondaries with jinx nerfed this patch the playing field is going to be wide open for ADC with many picks being great options including twitch twitch is loving the current Meadow where we have so many supports being played that synergize amazing with him rakan twitch combo is absolutely disgusting and Recon is one of the most played supports Lulu and milio also pair amazing with twitch and they are the second and third most played support Sports if you can play a good twitch especially now that Jinx has been nerfed you have a ton of carry potential in 13.9 you gotta be taking advantage of twitch's incredible pick power to see the greatest success on him being proactive with Q looking for picks when coming back to Lane using it for roam plays mid lane and finding catch plays in the mid to late game or why twitch can be so deadly for solo queue Zaya being a champ who can negate a lot of your pick power due to her ultimate is one of the better bands for twitch core build is a blade of the ruined King rush into Kraken Slayer second and infinity edge or hurricane Third Run lethal Tempo with presence of Mind alacrity and coup de gras for primary runes free boots and biscuits work best for secondaries the rise of these hyper scaling adcs have been in full effect over the past few patches as kog'maw is our second Solo Carry Buff's last patch of putcog in a great spot and many pro players have even been picking him back up in solo queue our Challenger ADC 6X has a brand new full game commentary for kog'maw on our website if you're looking to learn the pick it's no secret Cog has some of the most ridiculous DPS power for any ADC as it's always been his lack of survivability that has plagued him the most in season 13 seen though where ghosts has become meta on ABCs it's made it a lot easier and more reliable to carry on these marksmen who lack a gap closer tracking your ghost cooldown and changing the way you look to approach fights depending on if it's up or down is key to winning on Cog for other adcs like Tristana or vayne who have great Mobility playing around Summoner spell cooldowns aren't as important but for someone like kog'maw you've really got to adapt how you play based on if you have sums or not since Cog is most vulnerable to heavy dive comps Banning a meta engage champ like Jarvan or malphite is a good idea there are so many viable builds for Cog but one that you can't really go wrong with is a blade of the ruined King rush into rage blade second and wits and third as her ruins it's lethal Tempo with Triumph alacrity and last stand for primaries followed by conditioning and overgrowth for secondaries despite the Nerf this patch holding on to a spot in our top three for ADC is going to be jinx jinx will no longer be the Standalone best ADC anymore but she's definitely not leaving The Meta either when paired with an enchanter support like milio Lulu or Janna there's no other ADC I'd rather have on my team than Jinx the team fight power and ability to clean up fights is second to none although Jinx lacks a gap closer her passive can turn her into one of the most slippery adcs in the game when you have Flash and ghost available you want to be team fighting with Jinx her long range DPS power from fish bones and Mobility from Ghost provides you with incredible 5v5 power there's really no point in Banning another ADC when playing Jinx spending your ban on a hard engage champ like Recon or Jarvan is better value Kraken and infinity edge are core pickups for Jinx but your Zeal item really depends on preference as fire Cannon hurricane and phantom dancer are all viable lethal Tempo is the Keystone Rune with presence of Mind bloodline and cut down absolute focus and Gathering storm are for secondaries play making supports are always going to be extremely impactful for solo queue and Recon is the best for the current meta the engage power and disruption built into recon's kit allows him to punish positional mistakes in an instant although diving the back line may be the optimal play in a lot of situations really good Recon players adapt based on the enemy composition Recon is such great catch power but his peel power is just as potent if the enemy comp has a ton of squishy ranged Champions diving in on them is often the best way to play fights on the other hand if the enemy comp consists of mainly melee assassins or dive Champs sitting back and peeling for your fed ADC may be the better option after all diving the back line means absolutely nothing if your ADC is left alone and you have no DPS to actually follow up when you're engaged knowing when to go on the aggression and when to sit back and peel is one of the most difficult parts of mastering Recon but when you get it down he's such a versatile champ core build for Recon is a shorelius rush into Redemption second and wardstone third Rune page consists of Guardian with font of Life bone plating and unflinching followed by zombie Ward and ultimate Hunter the best enchanter support for yet another patch is going to be milio the excessive amount of impactful utility built in Emilio's kit makes him one of the best supports at empowering a Fed carry paramilio up with Jinx and you have one of the most broken team fight Duos to exist matchup wise for Emilio he has a more difficult time against Champions with instant pick power so blitzcrank is one of the better ban options it's really not that difficult to be consistently effective on Emilio as sticking with your fed carry using point-and-click shields on them and cleansing any CC that comes their way is pretty simple to do shiralia's into Arden is such a nasty two item core while Redemption and staff flowing water are both great third options the Rune page is Airy with manaflow Transcendence and Gathering storm optimal secondaries include bone plating and Revitalize to round out the top three for support and our final Solo Carry selection of the patch is Senna when it comes down to Raw Solo Carry power from the support role nobody beats Santa right now her scaling power is incredibly strong and with your focus in the early game being around collecting as many Souls as possible she can be a ridiculous damage threat actively trading and not missing your windows of opportunity is very important to picking up these Souls of course you'll just passively gain Souls from Minions dying but you can also secure them by trading so punishing the enemy ADC when they go for last hit is vital Santa being a squishier champ without a gap closer is more vulnerable into melee hook supports so Blitz or Pike are two good ban options the core build for Senna is an umbral glaive rush into Eclipse second and Rapid Fire Cannon third grab Fleet for the Keystone Rune with presence of Mind alacrity and cut down bone inflating and reviting idolize are great for secondaries alright guys before we wrap this up let's tell you a little more about skill cap so we offer a five division rank up guarantee and think that's a pretty crazy thing to offer it's like a gym membership guaranteeing you'll get ripped your local gym would go bust if they offered that right not us we've offered this for years because our service really does work it works so well in fact that we're able to produce by far the largest catalog of Premium League guides on the internet we add over 20 videos a week with over 1600 guides curated into over 100 courses no one can compare we've also sent Challenger players into ELO hell's 714 times and Counting where they commentate how to carry live they also respond to all questions asked sign up today for as little as 6.99 a month if you are serious about improving so that's gonna wrap up everything for the best solo carries of patch 13.9 thank you guys so much for watching good luck in solo queue and we'll see you back soon ","6":"today we're going over the best champions for every role in patch 13.8 since you guys have been enjoying the new format we'll be going over five categories for each role which are god tier low ELO High ELO underrated and the one to watch out for so without further Ado let's get straight into the video and start off as always with the Top Lane for the Godzilla choice in the Top Lane we just have to go for with no nerves coming in this patch he's still winning way too many games he just has crazy early game damage Mobility survivability with his passive and then he can Roam and slap and stomp the rest of the map once he gets his ultimate clad is the king out playing the top laners and the junglers at the same time and even if the mid laner comes up to party too you can kill them as well if Claire gets fed he just deals so much damage super quickly and every time you think you can get him he just mounts back up and takes you down anyway if you do want some help with clad's best builds and runes and matchups then don't forget to download on desktop app and let us do the hard part for you you can see the most popular build options the highest win rate builds or even you can check out the best builds from your favorite Pros so click the link in the description and see it all for yourself Arlo ELO pick in the Top Lane is maokai who's risen back to popularity in that Top Lane he has tons of durability and sustain to get him through those early levels he can set up ganks like a dream with his point-to-click CC and in terms of scaling into the rest of the game you've basically got a brick wall tank with a ton of damage good sustain and a ridiculous amount of CC to top all of that off the main reason to pick him in low ELO is because he's just so easy to play moving on to high yellow though and we've had to go for rivet Riven is one of the scariest top laners in the game if they're being played by someone who really knows how to utilize her she just has a crazy Mobility Relentless damage tons of different Combos and animation canceling mechanics that you can put together to outplay your enemies and if you do get too many kills in the early levels or even if you just Farm up and scale you can split push you can Side Lane you can flank Beyond teams and clean up fights in a matter of seconds the time you spend learning Rhythm will definitely be rewarded and before you know it you'll be diving into teams flashing in with that third Q lining up a perfect ultimate and one shutting the entire backline speaking of diving into backlines the underrated pick to go for in the Top Lane this week is Zach now in the last year Zach has definitely not been underrated but people have stopped playing him in the Top Lane and for no real good reason it starts off in early levels with ridiculous sustain with those blobs and it's really hard to outrade it he can jump onto you whenever he wants with his e and if you don't have any cc to stop it you can't really avoid it unless you've really got those Happy Feet going he can set up ganks in that Top Lane for his jungle with his CC and if that doesn't work out well he can just roam to mid lane roam to bot Lane and carry the rest of the map instead we all know just how good Zack is when it comes to T fights as well with his crazy disruption insane sustain mental damage and even if he does die he's still got that passive to get through too moving on to our final Top Lane pick of this patch which is the one to watch out for which is gonna have to be poppy now poppy was already in a really good spot but Roy have actually buffed her this patch too and now she's probably gonna be a bit broken poppy has so much disruption in her basic ability she's got that W to avoid dashes she's got her cue for burst even her passive Shield is underrated so watch out for that too she can set up ganks just like most of these other Top Lane picks we've gone for her e into walls is so punishing and if any fight doesn't really look too pleasing she discharges up that ultimate and sends the enemies back to the shopkeeper if you like infuriating your enemies with a lot of disruption and CC some surprising damage and some serious anti-mobility then poppy should be someone you're playing let's move move into the jungle now on a Godzilla pick just has to still be each other yes despite the nerve's impact 13.8 Jarvan is still king of the jungle he has tons of early damage great early ganks for that EQ flag and drag combo his ultimate is devastating in team fights and his combination of tankiness durability damage and CC just makes him so much better than anyone else you can play right now we definitely expect some more nerves coming to Jarvan in the next few patches but for the time being keep playing him keep abusing him and keep getting that free LP Arlo ELO pick in the jungle is not to every single patch this season Nocturne has flown under the radar and he's boasted a really impressive win read throughout Nocturne snowballs like a monster his ganks are devastating with that ultimate and those spell Shields and fear tethers can be really strong too Nocturne has a variety of builds to go for you can go glass Cannon axiomark Edge Of Night assassin you can go for a stride breaker Bruiser But whichever one you go for you are seriously going to be a problem if you do get a bit too fed in the early game Nocturne is a really easy Champion to play which is why we've put him in the low you know this week but there are still things you can do when you get good at him like those perfect timing spell Shields or even those drive by smites with your ultimate if you haven't really tried him yet this season then seriously you should definitely give him a go he's a great pick and he could be your ticket out of your help for High ELO we've got to go for the Recently buff nidalee she's always been a champion capable of destroying games before they even get started if she's being played by the right person from kyton camps to spearing people in gangs to jumping in and pouncing and biting their noses off nidalee can get super duper fed super quickly get damage soul stealer stacked up and start one-shotting people with those spits nidalee is one of those Champions that you get massively rewarded when you put some time into her she is not easy to play she's not easy to be in platform because of her unique play Star but if you are a bit of a jungle demon in haila you know how to punish the enemy jungle you know has her in Vegas has a gank and keep Tempo this patch is the perfect time to bring nidalee back out of the locker another recently buffed Champion takes are underrated spot this week and it's gonna have to be Lilia the prancing dancing queen of the river is back in the jungle and much better than people realize she can dance in and out of fights and kite with that movement speed and healing and if you do manage to land that five-man sleep on Lilia in a big clutch late game team fight the chances of winning it are going to be extremely high Lilia does a surprising amount of damage but she's also fairly durable depending on which item build she goes for she can go full AP AP Bruiser or even a bit more tanky But whichever build you decide to go for you should definitely start to play linear again finally I want to watch out for in the jungle just has to be Fiddlesticks now to be honest we could also put him in the gods here but he's just not quite as popular as Java but when you do see Fiddlesticks you definitely remember why he's so damn scary Fiddlesticks has a ridiculous amount of CC he has sustained with his drain at Great damage but the most important thing to think about when playing or playing against Fiddlesticks is playing around his ultimate yes the crow storm just allows him to carry games from obscure angles and dive into teams and kill everybody on his own and if he does get a few too many kills and gets those items sooner rather than later he can genuinely 1v5 objective pits confined spaces in the jungle and everything else like that are his best friend so so if you are playing against Fiddlesticks you need to always be wary of where he could be because ahead or behind one good ultimate is all it takes for Fiddlesticks to win the game anyway moving into the mid lane now and of course our God to choice just has to be Annie she is absolutely everywhere right now at every single Rank and winning a stupid amount of games she's great in the name face you can bully with those cues she can set up ganks with her stunts and then once she gets level 6 the world is her oyster one big flash tip is is all it takes to win any team fight or you can just use it to burst down a specific enemy Target like the 80 Carrick she does so much damage on team fights but she also brings her Shield to the table too for that bonus movement speed and of course massive amounts of AOE damage in CC the Nerfs you got recently didn't really make too much of a difference and she's still easily one of the best champions in the game in two different roles so if you aren't playing any yet why not our low ELO pick in the mid lane just has to be Pantheon and yet another champion who probably should have been nerfed in patch 13.8 Pantheon just wins so many lanes and if he does win Lane he Stomps and snowballs at a ridiculous Pace he can shut down low range match up super easily with that W and E he can poke longer range matchups into kill range with his q and he can roam around the map with that ultimate carry Lanes carry games and just get super involved at all times he also has a variety of different builds you can go for you can go for that play the Rune King Black Cleaver tank destroyer or you can go full glass Cannon and just one shot they're already carry every time they pop up on the map however you decide to play him wherever you decide to play him you can't go wrong with Pantheon right now for High ELO we've gone for Zoe he got buffed in patch 13.8 Zoe is already in a respectable spot but now she's just a little bit borderline broken yes the champion with about 17 flashes every single team fight is back and picking people off left right and Center she has great burst damage amazing pick potential solid mobility and just a ridiculous amount of utility too with all those different Summoner spells and item acts if she can use in fights Zoe definitely takes some practice to play which is why she fits better into the High ELO category but honestly if you do know what you're doing the enemies probably don't know how to play against you so if you have got a bit of practice on Zoe now's the best time to abuse her for our underrated pick in the mid lane this week we've gone for a bit of a surprising one yes Canon the electric yodel is actually in a really good spot in the mid lane and has been for a few patches now now you can pick him Top Lane into certain matchups that you can abuse but actually if you just go mid lane you just run at them with your ultimate setup gank set up fights and you're always going to be there for those Dragon team fights early game you just have so much AOE damage and CC and that's the main reason why he's popping off so much you get stuck in as often as you can around your jungler around your teammates and if you do get fed you just press that e-charge towards them press your ultimate stun them down knock them down with your shurikens and Gigi well played he's definitely a bit more of a niche pick than some of the other Champions on this video but if you haven't tried him yet please give him a go because it may surprise you how good he can be finally I want to watch out for in the mid lane is Fizz now Fizz has slowly but surely been creeping his way back into the meta and every time you play against Fizz and you've not got a great matchup you realize how punishing he can be to play against fizzizzy just makes him so hard to punish but it also brings him so much damage as well the Q shot combo can be so hard to predict and it can be so devastating if he gets ahead of you in the late base it's not just about diving and killing Lanes though because you can roam around the map as his kit is so good at ganking as well so next time you see a skill shot heavywave creating Mage in the mid lane pick Fizz get level 6 press your ultimate take them down and snowball your way to an easy win moving on to the 80 carries now and in the gods here we still have Jinx she took this spot last time around but guess what she didn't get nerfed so she's gonna take it again to be honest when Jinx is in a good spot it's hard to really understand why you'd want to play anyone else because despite having a bit of a rough early game sometimes in certain Lanes she just scales and slaps team fights like no other the long range AOE Splash damage from Team fights the crazy passive resets and of course the sniper potential with your W and ultimate mean that you're a bit of a monster and if you do get left unchecked on a team fight with an enchanter by your side you can clean up anyone without any problems Jinx that has to be careful with all those hard engaging diving tanks that are in the game right now but as long as you can position yourself properly and kite to your heart's content that you're going to have a ton of fun and you're probably gonna win more games than on any other 80 carry although ELO pick though is gonna have to be Zaya who's also really not too shabby right now Zaya is fantastic when kiting backwards with those feathers and she can lead to entire teams with that ultimate Ecom but she has great poke in the lane phase two she also works really well with most different supports especially for Khan if you pop that W level one you're probably not gonna lose the fight when it comes to team fights your ultimate makes you so hard to punish because it's one of the best defensive abilities for any 80 carry and if the early game does go to plan by the time he gets team fights you're gonna deal so much damage they're gonna have to focus you and before you know it you've landed a full five-man feather combo Zaya has been great for the last few patches so if you aren't playing her in low ELO why not for height you know we've gone for the Recently buffed Ezreal if you haven't seen a high yellow talented Ezra 1 Trick In Action then you are seriously missing out because this is some of the most impressive stuff you can see Ezreal has Relentless poke damage and Relentless Mobility at the same time it's one of the reasons why he's always been such a popular and safe pick to go for if you're an average Ezreal he's just not really that impactful but if you're an absolute God on him then he's better than most Eddie carries in the game he's got long range damage he's got close range burst he's got Snipes he's got poke he's got everything you need to kite around the rift and just destroy everyone Ezreal is just such a consistent and flexible Champion to go for in high heeler you can pick it with basically any support whether it's aggressive whether it's defensive or even whether it's a uni so if you are an 80 carry Main and looking for someone new to one trick going into High ELO maybe consider picking up ezrael again an underrated pick to go for in the bot Lane is Heimerdinger he's genuinely underrated on like four different roles but actually it's his 80 carry win rate that is the most surprising Heimerdinger has fantastic push potential Relentless poke damage he wins short burst he treats he wins long extended fights he can set up ganks with those stuns and if you try and gank him he pops his ultimate and laughs as you run through those turrets and kills you all habanina does have a pretty Niche and unique play Star he's all about taking plates taking names and taking enemies hostage heimening it is probably one of the most underestimated champions in the game every single week his damage is surprising so is his utility and so is his ability to absolutely tear through structures if you want to tear through teams instead though you probably want to go for the one to watch out for which is kog'maw he's been a little bit underrated for a while he's been a bit too situational probably but with the Buffs that came in this week he's actually gone a little bit too strong now kogmore may still be dependent on those enchanters and those comps to fit into but if you get him into the right one he is unbelievably good cold War's kiting and DPS in team fights is one thing but it's his ability to tear through any type of Target that really makes him so scary and if you do lack the reliable cc to lock him down in a team fight and shut him down if he has the chance to he will melt entire teams without too much issue finally let's move on to support now and our God to choice just has to be rakat the most Mobile support in the game with the biggest potential is still running riots and his ability to dive into backlines and lock down teams is still just as good as ever he can Dash and dive and initiate an escape and disengage and everything else along that goes with it he's got heals he's got Shields he's got utility he really does have it all and despite getting nerfed in patch 13.8 he's still the best choice to go for rakan works well alongside most Eddie carries he works good against most enemy team comps and you just really can't go too far rock as long as you have got the skills to pull him off consistently moving on to our home relo pick we've gone for melio this week namilio is just so oppressive and so easy to be impactful lot even if you're struggling to land those cues your we and ultimate's utility will be more than enough to make your mark on any game milio also just works so well with those top 80 carries I mean melio Jinx is one of the most terrifying Lanes in the game to play against right now and whether you get ahead with that bonus range in healing in lane or whether you just play for those massive team fights where you can really put your enchanter skills to the test melio is just working wonders throughout all parts of the game and by the way he's pretty damn easy to pick up and play making him perfect in low ELO for High ELO though we've gone for center now Center does take a bit more practice to play consistently well in team fights because she is insanely squishy but she more than makes up for it with her crazy long-range damage good sustain and poke in lane and ridiculous scaling if you manage to stack up those Souls by the time it gets to late game you're gonna be able to roll to attack people from Super far away and they will do some serious damage too aside from that damage though Center also offers so much and brings so much to the table her cue is great at poking and sustaining through her teammates her W is brilliant at locking down enemies and escaping bad fights her he is great to disengage or engage in with your jungle with that invisibility and by the way if enemies have points and click spells they genuinely can't hit you when you use your e then of course you've also got your across the map ultimate to dish out tons of damage and shields to your teammates so what's not to like if you're good enough to position like a beast and really maximize your damage output and utility output then Senna is a top pick to play this patch moving on to our underrated support and for the second time featured in this video it's Malco now of course maokai's playstyle in the support is different to that of the Top Lane but he still brings a lot of the same obnoxious straight to the table which are incredible CC brilliant ways to set up gangs and fights and fantastic impact throughout all stages of the game now maokai's support is all about jumping onto enemies with his W and knocking them back into his 80 carry he packs a lot more damage than people realize and the W is so punishing to play against if you don't have flash available if you can't find kills is in the lane you can just roam up to the mid lane and gank there you can party up with your jungler and run around the river or you can wait for those big dragon fights and land a five-man ultimate maokai support is still just as strong as ever so if you haven't been playing it recently here's a reminder to pick it back up again finally our support to watch out for and the last champion featured in this video today is Alistair yet another buff came in for Alistair in patch 13.8 and now it's really the time for the cow to shine alistair's cc is just as good at engaging as it is at disengaging he's brilliant appealing for his 80 carry but he's also fantastic at diving turrets taking down enemies and just popping that ultimate and tanking it all fine the top Alistair players really know how to punish the rest of the map too though you hex flash over Raptors wall and knock them back into your mid laner and that's gonna be a free kill every single time from Tower diving in the lane base to Relentless crowd control in team fights to peeling like an absolute Beast if you know how to land those WQ combos consistently Alistair is one of the best supports you can play right now and on that note that brings us to the end of our you all about the best champions for all roles in patch 13.8 we hope you all enjoyed the video and let us know in

thanks for watching and we'll see you next time take care ","7":null,"8":"13.8 has brought forth a nice shift in meta with every single role seeing a new pick emerge with the help of our Challenger players and analyzing the most recent data we are ready to bring you guys a complete update on the solo Q meta but before we get into it be sure to check out skill cap if you want to truly get better

work and if it doesn't work for you you shouldn't pay learn more at the end of this video or click the link in the description below one Top Lane champion who has definitely exceeded our expectations analytically and is dominated in competition for 13.8 is Poppy Buffs this patch have been incredible and when you dive into how the current Top Lane meta is aligned poppy fits in extremely well Jace Jax Fiora Riven and Camille are all Champions picked a lot right now and Poppy obliterates all of them by rushing Divine sunderer you have amazing early game snowball power but from then on out it's full tank allowing you to be a really good disrupter in team fights when it comes down to a consistently strong blind pick up for 13.8 there are a few better options than Poppy and she will be making the jump into our Top Lane op tier a second top laner who is making a great push back into meta right now is mordekaiser more does fall off a bit in the higher ranks but for diamond and Below he's one of the more optimal top laners similar to Poppy Moore is able to build a mix of offensive and defensive items allowing him to thrive in extended fights Mort has always played super well into tankier Champs because of this and with malphite and Scion played very heavily in the current meta it gives more Great Value mordekaiser will be joining Poppy and making the jump up into the Top Lane optier for 13.8 taking a look at the Top Lane tier list there are a bunch of really strong Champions the op tier consists of mordekaiser poppy Shen malphite and Pantheon you got a nice mix of everything to choose from right now and could easily construct a Top Lane champion pool with just the op tier Opie Shannon malphite are all great reliable tank options while Pantheon is your best ad fighter and mord is the best AP Fighter the best low ELO champs for Top Lane are Yorick Dr Mundo and NASA's best Top Lane bands of the patch include Fiora Darius and malfun it appears Riot may have overshot with the kha'zix Buffs this patch as he has seen a huge spike in play rate and win rate generally speaking when the play rate of a champion doubles in one patch you'd expect for them to suffer win rate wise due to new players picking up the champ but this has not been the case at all though with kha'zix this patch which just goes to show how impactful the Buffs were if you're looking to pick up kha'zix and want to learn more about the pick our Challenger jungler Japanese import has a brand new full game commentary for kha'zix on our website when it comes down to that pure carry jungler in 13.8 nobody is tapping kha'zix and he will be making a move into the jungle op tier although this Champion is usually more commonly played in The Top Lane jungle poppy has become significantly stronger this patch as well much like poppy Top Lane jungle poppy has incredibly good matchups for the current meta if you're having issues with pics of Lee sin Graves Kane or hecarim then poppy is your answer as long as you don't get heart stomped early on every single one of those Champs are super limited as to how they can approach team fights of the poppy in the game your W and R do such an amazing job at keeping them away from your carries and halting any engage play they try for when most people think of poppy what likely comes to mind is this tanky disrupter Champion but with a Divine sunderer rush and dark harvest in runes you pose a legitimate carry threat even better is that most players have no clue of Poppy's limit so they'll be surprised as to how powerful you are in skirmishes just like Top Lane poppy we will be giving jungle poppy another bump up the tier list going from a into s for 13.8 for the jungle tier list we're looking at kha'zix Fiddlesticks Evelyn and Jarvan being the most powerful carries of the pack Nerfs to Jarvan have played out exactly as expected as he has lost a tiny bit of power but not enough to Warrant a move out of the op tier Kane Nerfs on the other hand have hit him a bit more than anticipated and have shifted him from s into a tier as a result nidalee Buffs have been quite impactful as well especially for the higher elos If This Were a tearless catered towards Challenger and pro play Then Italy would definitely be S tier or above but since we structure our tier lists around what's best for diamond and below and solo queue nidalee remains in our jungle a tier the optimal low ELO junglers of the patch are Fiddlesticks mordekaiser and Nocturne Evelyn kha'zix and Jarvan are the highest priority bands with the cosmic Drive Buffs this patch so far one of the biggest winners that Pros are spamming the item on is Cassiopeia Cass being a champion who needs to position immaculately in fights benefits immensely from the 20 movement speed boost the new cosmic Drive provides so far Cosmic is casio's highest win rate third purchase this patch and pro mid laner caps has been picking it up in that item slot as well the three item Spike of Rod archangels and Cosmic Drive synergizes insanely well with how Casio wants to play and we will be giving her the push into optier as a result a bit more of a niche mid lane pick but one worth mentioning for 13.8 is AP kog'maw Cog saw a couple of buses patch which help out the early game of apcog and has resulted in about a one percent Spike to his mid lane win rank as a counterpick to Shorter range Mages like Victor aurelian Seoul Annie and Cassiopeia Cog can actually work quite well he's not much more than that though as blind picking Cog and going up against any meta assassin is not an easy task due to the champion lacking any sort of Mobility or peel power so if you've played some apcog in the past or just want a new MID laner to try in 13.8 kogmon mid is definitely a viable pick just not an optimal carry we would highly recommend breaking down the mid lane tier list for the optr we have Ari Pantheon Annie and Cassiopeia leading the way aurelian Soul nurse have panned out how we anticipated with the champion losing more power in low ELO than in High ELO but still being a phenomenal low ELO pick regardless since a soul was the only mid laner change for 13.8 nothing major going on in regards to shifts to the mid lane meta top three low ELO mid lane recommendations are vegar aurelian soul and Annie the most banworthy mid lane champions of the patch are Annie Zed and Fizz an ADC who has seen a nice spike in power this patch more than originally expected and moving up the tier list is Ezreal the base ad buff is actually more impactful for a champion like Ezreal due to the fact he runs Trinity Force the win rate of Trinity forces increased significantly more than Essence Reaver for this patch because it has two passives that scale off your base A.D the three-fold strike passive on Trinity Force increases base attack damage by four percent while the spellblade passive scales off 200 of your base A.D ezrael players rushing Trinity force in 13.7 were winning 50 percent of the time but it's now shut up to 52 due to this buff only 16 percent of Ezreal players are actually running Trinity though despite it heavily outperforming Essence Reaver Essence Reaver Rush Ezreal is about an a-tier ADC for 13.8 but Trinity Ezreal is looking really strong so as long as you're running the optimal Build the Champ is now an S tier pick moving forward taking a look at the ADC tier list Jinx will stand alone on top as the only op cheer champ once again below her are some really great options though as XI is super strong kog'maw is extremely underrated after his Buffs Ezreal is now back in meta there's just so many adcs that are now in and around the same power level to climb at a low ELO the fastest from ADC our top three picks are Tristana Miss Fortune and vegar Jinx Zaya and Draven are a few of the best ADC bands for the patch if you're wondering why Tom kench all of a sudden has the highest win rate for any support it's due to a strange bug going around somehow Tom is able to teleport all the way across the map with his W so hopefully this gets patched up soon van deril has made a video on this and as you can see from the footage the Tom kench is able to significantly increase the range of his W going from base all the way up to Top Lane we're not exactly sure how you're supposed to recreate this and even if we did it's not something we'd want to share and have people exploiting in the games anyway just know that Tom's win rate is definitely inflated this patch to this bug or script and he's not actually an OP champ like his win rate may suggest a support who has actually become much stronger without abusing a bug is Jonah as we mentioned in the pre-patch tier list Jonna really didn't need Buffs and with these changes she now is shot up to being one of the best enchanter supports the Buffs even exceeded our initial expectations and we will be pushing Jonah further up the tier list from s into op for the mid patch update Jinx being heavily played in meta is great for someone like Jonah because a jinx on a few items with ajana by her side is practically unkillable and an Unstoppable carry Force we definitely give milio the slight edge up in regards to rock Harry power for an enchanter but Janna is a very close second and a great pickup in 13.8 having a look at the support tier list it's Jana rakan Senna blitzcrank and milio as the highest priority picks much like all the other op Champs who were nerfed in 13.8 rakan has not seen a significant drop in his power level and continues to be a great carry support the best low ELO supports the patch are milio Annie and Zyra Recon thresh and milio are all great ban options due to their High play rates and relative power for the current meta alright guys before we wrap this up let's tell you a little more about skill capped so we offer a five division rank up guarantee and think that's a pretty crazy thing to offer it's like a gym

game so I have to figure out how to stream from a phone and then I have to go set up forbidden Memories okay cool either a tag force people say that Yu-Gi-Oh tag Yugioh GX Tag force is like amazing I've never seen it that endures to the Roses so I don't think that's a card game there he is now Fleet intercept is much preferable but what if no I'm being stupid I was gonna say what if we bursted him no no that's exactly what he wants I think we can get away with this Tempo though is anyone familiar with the game Yu-Gi-Oh forbidden Memories it's a curious case of a Yu-Gi-Oh game being made before Yu-Gi-Oh had rules so they kind of made them up it was also notoriously difficult you'd work your ass off to fuse because that's what you did and then the enemy just kind of slaps down this 3000 attack beat stick they just so happen to have it's quite a game in other news I guess we're also piloting up Top Lane against Nico jungle the Spy so if you aren't aware Nico can now disguise as near enough anything jungle plants monsters minions and Wards apparently yeah all I'm saying is if you see a fourth cast Dominion in the wave be warned can we come in a Lowry tentacle can she become a malzahar voidling you're saying anything with a health bar can she become yorick's Maiden that's kind of funny that is very funny I think I had a plan and forgot about it I was gonna Force the wave to push to me but I said to love punching thing so it tends to be fine anyway there's something about her clones as well like I saw her like a clone galio next to the real Nico do like a spell I don't know how that works you first you first [\u00a0__\u00a0] what purpose is not here right now there he is oh no mishangled missed both targets I'm cannonless killless sadness indulging without true damage here I will not be able to push this in time well I might be able to he doesn't have a doesn't have teleport and we have quite a few casters pushing power is kind of bad enough for this to be not viable though I think it'll just about make it oh the melees will but he gets the XP anyway ah it's fine he gives me time to back let's build let's build standard actually yeah let's build standard we haven't done like a standard game in like ages which apparently means [\u00a0__\u00a0] all uh can I get a long sword I hate the item shop still I really do I need to make another item set which is just every item in the game arranged by cost order did we hear that probably not never miss a Beat is every ability but never a Beat red buff is gone I'm almost being million blocks into a potential set combo that would be fun hey I swear my cue never goes through an IQ set before he hits a I definitely press it before he presses it it just never goes through [Music] I guess I feel like he could be doing a lot more than he's doing there we go took him a while oh he was going for a note there he did a low damage W he has massive priority here and he has all he gives me a soul yo distract me from the cannon but he would have killed me if I tried I can't hit my ward button there we go I hate this [Music] I hate how freaking fast that is I swear I'm casting abilities in time for sepsi let's go is that jungle clear good though because I'd play that I would play jungle Nico wouldn't have before because she was just a lox I could I was like a lizard now she's like looks but like the Spy that's much cooler stop your gun oh I didn't read any jungle specific Buffs then again I didn't read very much foreign that's all I need [Music] I'm trying to wait quite so hard [Music] before tattoos they do have Ezreal and center and set so Tabby's on bad oh yeah touch is that Carolina that's what carrying us fizz nice I might die to minions [Music] foreign didn't let him anyway I guess well it's been a been a while since you thought Titanic all right so you can make the Clone stand still I don't think that's a default option maybe a Miss click trigger tubbies now we got tank anyway [Music] oh I might have just lost Tower by backing yeah no teleport I see all probably demolish and then just punches really fast not gonna make it yeah it's gonna be first hour as well that's huge okay he doesn't have it that's good what is the point I just want to ask you it's cool titanical helpers not lose Tower so that's good [Music] yeah I know they just go where you click it depends what the default option is the default option on a LeBlanc loan is to start running away this Nico clone Stood Still even because it wasn't given orders and that's default or because they ordered Nico's clone to stand still as some kind of double duke or mistake [Music] oh I kind of forgot you can do that for the commitment I was playing around his all until I forgot it existed I could have been really embarrassing if you still had Flash it's very true Berserkers is Extreme was extremely slept on including by me so although I'm not a fan of the Tanki support build ADI does now or did more recently this season poster ability updates and stuff that one uses like um what's the item even shroud in Top Lane it's very boring but he did use berserker's Greaves on his previous one which I think had 43 win rate out of maybe eight games which isn't very much I think we need Jack show right now we can get that later they're showing berserk is green maybe we got something else we need for Senator to hurry up and get 100 Souls in his defense he's not a very good set then again I'm making [\u00a0__\u00a0] tons of mistakes as well like I keep missing my Flay against his E I intend to do it before his e and sometimes Q as well like my EQ against hizzy I keep making these mistakes and I guess we're still doing good so we can't put it all on just set bad greetings Traveler I do hate kind of hate how it's just like oh you'll never minion oh allow me to stun you for like two seconds hey fresh stats are pretty bad actually [Music] the good thing is you do scale so you won't get more armor than vein will by 10 minutes Joe he wants to eat right I want to at least negate it once is she coming up it wasn't quite in a gate okay no everyone is coming up actually I'm not gonna make it but he goes 4-0 and Fizz is five four and I'm poor fresh with no magic resist okay maybe blademan King was the incorrect decision because everyone came top they really don't like me then again I did have a huge bounty on my head yeah um on the topic of that though um vayne beats fresh top wait no fresh top beats veintol by outscaling her isn't that funny just don't embarrass yourself by missing a hook in a fight and limiting your own DPS because that can be really [\u00a0__\u00a0] [\u00a0__\u00a0] case in point you should get oh easy there you go [Music] you got a tower though not worth know what she's doing you're managed to take this by the time I recall and teleport I just need to figure out what the heck I'm buying straight away I guess just Jack show stuff oh he will take the telephone your true damage means nothing the other Tower though again not worth we evened out so it's one for two on the towers and I guess we got Cena and set that doesn't sound very worth it coming up size [Music] send us a joke unfortunately she doesn't have 100 songs yet we are ahead on dragons we have a nice team comp now that Nico doesn't get her shield on her ultimate anymore it's valuable that we can just kill her before she's able to drop it Maybe he's alive none of them just said foreign he wanted that but this is fine we damage means fuckle oh wait no [Music] hello dude is there that whole team basically don't teleport right now for making time and I'm quite low still a bit lacking a magic resist you'll push this we call defend bot nice ready in gaming radiant scaling you're a big tanky boy yeah I should be able to do stuff about this guy in fact I might just rush after him he hasn't got on for it yet not on both surrounders will he go over the wall he's really using everything huh ghost is running out ghost run out you'll see don't haha there's a dude here that's Nico uh I couldn't see I just saw the health bar this is in thing I'm ending right now nice maybe consider Nash's tooth there's not much reason though the on-hit damage that an ashes to forgive us at this point is not going to be even at wit's end level in which end will give us more durability against the AP damage they have and that durability means more time alive more time to actually do DPS we'd get more burst but it's the point also when you start dividing between a d and AP when you're full ad then you don't need to care too much about maximizing your damage out of your abilities but when you've invested AP then you'd start having to do it and you have to like save things for combos save hooks for damage that kind of deal so there's not much point in going ashes but you could you could for fun at this moment um actually it's probably best if we just keep going tank but I'm gonna let uh Warwick do that will I buy wit's end I can't tell what's going on right now oh that's sad come on you know you want to fight God the W came back up how do you get so many hot steel Stacks what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] I thought he would have W didn't previous fight he doesn't have that much ability haste okay maybe he does we might have been able to win that if we stood still because of Fresh's DPS me trying to kite away from Senna actually limited the attack speed I could use so assuming his W only just came back up in that moment we would have won if we just Stood Still by maxing DPS Cena's damage was probably insignificant at this stage either way that's a sign if I'm losing to set I need more souls I don't think he wins in a 1v1 though unless I played terribly I think I have every availability of doing excess mid we'll get him this time looks like he's already popped up no no that's a w right there big tree damage we just have to sidestep it I didn't tried side safer earlier because I was trying to Max DPS to kill him because I didn't think he'd have one oh stop this Dash I'm taking so much damage though I did my job I tanked and I took fizz a little bit of papping there I felt that he does not have surreal orders yet but this is still a struggle the Nami move speed gonna come in unfortunately it looks like the Q was misclicked onto a Caster minion play ocarina they're gonna have a bad time foreign excellent he's getting so much out of that heart seal unfortunately there are no tuning bags on Ocarina I could break it that would unit damn it I thought that would despawn by then that's only gonna okay I was gonna say no one's No One's Gonna get hit by that but then I saw Nami that second too slow overall we're still winning we just need a little more anti-set health is a great idea either that will just move speed [Music] or both [Music] getting move speed into this guy because he's about to finish his welders it may not move speed unfortunately there is no such thing as slow resistance in this game you can just do that it's kind of insane still feel like I'm low on Souls [Music] foreign how's Israel right he missed completely with his W and good those who could easily take that out it's fine enough Now where's Santa's soul [Music] Santa does not have 100 Souls yet that literally just red Fizz I think it is isn't it yeah Scorch chroma I suppose we're all down here it's slowly starting to respawn has a big hole that's a a very big hole literally and that's also ignore you should be able to get this before anyone arrives so he's on his way but that's okay is yours on his way freaking hip nice there we go minions what am I buying oh no he died oh he got executed you got executed for the shield [Music] thank you that's a cue status uh this might be last game to be honest Maybe possibly at this point do we go rageblade I mean we got so many on hits I'm gonna get runans I think we're fighting solo people more than we fight a group foreign using more than a singular minimum brain cell requirement to play league is a little bit toxic at this point do I just win the game instead of seven points out I do have a bound though I think I do send a record foreign we would have just pushed to win after right [Music] ","10":"ever since its Inception there's been a meta within League of Legends a set of unspoken rules and standards for how the game should be optimally played as is the case for every competitive and even non-competitive game the community and occasionally the developers themselves collect information empirical data and statistics to determine what is strong and efficient and what is weak and impractical that in its simplest form is what a meta is given that Riot implements balance adjustments on a bi-weekly basis the relative strength and effectiveness of Champions items and in-game systems are constantly changing forcing players to remain adaptive and up to date at all times within the overarching meta exists many smaller metas namely between ranks what is considered optimal in silver for instance May vastly differ from what is optimal in Challenger due to the variance in steel expression mechanics and macronology of the game working for or against the Champion's proficiency it's almost a governing law that the best way to climb is to follow the meta take advantage of whoever and whatever is wrong to increase your chances of winning but time after time in the almost 14 years the game has been out for a small fraction of players have proven that it's still possible to find success at even the upper echelons of solo queue utilizing a strategy that doesn't follow prevailing wisdom sometimes this Divergent approach to the game ironically Finds Its way into mainstream relevance having made a video on off meta being creative or troll back in 2021 I want to revisit this topic and go a bit more in depth on it by breaking down what exactly is the difference between a genuinely viable off meta strategy and a blatant troll pick that being said I highly suggest you watch that video If you haven't yet as it talks about the pros and console playing off meta whereas in this one my aim is to help you better understand what is a creative unorthodox playstyle and what is played in the ante unsurprisingly when it comes to off meta everyone has a differing opinion no matter how much evidence to the contrary there will always be that one person who Advocates Yumi jungle being the most OP freelo strategy you can think of on the flip side there may be someone who believes there is no such thing as a viable off meta strategy because if it's viable it's considered meta both sides are correct in a way historically speaking metas are known for their impermanence regardless of what game you play even the title that never has a single balance patch can run through dozens of iterations on tier lists as the competitive scene matures and develops Super Smash Bros melee is the most appropriate example of this the most recent official quote-unquote tier list came out back in March 2021 placing Yoshi at Rank 10 and Jigglypuff at rank 3. but at one point way back in October of 2002 Jigglypuff and Yoshi were ranked 17 and 19 respectively placements that would be considered low tier just because the strategy or character is perceived as bad by the general public doesn't mean they're actually some it could just stem from a lack of experimentation and exploration or inconclusive data then again the term meta implies efficiency therefore if there's a deviant strategy that is successful it is in fact a meta strategy just not one many people know about a good friend of mine and fellow content creator happy chime noises based his entire Channel around off metapix that garnered enough success for a place to reach Master Grand Master even Challenger featuring picks that range from reasonable such as full crit ad Olaf to the most outlandish pick and build you could ever think of like Jon and top funnily enough some of this video just became viral enough that set off meta strategy achieved mainstream attention to the point where Riot themselves had to do something about it in fact after releasing his videos on Yumi Jana and Rick on top the bounce team had to completely readjust support items namely spell thief's edge to only work if an Allied Champion was nearby one could argue that there is simultaneously a meta and no meta at all but that's really what metasar in video games an abstract set of methods and Trends among those who played them if we really want to be technical about it there is no such thing as a troll pick since anything can work obviously that's not the answer you want to hear though neither do I the last thing I want is for some idiot to justify install locking full AP Drive in mid because they want to be the next vile thing on Reddit no matter how many off metapix or strategies are discovered they're innately less sufficient than meta strategies for many reasons to understand what constitutes viable off meta you have to be in the meta first unlike what most people think you can't just go on Ultimate bravery and try out a random Champion into a random role with the random builds and hope for the best if we were that easy everyone would do it saying that the majority of Love matters are objectively less sufficient than the on metas for example a video Chimes made earlier this year was on A.D stylus what do we know about Silas for One Piece primarily nap skirmisher chain lash is a damaging skill shot with a 130 AP ratio kingslayer is a targeted Dash whose damage and healing skill of 90 and 80 AP respectively abduct is a bandage toss Dash likability with the 100 AP ratio all of his basic abilities require ability power but as I'm sure we all know a good amount of his DPS comes from petrocyte burst transforming his basic attack to deal AOE damage to all nearby Targets after using an ability giving a bonus attack speed while in possession attacks and having a 130 ad plus 25 EP ratio on the primary target and 40 plus 20 to non-primary targets it doesn't take a genius to figure out that ability power is measurably more effective to build than attack damage as his entire kids skills off ability power whereas one scales off a d however he does naturally weave in Auto attacks between his abilities therefore he can take advantage of any on-hit Android us below properties as demonstrated in this video where he runs blade of the ruined King Divine Sunder and muramana none of these items are nearly as useful on him compared to an actual on-hit attacker like say Jax or irelia but there is a semblance of synergy bringing us to Step One does the build make sense another example I want to look at is full crit Olaf where you go Immortal Shield bow collector and Divinity Edge once again crit chance isn't really the most ideal stat to build on Olaf seeing as he's in a mobile Juggernaut whose damage output is evenly split between abilities and auto attacks and he tends to get kited really hard unless you build stride breaker although Olaf is notorious for gaining ludicrous amounts of attack speed from his passive and W letting him basically reach the attack speed cap without building a single item with that stat if you also factor in his ultimate granting and boss attack damage when activated it's very common for Olaf to reach 400 500 even 600 A.D towards the lakium mostly carry yourself only around 300 since they have to build the tax lead full crit Olaf does basically like a thousand damage per Auto with only like 3 completed items it's a risky strategy given your forfeiting defensive stats that he desperately needs but the potential is still there Above All Else the build has to make sense you can't go AP Darius because he has no EB ratios and nothing in his kit takes advantage of AP items enough to even be worth considering on to step two do the circumstances make sense and this is where I think a lot of players fail to differentiate clever off meta from dumb as [\u00a0__\u00a0] every Champion finds a home in one of the five roles despite there being no rule and post on them from the game that Apple leads you to put them there Evelyn's a jungler because her camouflage lost her to sneak into other lanes and catch enemy laners off guard viewers the top laner because the isolated 1v1 nature of Top Lane suits your play style quite well millions of support because well I mean it's pretty obvious he wants to swim with a buddy but that doesn't mean that's the only place you can use them Renekton is the champion you frequently see in Top Lane but every so often he might make his way into mid lane why two things one he has a really good burst trade combo that's usually strong enough to one shot or at the very least Gravely wounded his opponent with only a few items more often than not here trades most Mages two he's an anti-carry extremely good at shutting down most if not every assassin in the mid lane Echo Kiana Yasuo Katarina akali Yana casted in town Silas what have you therefore the circumstances are favorable enough to see him fielded in mid lane this stretches Beyond roles though you can also factor in play Styles the most famous or depending on who you ask Infamous case study of this is a dear old friend babus AKA the boss ffs and is patented in Ting Scion this version of Scion is still played toppling but instead of going full tank he goes full 8D and instead of grouping with a team as he typically would on Scion he straight up on zadanalay brute forcing his way through Towers until he eventually backdoors the enemy Nexus for starters the build Scion has two abilities with fantastic Ed ratios decimating smash which has a staggering 2.25 total ad ratio at full charge and Unstoppable Onslaught which only has 80 bonus JD but my God that base damage is beautiful one other thing is that his passive glory and death prints in 1.75 attack speed and Deals 10 percent yourself on hit bonus damage the reason minting Zion works is because you can take advantage of science deceptively high damage output especially while dead and since he's already dead anything and everything he does while dead is in that positive room that includes Tower damage building fully D on Scion turns his otherwise benign passive into a terrifying Force to the point where the enemy team is more afraid of you when you're dead instead of alive at the same time they can't just ignore you while in this state unless you're in Towers to shreds this places the enemy team in a very uncomfortable scenario where they want to get away from you as fast as possible after they kill you but they also have to fight you to get rid of your corpse quickly Soul furnace's infinite scaling is also a major contributor to the viability of this soft meta strategy as it allows Scion to continuously scale with or without kills and provided you're good at last hitting the bonus HP accumulation is high enough to somewhat offset all the gold you give to the enemy team from die the absurdity of this strategy both in how degenerate and applicable was prompted Riot to Nerf his pasta to deal less than half damage to Towers mind you in Ting Scion is a very specific Edge case a more simple example of step two would be something like Pantheon support so back when Pantheon got his sweet Geo his kit was unexpectedly proficient down in bot Lane for a multitude of reasons he had a point-and-click dash that gets done for one second a damaging ability that doubled as a long-range poke tool with very high base damage and applied to slow for two and a half seconds and his ultimate was fantastic for roaming till the lanes or heck even ganking his only but would really hit the nail on the head was each his assault his new e where for one and a half seconds he would be immune to any and all damage dealt by hostile units from a Target Direction this included Tower shots when using the empowered version it would extend from 1.5 to 2.5 seconds Pantheon was with no caveat no asterisk the best at Tower diving bot Lane thanks to being able to tank Tower shots for his team at no risk to his own life hence why they found gainful employment as support before they nerfed and reworked him again on the opposite side of the rift as mentioned earlier Top Lane was overrun by Enchanted supports during early 2022. Jonah Karma Sona Soraka rakan Yumi in fact most of the time they weren't even Top Lane at all they just perma-romedal game and only occasionally went up when there was nothing better to do unlike Pantheon support there wasn't really anything within their kits that made them find success up there if anything it was a massive punch in the face to top laners they basically demonstrated how useless the role was by playing an enchanter and roaming all game something that makes no sense would be slippers jungle Renata Renata has barely any wave clear she's super easy to take down when caught her jungle clear speed is non-existent and her passive and ultimate are almost worthless in 1v1 scenarios there is no Rhyme or Reason behind jungle spell push Renata because the circumstances you're putting her in don't make sense that's what it boils down to when you look at everyone in China's videos you have to ask yourself the question does it make sense does the build make sense do the circumstances make sense assassin 5 makes sense she has a very good burst cup of echo's support is not practical but makes sense parallel convergence as one of the longest Thunder versions in the game especially for an AOE ability AP Tom kench makes sense tonglash is a fantastic low cooldown long-range poke tool and his passive W and ultimate have excellent AP Skilling APK that makes sense here is a decent AP ratio and you get ridiculously giant Shields from your ultimate no matter how ridiculous the pick there has to be some degree of logic behind it the more logical it is the more likely it is to be successful are there times where a pig appears to make absolutely no sense at all but still works of course but chances are the player knows something we don't obviously the Grand Master Yona jungle has a very deep understanding of jungle fundamentals to make a champion like your network the Challenger cuts to top probably has an extensive amount of knowledge on top like matchups and threat Windows to make kaisa work leading us to the final step the player's own skill level at the start of the video I brought up how within the meta there are smaller metas depending on the role that's another thing to make note of a rookie mistake everyone makes when trying to follow an off meta strategy is by thinking they can monkey see monkey do sorry to say but if it were that easy everyone would be doing it manychampions on low ELO performs significantly worse the higher up you go given players know how to take them on better dining bold and silver top laners like Dr Mundo mordekaiser and NASA senoric have 52 to 54 win rates whereas in Diamond Plus all of them have below 50. certain of Mana picks are rank agnostic due to their Simplicity critical Loft top merely tweaks the Builder on you still more or less play a lot the same way fully Divi is also easy to pick up you just have to be more selective about when to go in since you can't really punch your way up but for a more multifaceted off-minus Strat like in Ting Scion there's a lot of things you have to be aware of and consider since discording a very fine line between tactical ending and just regular ending while we're talking about that when hinting saying on Nerf his win rate actually went up as players returned to stand a tank sign since the vast majority of vinting Saw and bandwagoners thought they could just die as many times as they wanted and still win that's not how that works likewise certain off meta strategies and low ELO don't work in haiulo you might be able to get away with fully peace inch mid lane and bronze but Challengers are smart enough to take advantage of your squishy melee nature so it's a balance of how smart you are and how ignorant the enemy team is overall the difference between an off meta and troll pick is ambiguous but one thing is for certain there is a higher likelihood of an off meta pick or strategy failing than succeeding which is why they're off meta despite countless stories of players who reach hailo taking a Divergent approach to the game The Meta is there for a reason it's the most efficient and mathematically consistent way to climb if it wasn't the case players wouldn't follow it not gonna lie this was one of the more enjoyable topics I've written in a while I was initially hesitant to make the video because I thought it would be too similar to the previous soft meta video but looking back there's a lot more I can talk about regarding this topic let me know in the comments down below if you found this insightful as well as your own thoughts on what the difference is between off meta and troll pick aside from that if you enjoyed the video I'd appreciate it if you could leave a like And subscribe also consider following me on Twitter at varswam joining my Discord server and don't forget to watch that other off meta video If you haven't yet but for now thanks so much for watching and I'll see you again soon in the next one take care [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you foreign ","11":"what's going on guys this is eggs and in today's video we're going to be revealing the tier list for 13.8 which is updated so this is after all the data has come out for this patch we're going to go through the best Champions the worst Champions and the Champions that have changed because of the changes in 13.8 but guys this updated tier list Pro is going to do nothing made for your improvement play kha'zix play one of these broken Champions you're still gonna be kind of trash well that sounds kind of toxic because I'm probably trash as well at the moment but hey what I'm trying to get at here is that you can learn the game on a level where it doesn't matter what Champion you play in that role you will do well regardless because you know how to play the game positioning spacing bad timing your trading pans counting cooldowns all these fundamentals we can teach you so you are like just innately a challenger player check out the website link down below so you can actually do just that and you won't have to watch these videos anymore I'm such a good endorser for the channel anyway let's get into the tier list guys we will start in the Top Lane the kha'zix isolation tier the most broken champions in the Top Lane for this part match Jack's Riven and we have a new inclusion here this being Poppy the two Buffs that came in especially to the extra damage you get based on that HP has actually been insane for this Champion lots of Champions in the Top Lane as well do have dashes so if we think about popular top laners like Jags you've got Camille poppy does extremely well into these Champions the only Champion she might struggle with is just tank Champions who spell cast so Champions who are unbothered about getting close to a poppy they can play a range but a stats at the moment are just nuts in the Top Lane she's like s plus two and every single ELO so the bus really helps her out now an Esther Champions have actually moved up or down we have Darius moving down to Ester along with Fiora and apart from that just according to Stats without action and awn climb up to Esther from A2 now as far as Loki broken goes with Casio we have gragas kale claired malk I said we will get into these guys in a future video as to why they are low-key broken and why they're underrated at the moment now other Champions who got changed in the Top Lane we have Garen who's in S2 because of the AED buff and bass armor buff these have made him a really good early game Champion now and he's stats have improved as a result of this we also have malphite who got nerfed this patch so as far as your W maxing goes from Rank 2 onwards so two points in your W it is worse than before so this means you're probably just going to be playing a q Max malphite to get the most out of this but malphite is still a very strong champion in fact it's considered in some elos to be the best Champion still so that's why he's only gone down to Ester we also have Lilia If You're Gonna Play her in the Top Lane the Bucks didn't really do anything for her in the Top Lane but she can still do well against Pacific Champions so that's why she still beats him and that's about it guys for the Top Lane just make sure you're not playing anything like Yasuo because of the E changes against strong bruises he just gets absolutely mauled and we also have aurelian soul in the cookie LOL too because of the nurse and yeah you really just want to be playing this Celestial beast in the mid lane right speaking of the mid lane guys let's head there right now so in the kha'zix isolation 2 we have Annie action who I mentioned for Top Lane for some reason axon is just popping off at the moment might have something to do with the close range meta that's what action likes because then he can actually Auto attack Champions who are in range of him we have Cassiopeia who's been a Mainstay for like the entire is season 13 then we have Katarina because of the Buffs now I kind of like undervalued the Buffs here these Buffs especially in high reloads like if you go to like challenge reload let's say she's an S plus two Champion with like a 53 win rate and this is a champion who has lots of Hard counters in the mid lane that's actually why some Champions like maybe lissandra and malzahar aren't Loki broken because Katarina is pretty popular LeBlanc is pretty popular these two Champions listen males completely cut them so that's why they're in low-key broke it but yes any Katarina means let me know how the bus feel in the comment section because I'm pretty sure they are worthy enough to put it in broken tear other champions in the mid lane who you should be interested in guys for this patch well I really install like I mentioned because the HP growth nurse and the armor growth nurse this just makes his mid to late game a little bit worse off but he's still going to be pretty strong that's why he's hovering around it a tip Cosmic Drive getting buffed has seen Champions like Vladimir be really strong which is why Vladimir is an Esther and again the Loki broken Champions we will get into in a future video so make sure you hit the Subscribe button just for that any questions you have about the champions in these tiers let us know in the comments section but yeah like I said not much is really changing just don't play kale in the mid lane because our magic resist is pretty much zero you will get dumpsters most of the time and don't play Teemo as well these two are sponsoring the cookie Lord too now moving into the jungle guys the real kha'zix isolation tier here we go mate so kha'zix is in most broken alongside bellef nidalee and Rengar there are actually some new additions here because Echo Evelyn Fiddlesticks with that j4 here from last patch they've all gone down to S2 so in karthik's isolation we still have Belvedere but then three newcomers kha'zix nidalee Rengar kha'zix and nidalee are here because of the Buffs niddly getting more armor Mesa unkillable for most junglers because most of them will be attack damage based then we have kha'zix because of the base damage buff in your Q This Then means the isolation damage from your Taste Their Fear is Amplified even more this has seen his win rate Skyrocket like two to three percent and that's from the 13.7 changes as well right so layer on top of this and these Buffs he's insane is bug Splat so he's got to be here Rengar is here really just for statistics and same thing with belvith do so well in so many elos and in high reloads they're super op and that's because those players can play these Champions to a t now in Esther we still have some really strong Champions j4 because the nurses drop down a little bit still performing really well actually and we have a bunch of AP junglers here so if you need a bit of magic damage in the jungle we've got a lease everyone Echo for those subscribers a bunch to choose from now as far as low keep broke and go we have poppy here kind of like what we talked about for the Top Lane and then we have zinza just because I think Zinn is a really solid pick but people just don't pick him nearly enough now shadow assassin Kane did get Nerf guys in this patch as far as your Egos and that has seen his win rate drop by quite a bit that's why he's gone from most broken all the way down to 80 but still pickable of course elsewhere in the jungle we have Lily hugot Buffs this is why she's moving up into atir from beta and that's even with the cosmic Drive change which looks really good on paper for Lilia but she's still not maybe like hitting as hard as she might have been in the past just make sure guys if you are playing in the jungle you're not playing something like twitched and said please play them in their stronger roles you're probably just straight up trolling if you're doing so so yeah that's a jungle Tillis again guys any questions about the pigs let us know down Below in the comments section now moving down to the bot Lane here here we go mate for 13.8 the ad carries well the Eddie character list well there have been some changes here we have Draven Jinx and Zaya still in most broken kha'zix isolation tip but we have a newcomer mate look at his head look at the mouth on him this is karthus reason karthus is here guys it's quite simple engage matter parthus is unreal like he absolutely thrives when they're a big team fights the close range team fights it's not like a pokey sustain meta he wants all wins because of his passive he wants all in the close range ones because of his defile and he wants you to get in there so he can land his layaways with a bit more regularity and you guys can check the stacks as well like karthus's win rates in high reloads is close to 55 as an AP carry bot Lane and that's not in like 10 games that's in hundreds of matches if not thousands so here's alongside Raven Jinx and Zaya for the best ball Lane carries now as far as the at-stead Champions go we have Nyla who's still here twitch who's still here in vain and we also have Samira and then Vega these two Champions work amazingly well when it's a close range Miller that's why they're here Samira close range Vega close range Event Horizon GG well played now Loki broke and we have Ezreal now Israel guys is really here because in Challenger career he has a 52 win rate s plus two champion and I will maybe go through some technology under how you can actually play the champion of the highest level in our future low-key broken chance of this video so remember make sure you hit that subscribe button so you do not miss that video MF is here as well because of some like kind of secret Tech that I found so again we will get into that in a future video and Yasuo is here because it's actually just like his better role the E change like I was saying for Top Lane yeah so I was kind of cucked him but in the ball Lane because your win will does so well against lots of AD carries and it's close range at the moment so if you have like a note list next to a blitzcrank of Pike yeah so because your ultimate works well in the bot Lane if not better than his solo land now elsewhere we have kogmore who receives some Buffs in this patch but really there were probably more for like AP kogmore so if you're playing kog'maw mid you're gonna benefit more from those Buffs but one lane kogmore has still improved so if you're going like I don't know lethal Tempo play the Rune King kogmore no worries you're actually better and that's why he's in a tip close range matter as well I still think it actually works well for kogmore especially maybe with like your passive getting buffed so that's why resonator and the stats back this up and that's about it guys for the bowling just yeah make sure you don't pick team as an AP carry bottle in it and you should be chilling now the last role guys to talk about and of course if you are enjoying this content at the moment please make sure to leave a like down below it does help us out a lot so in the kha'zix isolation today guys for supports we have blitzcrank Emilio rakan and setup blitzcrank milio Senna don't really have to talk too much about them right we all know they're broken at the moment and we ever can't even though we go nerfed but the thing is the nurse was so kind of like minuscule they haven't really affected him too much and every single ELO this guy's absolutely killing it so that's why Zuma is broken we also have Janna guys who's made kind of like a little bit of a Skyrocket from aite all the way to Esther because of the bus really to a w as well like this does damage in the laning phase like you notice this it's just a bit of a shame because I'm pretty sure she would be in the most broken tier but the engagement at the moment is really scary for her yes you do counter specific engages like maybe a Leona ride but everyone else you're gonna find trouble against I mean you might do well against rakan as well because you can just stop them with your tornado but yeah you guys get my drift right we also have an Estee in Nautilus pie Tarot thrash these Champions are either engages so hook Champions all disrupters Champions who like disengaging in a way like Tariq in Loki broken we have Shaco because an Engaged meta Shaco loves it mate he loves it when people run into him because you're going to activate his boxes and he can actually fight and bait you into his team and waste your cooldowns on himself against range shampers like a Janna for example it's really annoying for Shaco to play the game now what about other champions in the bond Lane will we have Alistair whose ultimate duration is lasting a little bit longer but he's still going to be the same champion and is the same Champion that's why he's at 80. Leona with the bus still isn't really proving to do like that much more with the w bust so that's why she's still a native and like I said before guys about the Ricard nurse really haven't done anything that's why he is still residing in most broken but yeah guys those were the tailors for 13.8 thank you so much for watching the video I appreciate it this has been easy for the jizz to come whatever you want to call me and uh yeah I'll see you in the next video bye bye bye bye foreign ","12":"welcome back everyone to a brand new update on the best Champions to escape low ELO for season 13. in this video we will be providing you guys with three champions for every single role that are most optimal anywhere from Iron all the way up to Gold but before we get into it be sure to check out skill cap if you want to truly get better at League of Legends we're the only service that offers a money-back guarantee if you don't climb at least five divisions while actively using our service we do this because our service really does work and if it doesn't work for you you shouldn't pay learn more at the end of this video or click the link in the description below One champion that has shot up in power as of recent and is his superb pick for all ELO brackets is orange orn is such a great Champion for the lower ranks for a couple of different reasons first is that orange scales like an absolute monster being able to upgrade his teammates items once he reaches level 14. since low ELO games tend to last longer on average reaching these later levels to upgrade items happens much more often now you may be wondering well isn't orange just a tank how am I supposed to carry with a tank in low ELO sure Oren is a tank but he has the ability to deal as much damage as some assassins with his full combo this is what makes orange so reliable for low ELO because you're durable enough so that making the odd mistake doesn't get punished as hard but you've also got great damage and team fight impact as well the build to run on Oren is a Sunfire rush into jock show second and thornmail or force of nature third grasp is the Keystone Rune with demolished second wind and overgrowth free boots and biscuits are for secondaries another Top Lane Champion with similar strength to Oren and our second selection is malphite malphite is definitely a little bit easier to pick up and see success with right away so if you don't have very much time to be consistent on someone like Oren look the way of malphite much like orn malphite is able to build full tank and remain a legitimate carry threat thanks in part to his abilities scaling off his armor the more armor you buy the more damage your W and E will deal which is amazing it's inevitable you're going to lose Lane every now and then no matter what champ you're playing but by picking someone like malphite who has amazing team fight presence no matter how hard you feed early on there's always a way back into the game you could be laning against an irelia she gets a few kills on you through jungle gangs so you're behind her early on but you reach two items lock her down in team fights and that early lead she got ends up meaning absolutely nothing in the end coming up in patch 13.10 it also looks like you'll now be able to use teleport anywhere on the map at 10 minutes instead of 14 which is going to bode super well for these tank tops to impact bot Lane build for malphite is an iceborn Gauntlet rush into Sunfire each a second and a situational tank item third W Max with grasp works best in those melee Lanes where you will be able to Auto attack on a consistent basis while qmax with comet is going to be the optimal in range matchups or against Champions you cannot reliably trade Autos with to round out the top three for Top Lane we have a bit more of a pure carry being Mundo with hard steel being such a disgusting item on Mundo and with his e damage scaling off his max Health the durability and damage is actually unfair you're able to point and click Auto attack the enemy to death while taking very minimal damage in return which makes Mundo such a consistent low ELO performer there are definitely ways to express your skill on the champion but the skill floor of Mundo is quite low meaning you can pick him up and be impactful almost immediately one thing a lot lot of High ELO Mundo players do that many low ELO players don't is that they run ghost instead of flash ghost heavily outperforms flash stat wise and every single ELO bracket on Mundo but it's only picked in about 15 of low ELO games as a champion who needs to stick right up close on his Target to be effective the movement speed from Ghost is more often than not way more valuable in skirmishes than flashes as for the build it's a heart steel rush and a Sunfire each second and spirit Visage or thornmail third Rune page is grasped with demolish second wind and overgrowth followed by magical Footwear and approach velocity for secondaries moving on to the Jungle top 3 these Champions who have reliable lockdown are very consistent for the lower ranks and first up is VI oftentimes games in solo queue and especially in the lower ranks just comes down to which team finds a catch play First on someone who's out of position with Vai having the engage range of Q Flash and R she is one of the best Champions at capitalizing on these positional errors it's also much less likely for you to mess up ganks Post 6 when playing a champion like by thanks to her point-and-click ultimate Skirmish team fight dueling power if I can do a little bit of everything which makes her a great champ to make if you're looking to climb low ELO now the build for Vi can vary depending on preference and what team comps are looking like bruiservai is going to be the cookie cutter build you can't go wrong with regardless of the game if the enemy comp is super squishy however then going lethality by is viable as well but does leave you with less margin for error due to its lack of durability if you're just picking up VI we definitely recommend starting with Bruiser and then once you get the hangover start implementing The lethality build for the Rune page take Halo blades with Sudden Impact eyeball collection and Relentless Hunter Triumph and alacrity are the best secondaries next up for our second jungle selection we have Nocturne we like Nocturne a lot for similar reasons to buy as you have incredibly strong catch power and a very easy win condition to play towards each game farming through six and looking to make an impact through alt place is a very simple game plan to execute on consistently whenever ultimate is available playing towards whichever teammates provide you the best gank setup will ensure the highest chance of securing kills for example even though ganking bot would be preferred in most cases if your Bot Lane is playing something like Soraka or Janna who provide very poor setup it may not be the best investment of your time if your top laner is playing malphite or orn who have incredible CC power playing towards them will give you a better chance at securing kills and getting ahead standard core build for Nocturne is a stride breaker rush into Black Cleaver second and death's dance third lethal Tempo is the Keystone Rune with Triumph alacrity and coup de gras grab eyeball collection and ultimate Hunter for secondaries our first two jungle recommendations were both ad Fighters so if you want to add an AP jungler to your champion pool as well amumu is a phenomenal option Buffs in 13.9 have led to a moomoo's win rate absolutely skyrocketing way more than most people would have expected including our analysts it's sitting at around 54 right now for the lower rank so if you're looking for some free elo amumu is the pick to spam w got buffed from 12 all the way up to 20 damage per tick at rank 1 which for a spell that he maxes out last is absolutely incredible the added DPS this change provides throughout an extended fight is insanely big and is the reason his win rate has seen such a spike build for amumu is a demonic Embrace rush into jock show second and Sunfire Aegis third the Rune page is conqueror with Triumph tenacity and Last Stand followed by cheap shot and ultimate Hunter for secondaries there's really no better mid laner for the lower ranks than Ireland Soul if you just want that quick and easy ELO reworked aurelian Soul has been dumbed down so much that he's very simple to play at an effective level raelian scales like a monster but has a bit of a weaker early game which makes him way more viable for low ELO than High ELO in High ELO alien is a much more difficult time succeeding due to players being able to more consistently punish his weaker Lane this simply doesn't happen as often in low ELO and if you allow aurelian to reach a couple of items he's going to single-handedly take over games the build for aurelian soul is a rod of age is Russian to ryla's second and archangel's third comet is the Keystone Rune with Mana flow Transcendence and Gathering storm roll with free boots and Minion dematerializer for secondaries another mid lane champ who takes very little skill in order to be extremely effective on is malzahar males is consistently a 53 win rate champ for the lower ranks because he is a beast on three items and hard counters all the melee dive Champs low ELO players like to spam come team fights males is quite similar to aurelian in the sense that his pre-6 is where he can be exploited the most with Mal's your main goal through the first a couple of levels is to acquire as much Farm as possible while keeping the wave on your side of the lane you don't want to be spam pushing with W early on Mouse especially against mobile melee Champs because you're way too vulnerable get to that lost chapter by and then you can start hard-pushing waves and looking for plays around the map with your jungler the build for Mal's is a leandries Russian to rylai's Second and demonic Embrace Third Run Arie for the Keystone Rune with manaflow Transcendence and Scorch optimal secondaries are magical Footwear and Cosmic Insight let's be real here a best champs for low ELO video would not be complete without any making an appearance sure the champion may not be the most flashy or fun to play but if your main goal is to rank up an escape low ELO she's going to give you a much greater chance in a shorter amount of time you can play any champion in the game and eventually Escape low ELO with dedication but with how low of a skill floor Annie has she makes everything so much easier even if you just have Annie in your champion pool to hard counter some of the most annoying Champs you see in low ELO that's a great idea Annie always performs amazing against Yasuo Katarina and yone so pulling her out to nullify those Champs works wonders the build for Annie is is a luton's rush into Shadow flame second and zanya's or ramadan's third run electrocute with cheap shot eyeball collection and Relentless Hunter for primary runes best secondary page is manaflow and absolute Focus running down our top three adcs to climb low ELO the fastest starting us off will be sivir playing adc's in the lower ranks that can find ways to be impactful other than dealing damage is going to make things way easier for you sivir is a perfect low ELO ADC for a few core reasons the first is that her incredible wave clear from W and Q allows for you to stall out games way longer than any other ADC if your team is behind early on there's always a legitimate way to hang on and scale if you're playing sivir throws happen all the time in the lower ranks and often what will happen is the enemy team will become extremely impatient with you clearing every single wave try to dive you give up shutdowns and the game is suddenly flipped in your favor sivir's ultimate is amazing as well because you have access to a tool that provides your team with power without needing to deal any damage at all if you're not doing so out but your teammates are picking up the slack silver R does a great job at enabling your teammates to thrive core build for sivir is a crack and Slayer rush into navori quick blade second and phantom dancer third for runes grabbed lethal Tempo with presence of Mind bloodline and coup de gras followed by free boots and biscuits for secondaries there's always one ADC that you simply can never go wrong with for the lower ranks and that champ is Misfortune MF is one of the few adcs that requires very minimal mechanical skill to play at a serviceable level your main goal in every team fight with Misfortune should be to stick in the back line and be ready for that opportunity to throw down your R when your teammates engage the range on Misfortune R allows you to stay at a relatively safe distance yet still unload a mass amount of DPS oftentimes you won't even need to Auto attack with MF and you'll still come out of fights being way more impactful than the enemy ADC core build from his fortune is a kraken Slayer rush into bloodthirster second and infinity edge third grab press the attack for the Keystone Rune with presence of Mind bloodline and coup de gras free boots and biscuits are for secondaries 180c was an extremely powerful pick no matter the ELO bracket right now is jinx the Nerfs in 13.9 accomplished very little in actually weakening jinx's power level as she's still an amazing pick Jinx is even better for low ELO because if you can reach three items there are few adcs who have better team fight impact since games tend to last quite a bit longer in low ELO reaching that Infinity Edge Spike will have you demolishing everyone in sight the versatility of jinx is super nice as well you should can be played with melee or enchanter supports to great success flame Chompers give her exceptional follow-up on melee supports engage plays and offer strong chain CC power in Lane enchanter supports may not have the same amount of kill threat early on but a jinx being buffed up by Emilio or Lulu in team fights is a very scary Champion core build for Jinx is a crack and Slayer rush into phantom dancer second and infinity edge third lethal Tempo is the Keystone Rune with presence of Mind bloodline and coup de gras optimal secondaries are absolute focus and Gathering storm kicking off the top three for support is going to be a pure carry pick being zeref what makes zereth such a strong champ for low ELO is his ability to thrive against many of the highly picked low ELO supports Lux Senna and Morgana are constantly the most big supports in low ELO and with zaret's heavy range Advantage he can shut down what those supports want to do sure zareth may be more mechanically demanding than most supports but by applying this simple rule it's really not that bad brush control is key when playing a skill shot Reliant support like zareth as throwing skill shots from the fog of War makes him way harder for the enemy to dodge due to how long long-range their stabilities are you can camp out in the close brush to your Tower instead of the middle brush and still find angles to poke the enemy down as long as you're throwing your skill shots when the enemy ADC is going for last hits they really aren't difficult to land especially when using them from fog build for xeroth is a luton's rush into Horizon Focus second and Shadow flame third for the Rune page its first strike with free boots biscuits and Cosmic Insight followed by Mana flow and Scorch for secondaries if you want to carry support who doesn't require as much mechanical skill to pull off then look into maiming Heimerdinger Heimer is a very unique support because he's able to set up many plays that most other supports can only dream of push power is exceptionally strong so you can shove the enemy ADC under Tower and drastically limit the amount of farm they're able to secure low ELO adcs are going to have a much more difficult time securing Farm under turret so you can amass a huge Advantage by using your shove power your macro play can really shine on a champ like Heimer because of his incredible objective taking power Heimer turrets allow him to melt dragon and Baron and you'll find yourself in positions to sneak into early Baron almost every single game nobody in low ELO expects a 20 minute Baron so if you can acquire Vision top side prior to the objective spawning pinging your team and looking to sneak it is an easy way to accelerate leads playing with a Duo partner who plays a champion with strong DPS power is a great way to ensure this strategy works every single game as well the build for Heimer is a rylies rush and Julie Andrews second and zanya's third Rune page consists of comet for the Keystone with manaflow absolute focus and Scorch best secondaries are magical Footwear and biscuits and for our third and final support recommendation it's yet again another Mage carry champ being Zyra simply put you cannot rely on your ADC to be a consistent damage threat in order to win you should go into every single game hoping for the best but being prepared for the worst if your ADC has no clue what they're doing and you're playing an enchanter or a melee engage champ you're more limited in ways to carry the game by playing a support like Zyra though your ADC really doesn't have to do anything for you to make an impact level 6 especially look to camp out in the side lane brush and if the enemy ADC pushes up alone it's free pickings with your full combo The Zone from Zyra R and plants make her a very powerful Champion around objectives try and secure Vision well before objectives spawn camp out in the fog of war and poke away at the enemy team while they try to walk in the build you should run on Zyra is a leandries Russian to realize second and zanya's third comet is the Keystone Rune with manaflow Transcendence and Scorch followed by taste of blood and Relentless Hunter for secondaries alright guys before we wrap this up let's tell you a little more about skill caps so we offer a five division rank up guarantee and think that's a

watching good luck with your rain climbs and we will catch you back soon ","13":null,"14":"hey the berries welcome to another EP support off meta game and I'm playing thrash I have Relic Shield but something is a Miss I have dark Harvest and we're going to be doing an AP thresh well look you're doing an ed thresh at some point in the future but today we are specializing in AP yes AP and we're going up against double poke so that might be a bit problematic but we'll see how it goes as always these games are done buy a normal draft and you can join the Discord dot GG slash bizzleberry if you want a chance at playing with me on these viewer games where I just goof around and uh try and have some fun while trying to find something that actually might work in games uh so up against double poke Caitlyn heal and exhaust on the karma and uh yeah thresh can be pretty tough time against um those double kind of Pokey harassey Champions uh we're gonna lose a lot of HP I might take a recall before we actually get things going and it's going to be difficult to pick up Souls which is going to give us AP which is what our main source of like looking for that extra damage but we will be going AP uh in terms of actual items itemizations um I haven't fully decided exactly what we're going into just yet and kind of kind of go on a whim about it but I'm thinking something like a illudions uh could be quite good otherwise something like an event horizon could be quite good too I don't know I keep calling Event Horizon that's the name of um vegan stun but they are the item where it does like 10 damage or we can do Shadow flame we can pick up a shadow flame I think at some point in this game as well I think that would work too this is what I was trying to avoid just getting hit by a magic here so we're gonna try and get level 2 prior here so if I were doing an okay job I just need to kill one more melee minion here okay that's a flash from the Caitlyn also a flash from me but a flash from the Caitlyn so maybe we can get something off of her it's like Nunu is ganking mid right now against an UDA that's kind of overextended right now just looking like a good gank trying to see if you can find an Avenue to land a hook not really it's just a couple too many minions don't want to get poked down I mentioned at the start like this yeah I don't want to get poked down like this but I am at least able to pick up more stores than I thought it would be able to that's not yeah not clean poke there from the Gin hopefully it doesn't get hit too much get another Soul which means more EP IC Force more armor but we're after that EP since we are going an AP thrash now thresh actually has some pretty good EP ratios so he's got a 0.9 AP ratio on his Q uh his ulti also has a pretty insane AP ratio as well of a 1.0 making those walls do a lot of extra damage uh other AP ratios we do have a 0.7 on his Flay as well and the actual active part of the play um so we actually have some really nice AP ratios the downside is though is that doing some of those abilities will put us in a potential a bad spot okay Karma's missed out okay it's a shame that the route didn't land from genoves that would have been an easy hook onto the karma but then her movement speeding away that kind of made their situation a little bit more good than I would like to so I thought maybe I could catch out the kitten but she could have just caliber netted away if she wanted to it was kind of a desperate hook but I think we went straight out on a TV2 on the actual field I think we are kind of waiting for resets really or a gank it's quite a difficult Lane to win to be too into early on especially with a Karma she does fall off dramatically as the game goes on but we don't want to give them a lead same with Caitlyn as well she's pretty she's not that bad late but she is primarily like a leaning phase Champion so I'm not expecting us to pop off Laney phase we're kind of waiting until we hit into that mid game I think so in order to really show the potential power of an AP Thresh yeah I mean they are overextending a lot it's a shame that we haven't actually got a gank coming down here but even though these are viewers um then they're not giving me the special treatment which is good I think it ends up being a little bit more realistic that way jungle is never ganking your lane it's very ranked queue uh experience isn't it anything grabbing first but it's quite a late first spot of five minutes into the game and finding it very difficult to find that hook comma oh no it was a bit of cheeky damage there that wasn't that bad Caitlyn's starting to go low on terms of Mana getting hit by those in such a pain we're definitely gonna need a reset at some point might actually just have to start asking you need to just appear down here so we can no no no no he's having to put that shield down there that's very too spooky got Flash coming off again soon Canon hasn't got that flash but that's just rough it's a shame that Nunu is doing Crocs instead of rolling down into the lane um this might be too late it's too late I mean the interrupts that recall which is quite nice but yeah it's just a little bit too late skinny Thresh I mean we could probably do something here I know but the new news not gone away okay that just about worked Caitlyn actually hasn't got any more resources left what's that hook damage wait what were the dark Harvest that was hilarious what they only started coming back down again once again just a little bit late okay I wasn't quite exciting at hook damage okay let's pick up these Souls because I want the xjp so I'm just think like I don't know like a death cap scaling with this extra AP passive would be really really nice um let's of course go sock shoes and then honestly in terms of Mythic items these mythic items are not uh good recommendations essent night Harvester and maybe we could do night hops or a hex tech Proto belt or of course let's do that that's gonna Gap clothes as well let's do it hex tech Proto belt Thresh okay I love it I love the sound of that okay not overly familiar with using the item though but I love the sound of it so it's nice to manage to get a kill for the Gin I got a kill for myself we're all a little bit behind in CS unfortunately AP ratios do not oh I'm not going to get that kind of minimum I never did the gin oh that's happening at Dragon I wasn't even paying attention needs to be a bit careful about how it's a shame that binding didn't land there otherwise could have maybe got some nice damage to calm oh into my ulti into my walk into my old walk into my old no okay at least we've got one solo no minions snowball okay the drift is good okay oh did Caitlyn try and Flash over the newness Noble I think she did didn't she I think what happened there was Caitlin broke a wall and then Karma was able to use that to to escape through otherwise I would have got the kill for that but the person three dark Carver Stacks our Hook is currently doing 282 magic damage it's quite a good chunk and then obviously you know that's going to go uh up to 300 on base and it's only going to get higher and higher and higher as we accumulate more AP and muscles all damage should be looking pretty high here as well 341 damage per wall but don't forget though Champions can only take damage from one wall but you know five Champions take damage from each wall That's 1.5 K damage this is where the um Karma will start falling off now she's just used that Mantra Q into that brush I'm just gonna Ward over the wall here I don't want to get caught out by kha'zix solid Ward Karma's being very very very aggressive Mike Mike Hook is one shot in cast of minions my ulti is about to come before down nice okay that's a good W from Jen in the auto attack with the dark Harvest fantastic let's begin to put more points than ie a bit tricky to hope not impossible here oh I was hoping the Gin would hit the melee mini in the front of me it would be that would have worked so then hooked the Caitlin Okay so we've got karzek's coming down here he wants a taste of my hook all right we can go back and get a blasting one or gin wants to stay we can stay I don't mind staying it's a bit greedy about it man I think the common there's some in this brush okay that's fine oh sh oh she didn't get hurt let's say this caveman has ulti I need to be really careful Caitlyn oh surely I don't have my w I think I can block a Caitlyn ulti no maybe I don't know should I have ulti oh she would have been dragged into turret and like a flayed no that was a nice key from her though that's a shame thank you all right we've got all the components leading up to hextec were 171 AP already 400 damage on the hook and get another 50 damage putting another point in we're doing all right like I want to say any face would be a lot harder I mean Caitlyn's still on four kills um but yeah I thought this would be a little bit harder in terms of the linear phase just because of how brutal um well we did lose first time they must have actually got a lot of plates as well so that we didn't add that into the equation so yeah they're actually doing quite well on part right now it's going to change this new focus on the dragon especially when we got a new new just a little bit of I think maybe the Moon is a little bit paranoid about maybe helping me too much um but your new noodle likes playing Bots side generally quite a lot because of the um the dragons the nunu's really good at taking dragons we really need to do the track in my dude it's taking way too long it's 15 minutes into the game let's just find it I don't know just to do the stuff my guy I don't know where the noon is going we should just honestly just forced to fight out here it sucks depending that there to block I'm gonna interrupt the car sex they got it though how is I think I'm gonna die to this kha'zix okay I'm not sure how they end up getting that when we've got a Smite and a new new q and it's super unlucky that that happened then um the shame Seraph wasn't able to come down for the fight there as well just a little just a little bit of lack of team play happening I might need to round up the berries and see if we can get them to uh yeah but hopefully we can start playing for the next one on the plus side of the fact that there's been no dragons being done so it's not probably going to be a dragon soul threat for the enemy team to take I can nearly get my protocol I don't want to stay in this Lane for too long sure where karma is but they're uh okay karma is down here over the track oh you kidding me I need help please and that dark harvested proc comment this getaway some nice movement there from the Caitlyn I'm surprised the Gin gets to stay alive I wasn't able to land a hook there that was a lot of extra movement speed coming up there right I might need to try and play around the Seraph then nice tariff all to hit oh oh comment oh Sarah can wave clear that that's good and Sarah's doing quite a lot of damage so maybe we can get something from that oh why you can't like buffer the E when you're doing the hex tech Dash I press the buffer and then the flay didn't come through kind of awkward getting a little bit unlucky here look at the core down on Rock about it's actually pretty low it's kind of onto the dark Harvest stack it's Karma's being very pretty uh kha'zix is right here decent hook that's uh the carsexy's really low HP nice we got a Kill this next bit of the fight might be quite difficult Landing a hook there onto the karma Proto belting flaying away extra damage this Caitlyn's getting quite low wait my Hulk killed Caitlyn but it I I thought the Udi was gonna block that it was right in front of me I'm super surprised that I managed to kill the kale in there with my hook that was an invisible hook and a half noon what are you doing uh next item I think we just kind of have to go into death cap and utilize the passive AP scalings that we've got here I think we can get to some really high AP numbers 503 damage with the hook there plus with the dark Harvest need 15 golds oh yeah why is magized I think the thing Noodle's having a trying to have a fun time on there maybe the Seraph can peel out of the dynamic oh I I could have Lantern saved that's actually on me 500 damage hook that Tower is going down we can't defend it like that oh wow okay and no one's chasing I was considering flash trying a flash hook there but it's okay enemy teams at the second dragon um who's my wife oh man I gotta be honest to Canada and kind of look like in exciting things swears hmm sauce need to get rid of or we can do some damn we walked through my wall he doesn't know my wall there's a billion damage hook oh the whole team is on their way back over here ah no because minions being able to take the turret there but the new news balls rolling come on yes are we able to do can we do the baron at all is this possible probably not it's that way we can do Baron our damage and that's going to be way too bad 355 AP ricot double the ap of my mid laner just because of the crazy AP scanning as well from the uh the thresh is passive oh hextech protocol gives magic penetration as well that's really nice like on the extra items as well and we aren't going to have that much magic resistance on their team I don't think so I should have quite a lot of value every single EP give give give give give I mean even though we're going for AP I've still got 113 uh armor just imagine resist and maybe a little bit of hell for lacking on can we help out the Garen here at all probably not okay definitely not please just click the Phantom dude oh okay Seraph can you um so screwed foreign just a complete disaster snowball will catch out kha'zix right oh we got juked oh okay still kind of overextending and potentially disrespecting here okay I mean we gotta fight for this dragon we have to go for this dragon nice hook she has to stay in there oh no my house okay I'm gonna have to recall and then come back into it these guys are just gonna have to not in right I can maybe land a hook from downtown a downtown hooked the Gnar it's looking promising a little bit of a shield there for our whole team please don't die no no yeah she took the lantern what a legend I don't quite have enough for a death camp but we'll have it real soon once we have the death cap by ep's actually going to cut quite high and then we can do wardstone on top of that oh nice that gave us we've got bounties um yes if I'm allowed to take a couple of these minions shoes that's quite enough need to kind of do a little bit of Ward clearing and then recall that's fine got enough for death cap 370 AP to 500 on the DOT Hook is doing 750 damage Flay is doing 585 my OT is doing 900 per wall just gotta hit stuff now I would love to press Q on that again but I do not want to die if the man fly it after that I don't like that gin's positioning at all I gave him a lantern but I've got a nice wall there nice suck again on UDA huge oh my goodness this new killer launch General zarifault combo is massive we don't have a jungler so doing the uh objective couldn't end up being a little bit tricky oh nice that hook and the damage on the hook nearly at 100 Souls now we're at 100 Souls 510 AP what was it that I was gonna buy there was an item I was gonna buy and I've completely forgot on what it was I know I wanted a shadow Flame at some point but I feel like there was oh award Stone because it will give me even more AP scaling because Woodstone has is a 15 something like that some 12 ability power extra which combines works with the death cap as well so we've got a lot of extra like every sole is going to be worth like basically 1.5 EP per Soul or something like that maybe higher than that that's a really nice catch from the Garen what are you doing my dude all right can we do Baron no no no we need you alive about hooker damage okay can we do Byron someone might need to defend against uh the base is a Caden alive I don't know if she'll go for this or not though please don't die Nunu whatever you do all right at least we've got Baron I was right that you knew it was gonna mess up somehow all right we've got Vigilant wood stain fishing at waterstones giving us 52 AP death cap is giving us 152 AP around 639 EP sorry 644 AP on Thresh Hook is doing 879 damage Flay is doing 686. OT is doing 1044 damage per segment of wall no yeah there's a little weird buffer window oh no Karma's gonna walk into the wall or she was considering it don't die no ah that Karma just got nuked with the dark Harvest Park as well which is also doing 233 give me all the souls okay we evade they're the tanky members on the team are becoming a little bit of a problem uh I managed to hook the kha'zix but my health is going down now you don't have gin alive any oh my God that damage he's dead good please please yeah is this my jazz even had any stacks we will never know um what do we want to go into we're starting to build some magic resist now so we're gonna go into void stuff got a uh a vessel mask on the U there Nars picking up some magic resist too there are some 22 challenges of Magi is actually that's pretty impressive really needs a death cap though he's going into Shadow Fame I think that is but he needs a death camp he's already got a void star so they are that's not gonna give him as much as he probably would want it to serif now is on off serif even though he's got 22 stacks of Magis I've got more EP than him 604 [Music] isn't that crazy hurts where are you going I don't know where he's going someone needs to cover but I think the newly might have been a bit intoxicated I'm not really sure what's going on the coronation maybe drank a few too many um maybe just kinda need to let zarift do some of the work here but once again his damage is just a little bit lower than what I would like it to be I feel like we have a real chance to this game just need to find the right moments the pushing down mid defending nothing right now okay this could work it's a shame that one missed I could have maybe have got a hook onto the comma after that slowed if that were to slow I don't want to fight that car 61v1 no oh they're around four Tower Defense right now does mean I get some more souls so it's not the end of the world for me but we're all down to inhibs just looking kind of Bleak and Nunu is dead again yeah I definitely think he played the drinking coronation game take a sip every time God is mentioned down one if it's God Save the King I still probably feeling the after effects of that maybe I should have probably picked up some controls actually they've got full control over the dragon and the baron we can't let them have Baron uh the dragon sorry they're gonna go straight from Dragon here though uh Baron to Dragon they're getting a baron and they're gonna take dragon and we have to defend that we can't let them have hex textile otherwise it's definitely going to be Juju oh they're just going straight for the dragon they don't care about Baron I got my wall down no Garen used ultion Karma no no he doesn't have it for UDA here which could be really really important they're bailing is it because kha'zix is nearby or something oh yeah they're gonna get a hex tech Soul here then I think that's gonna be the end like we kind of need to wait for zeref to get a death cap now at this point and that it's gonna be too long she has a shame I think a death car part Biff into the shadow Flame we'll see what we can do maybe we can accumulate all the souls in the world so I better hold off this Baron as well 138 Souls 650 AP well 176 armor considering I haven't even invested in any armor or any tank items this game is kind of insane 3.2 K HP so you can get away of not actually having any tank items on thrash so yeah I mean we're having to defend oh Karma goes down here we pop off the ga of the car sticks but I don't think we're gonna get anything else over that says an UDA under the turret we need the Garen to kind of move up if possible no no it's gonna be GG but I got some really funny hooks though it's just a shame we got kind of run over it was a nice attempt Chichi let's have a look at the damage at the end of the game double Nexus explosion what do we have here we have drum roll we have 29k damage on Thresh we actually did more damage on everyone apart from the Zara if he did actually manage to top the damage maintaining that Magi Stacks up really really high but now did a surprising amount of damage and we had a lot of health and armor considering it didn't biasing with tank height and so I was super surprised that I will probably investigate that more but I hope you guys enjoy the game um might have to find a new new after that one a more sober Nunu but if you guys enjoy the game I hope you guys enjoyed the Offman stuff I'll be doing more of the stuff on the channel and um yeah take care stay safe and see you for another game soon bye okay ","15":null,"16":null,"17":"all right guys they're playing some Shen Top Lane in the new patch and I'm gonna showcase you guys exactly on how you can carry with Shen so this gamer playing is the pantheon um what we have is grasp Shield bash bump plating Revitalize then we also have cheap shot and then we also have ultimate Hunter now this matchup is absolutely crucial to have Dorn Shield because it's like a Perma poking matchup it's not going to be an easy matchup at all yeah like depending on the matchup you want to like adapt your starter like some matchups actually allows you to go long sword slash D blade where other matchups like Pantheon match up it's just way too valuable you know having a d Shield is dramatically improves the laning phase this is exactly one of those matchups so now there is a couple things I wanted to think about usually when you play Shen you want to play it very aggressive a lot of matchups are highly favored for you um this matchup however is very different Pantheon is like one of the Champions that beats early game it's specifically what he's designed for he needs to win early game slash roam to make the champ work um we on the other hand we have something that Pantheon does not have um we have the ability to like set up the lane for gangs like very easily with my e and then we also have my ultimate for rotating as well so what we're gonna do is I'm gonna play around my strengths here we're just gonna play the setup um we're gonna make it as gankable as possible and play around a big wave because there are big waves we can actually win the trades but when the the wave is like too big for Pantheon um I won't be able to trade him there's no way I'll just be avoiding his trades for now don't be too scared to like hit your Q guys when you play Shen uh oh I missed that one whoops when you play Shen and you're gonna go for the last hit and you think you're about to get poked make sure you actually cast in your Shield um that way you can block the damage most of the time any any person that sees you last hit they will try and poke you when it's like a a champ like Pantheon so keep that in mind we're gonna take the um we're gonna take the wave to stack up here so we're gonna Auto it a couple times I want the wave to be as big as possible um so once Pantheon walks in he won't be able to fight me that's what we're aiming for we also have a Zach like pathing Top Lane pretty good now we've got to be very careful oh I messed up my w a little bit this should be very good I'm going to cast my potion here because we have a Zach Patrick top side and the wave is currently shoving into this guy I think he's got no warts either very good trade very good trade and we already got him by myself cool I probably didn't even have to flash but just to be sure I would actually land it I certainly don't mind using it nice now we need to find out a way to shove the lane out um we're just going to be pretty tough to do I will have to admit because we do not have a lot of wave clear and Pantheon will make it will get back top soon I do not have the ability to push this in so we have I'm just pinging up here because Zach is ready I think we can probably catch Pantheon on his way back well does he have passive no yeah he does have passive he could jump in I should just jump in to be honest with you you should try let's do it give it a chance if I Dash in I'm gonna die right now ah this is not this network it's working okay GG wow I don't really know what to say here I need some help here to I need Zach to shove this out otherwise I'm gonna be in trouble oh I appreciate the push oh the dream jungle listens to my pink to push it out I like that so much nice I needed that one sometimes guys you need to shove the lane in you need your jungler to help if your jungler does not help you in this case I would actually start losing Lane again so sometimes you just have to Ping your genre guys there's no other way around it sometimes you just need your jungler like these are one of these uh these moments where you just need him I I could let the wave bounce into me but it's way better if I just take that wave along with my jungle and then shove that in it's just way better only thing I wish for is you know letting my jungle do that faster but I'm quite happy still did it so hey thank you for the resub thank you for the three months resub welcome back lemur so now we have my ultimate available which means the uh Lane is now Gonna Change up a little bit we also have a sweet little Vantage for you'll notice um there is a thing with pressing alt on Shen that you have to know do not press R when the wave is not in your favor um I'm gonna showcase you what I'm Fitness so if I were to press R right now I would actually start losing Lane because I would lose all the last hits and panting can do whatever he wants with the wave and it's going to be like out of my favor right if I had TP it would be different but we don't have that right now so what we're gonna do is we are not pressing My ultimate We're Gonna Keep My ultimate right now um because if I were to use my ultimate right now I just throw away my entire Lane face this is where most Shen players go wrong because most champ players they press R whenever needed but that's not how you play Shen that's a very bad way of playing Shen you need to have like um you need to know exactly what you're doing um with the macro play before you old always know what you're doing beforehand make like a tiny little plant otherwise you're gonna mess up so you see like we're not pressing R I'm focusing on the lane here I do not want my Lane to go bad we have a twitch path in top side and I got my e back soon I think I might get a kill here I think that's which it's not very interested could eat him yep guys I think we can actually beat him right here especially with twitch why is that already cool so now he's there pretty good so a lot of Shame players will go wrong here just saying beforehand uh we had a lot of fights in Berlin I could have teleported I could have used my ultimate but we're not doing it because I do not want to give in my Lane face here um same thing with twitch like twitch was going for the herald I refuse I absolutely refuse and now we press r [Music] so this this is how you play with the Shen ultimate specifically right here we Shuff middling I mean Top Lane we shot Top Lane the wave gets under tower now we're not losing anything we're not losing the wave we're not losing plates we're not losing anything plus we're alting down mid lane we're getting a catch because I'm halting mid lane and then we also get a kill or an assist for it without losing anything we haven't lost a single thing in fact we made mid lane win even harder this way this is how you use Shen ultimate you want to use it in an aggressive way you want to alt at the time when you're not going to lose anything because like that's the most optimal way of using the ultimate so yeah it's sort of like you're using teleport um before you know when it when you could teleport anywhere in the past you know sort of like the same strategy always using it aggressively oh we stack the wave up again we got hard Steel there you go hey lemur hand thank you also for sending a sub GIF man I appreciate that thank you so much man always amazing when you guys like stop gifting also telegram thank you for the reset two months man I'll get into your message in a second thank you for the reason we gotta be careful about jungle here I'm gonna try and hit proc but I do not want to jump directly into a Pantheon um space of water donors hey thank you to map for the soft Prime lots of sub primes this game by the way literally my first game today I want to hit my proc he's expecting me to jump in I'm sure of it wait a second I got twitch like walking top sign I'm not gonna dive because there's literally no reason for to do that I think we can dive him because his W isn't cool down ah it's flashing away okay smart guy oh crap [Music] well I got no passive yet but that's okay I got my ultimate now right before I mean right after they die it's me the timing was really bad anyway we shove then we get back the next item we're gonna buy is going to be the Titanic Hydra or it's uh okay you can go in I'm gonna let him take that wave we're gonna head back yeah let's go buy me Cinder so again like this is not the most optimal ultimate as you could see because we did push into Lane butts um as we approached bottling with my ultimate we are actually now losing plates so it's not really worth it if you ask me here but um again it's not that bad because uh they also did not get any plates so it's not that bad it's uh it's okay hmm Andy's dead cool now I started taking the wave so you see like Shen is more than just what you guys think right this is the reason why Shen is rated as in like an S tier champion because you can play Lane out you have all abilities needed to like play the layout and then on top of that you have your ultimate witch constantly allows you to make plays across the map so you're sort of like playing like two roles at the same time it's just that a lot of people they don't know how to play Shen because what people think is that you just gotta hit r as soon as your team is about to die but that's not how Shen works Shen is more complicated than people think but if you know how it works it's uh pretty op like you need to be really good at like uh uh at like the macro part of this game then the better you get like macro wise uh the better the champion also becomes good trades they can't really fight me I got my passive oh I underestimate this guys uh it's damaged right now gotta get a reset done okay I got my ultimate available you press R because otherwise this guy dies I'll get an assist included at least I hope I will nice and now we reset immediately getting a proc as well plates are gone right now so painting is not getting any pla any plays anymore which means that this this rotation is very good Press On doing an ultimate like that is acceptable if your opponent you know can no longer get the plates because it's way different at that point as for the message hello Dave nice to see you again thanks for all the YouTube videos keep it up man hey thank you man thank you for that message and the resub got you I think he flashed I'm not sure it looked like he flashed because I flashed I think he also flashed but I'm not sure anymore I think I did all right so your turret has been destroyed after the tower we'll try and get the wave but I think there might be a rotation of the enemy team possibly I need to be a little careful here because they could be rotating uh yeah there's the Ultima I think I can probably get a really good jump off well we can keep autoing like this sure all right and stuff a lot of people don't expect the damage from Shen the the thing is like we don't really have like if you would look at the build it looks like we don't have any damage but the thing is like everything does damage like that's the funny part it's not what people think um well forward uh he didn't work for it okay let's go back here so yeah like a lot of people don't intimately think about this but every item you buy in Chen does damage in some way or another um for instance uh when you build heart steel the heart steel does damage because you proc it it does damage Sunfire is another just one of those tank items you would think it does no damage but uh Sunfire does a lot of damage actually um unsurprising a lot like it's it's uh way more than you think um there's two items when you build a door Mill thormill also does damage so you have like three tank items that actually do damage so you think about that for a second like all these items You're Building those damage and hearts like then you have Titanic Hydra uh I mean not the 10 gaija I mean um yeah Titanic um which also does damage so yeah I have my available but yeah every item you buy enchant is damaged Titanic Hydro does also damage as well lots of damage in fact I don't think it's gonna walk up well one proc basically kills this guy I definitely cannot catch him but I'll stay close to him so he doesn't get to reset I got my ultimate N20 thankfully though I didn't get ganked by the enemy jungle this game at all like not even one gank yet Shen is not really a champion that people want to gank either like wow I did not expect else gonna work to be honest with you yeah well it would have been very surprising if I'll say that one I got my ultimate available right now let's see if we can make a play with it twitch's mid carefully I need to get dormal next but I also need to get a Titanic Hydra I think I want to get Titanic Hydra for the for pushing just makes it easier uh gets damage as well which is always useful there's a fight on Drake I'm focusing on the map here seeing what's gonna happen because a fight's about to break out if he walks closer I'm gonna take it for him okay again an aggressive play you see what we're doing here we're always playing the Shen ultimate in an aggressive way I'm never I never use my ultimate in a defensive way if I see a fight being bad I am not gonna press my r i will not because then I will die as well always use Shen ultimate aggressively never never when you whenever when there's a potential risk you're gonna die along with it there's no reason to do it or like when you're like losing waves or something like that it's just not worth it oh he's about to die he will never live there you go no matter what he did there he would die so let's take like another wave here we got 1.8 k M so I go okay so time to get back now we have a choice to make do we go thornmill or do we go Titanic Hydra now I think it's personally a lot better to go Titanic Hydra and the simple reason for that it's really simple when you look at their team their half ad have AP if I were to go for a thermal right now I would only counter Tristana and I would only counter Pantheon everybody else is AP at least AP this guy's AP this guy's AP so if I build thormill what am I building it for right it's still a very solid item because I'm still countering the ADC with it but um they have such a mixed like team with everything that it's better for me right now as it currently stands to go Titanic Hydra because then I get a week clear uh damage and I get more HP as well to thank everybody so it's got more play for it it's got a lot more play if they wear like full ad however so let's say like a yaso mid yone top or something like that I don't know if you're top or even top I don't know like any Champion really like having a classic joke or something like that then it's more a lot better to go thornmail because you're literally counting five people with it so oh yeah there it is I could see which one the real one was because of the hard steel proc it's very easy to tell let's go after this one I think I can catch her she does not have teleport oh that's the real one you can just see which like it's funny because the heart steel proc literally tells you what the real one is because that one will proc first before the other one does so I can always tell which one of the real one is okay I do not have to press R because they're already catching them and nobody's dying so I'm staying here I need to run from this one because I got Sunfire and Sunfire does damage on Pantheon under a tower which means I'm gonna take Tower damage I'm using my w very late because he used the ability there's no reason for me to press it sooner my teammates are getting better which is very good nice good catch I am not gonna go for a play until I see where everybody is now I can go for it shut up don't go well you walk away sure now twitch can still go for the play I just don't think he knows it yep and I got my passive ready I got twitch uh I got twitch here too but ah I suppose I could try and bait nah never mind he doesn't have to go for a Pantheon there's no reason let's go Brembo they don't really have much healing but they have some so it's still it's still worth buying uh Drake is spawning in 45 so I'm gonna be passing Top Lane yeah what can I say right I tried saving it with my ultimate because if I were to walk into that I could actually kill all of them with my team because they were all prepared but this guy died so quickly that my ultimate just didn't even work so yeah there's not much you can do about it we have to Lane pushed in here which is pretty good uh this will be a very good catch I need my team to be ready here I don't think they are I don't know should have used it sooner I I wanted to get in the position I should use it sooner whatever wow okay allow me to explain situation here this is so stupid I was in I was in place I was ready I was completely ready to make the play happen but then twitch and Zach they went bot Lane to try and get one catch so we were basically left out in this really good position here with my 80 carry and then we both die for it that was actually very very sad because that was going to be such a good play actually but they these guys prioritize bowling yeah bad play by them I managed to get out but apparently Zach doesn't do any damage at all which is surprising immediately oh wait dies oh man we got the catch it's not that bad after all set off my ultimate two nice walk forward okay good catch there's a Pantheon right on our back here uh we shouldn't be going for the chase on Pantheon that's not worth it quit the tower I think we can uh they shouldn't be doing this man like that's bad you're gonna die I'm just gonna leave him such a bad play man like it was super mega predictable that Tristana was spawning I don't think he paid attention to the respawn timer it's such a basic mistake that a lot of people make like you you take it and you take an objective but people just somehow want to go in further for no reason like there's nothing on the line of whether you kill them or not like it doesn't change anything always keep in mind guys when you take an objective whether it's Drake Baron Tower inhib like whatever it is like don't overextend because it's like the number one reason people lose games oh standing is the worst thing you can do just buy items come back strong refresh your mind right after taking the objective right crap I need to get back in top but also ball Lane I actually want to get back in Top Lane but if they get that catch it's gonna be a good one well it looks like they're not going to catch I got my ultimate available if needed I'm balling here got my ultimate available but yeah it can tank a lot of damage from this guy yeah there you go I think that the game is pretty much done from here because we just killed pretty much everybody They're All Dead for like 20 seconds yep the game's done they're still spawning like five seconds for Pantheon nice hey this is Shen toppling thanks so much for watching today's YouTube video and I'll see you next time peace ","18":"or I guess they're playing a riff and Top Lane against a Tryndamere and Tryndamere is a very very old matchup and it's a matchup I haven't seen in a while in a very long time actually I'm going to Showcase you guys exactly on how you can beat a trinity beer today so um in short we have the conquer page as always we got nimscope Transcendence we also have two adaptive you can also run a cool down flat in the bonus stats to make the matchup easier however in my opinion you don't really uh you don't really have to get that yeah so we're going to start off with the Shelf here well shove just going to go with like a slow push the way how you beat your enemy at level one is super simple you fight him when he doesn't have any rage the lower rage he has the much more likely you're going to win it for one If he if he builds up the full rage it's going to be impossible to fight him so do not give him a chance to get the rage and we already got him nice he went for a fight level one um against my team lost like 200 hp for that went for like multiple all Lanes immediately as soon as I get level two I win for the all-in and he did not expect B to uh to get my w that quickly so we're starting off pretty well here I like where it's at I think I will go for the wave though all right let's take that Cannon as well yep I did not get it we're walking away from that one gotta be careful about Lilia right now did I deserve a second chance I wonder if he's gonna jump in because I use my shield I hope he does but I don't think he will can now that's a point where I gotta be careful because Lilia can now gank the lane there you go always pay close attention to the wave guys whenever you see a Nico in the jungle the chance of being ganked from the lane is very likely because the Nico can just change into a uh creep right now and then gank you so keep that in mind okay there's no Nico here because I like the way how you counter Nico is you count the wave you count how many La you count how many creeps are walking up towards you if it's more than so stupid to play against ah that lands that's unfortunate my jungle can uh oh he should have tried killing him he didn't have anything he could have killed him for sure man it looks it looks so ridiculous when aniko is walking up to you like a jungle Camp it looks so stupid then it's so ridiculous to see I don't know man ah ah they both get away okay well whatever we're gonna be stacking away for very slowly we have no intentions of resetting um I just want the wave to be as big as possible there you go I want the wave to be as big as possible and then as soon as the crashes on our Tower I either want to go for a fight or I want to go for a full reset so I can buy the next item and have like an item advantage let's see which it's going to do here I need like one more wave to get myself level six whoops oh I missed my combo that combo right there was actually very very crucial to hitting because now I don't think I'm going to be able to kill him maybe I can try it out [Music] I still managed to get him thankfully I was level six he was level five he his Dash was some cooldown so it's like an instant opportunity for me to try and get the kill don't be too scared to dive a Tryndamere guys if his ultimason cooldown tournament is actually pretty weak so yeah if Tryndamere is level five just go for the dive if the wave is stacked in your favor just do it let's go now um now you guys might probably think why not eclipse why Gore Drinker it's a trendemeer Well the more HP you have in this matchup along with damage the easier time you're gonna have because if you make a mistake or you go for the all-in you can actually tank up a lot of autos and then you won't risk like dying um because of it shouldn't be chasing you down so so especially when tournament expressing are you want to be able to survive from it now we start stacking the wave and there you go that's the ultimate and then I get outplayed anyway feels bad man because my w was like half a second and my uh my flash was also half a second so I should have just been alive here I had two two things coming up which could have saved me here but half a second like this is sad man but it's okay whatever I don't think it's going to directly impact my Lane too much because the next time that I walk back to Lane um The Wave is like tank like it's like um building up and once I walk in Lane I think I can probably go for the dive because tournament ultimate is down and the ghost is also down he used all some spells um to make that work so there you go you see Dave I go for some plates we're gonna start maxing e afterwards this is so stupid then I don't know she can that's new to me she can transform into this plant thing what else can she transfer into I did not see that one before my Hunger is my penance hmm okay well we have a genre up here too let's quickly get that Arisa okay so let's take a look generous ultimate is available so it's now going to be easy for my team but we'll we'll see what happens we'll clean it up whoever gets low we'll try and kill it I have my ultimate uh in 20 seconds fortunately I can't one versus three I'm gonna have to get a rise up here oh I'm still in a one versus three and I bet you they can see me or they can't actually see me nope I purposely waited for my combo to press R and Q at the same time and shouldn't be did not expect it so you just have to burst during the mirror like that's how you counter him now we've got Tower and yep he still has r ude The Flash oh really that knocks up as well wait that's something I don't remember really so the ultimate knocks people right now I did not re I don't is that like part of the rework I don't remember Nico like knocking up people that must be new huh that's sad okay no problem we'll uh we'll play it's no problem for me it's okay it's all right the Perma Camp is quite real here but um fortunately like despite the Perma camper doing absolutely fine check if we can actually fix mid real quick oh well it's a barrier fellow cause really Ico beta bro okay I got baited so hard right there unbelievable shut down well tough match permanent Camp has been quite annoying we've been managing but now we're running mid lane and that also fails whatever we still got the game but it's slightly harder right now because we're on the same page section we're both level level nine Andy's got my plates hello hey thank you for the subprime coonan got my whole Tower things going quite smooth hard match so far but we'll figure it out a way I think Trin is still up here got that one yeah I think they don't know because they don't react yep they did not react tonight there's a fight on Drake so I'm gonna position myself here so they can walks this direction Santa is on base and Tryndamere is Top Lane so this is a uh the steam fight is a win right here they're gonna catch tonkan sure always pay close attention to how the you know if the fight's gonna go we take that one too because children is pushing Top Lane we're trying to be efficient here and I'm placing a ward specifically here because I think tryndamir is going to try stealing red buff and I want to be ready for it when it happens so so far we've been out farming chain completely so we are making a lead right now your cracks are showing let's get one more wave and then we can safely back and get my item we got the level lead back like we're lucky enough lovely level 10. so the way how we've been playing currently has been making a pretty solid comeback for me ah and then I get ganked Again by Nico bro I keep dying by this Nico I keep dying by it I got very close I don't think my ultimate hit I should have killed Nico right there like I had enough damage I find it funny they could like twice the amount of damage and like then Trend should I only did 800 damage I'm surprised that like uh like the the fact that we got perma-camped like this hard in the game and we're actually still having a lead against Tryndamere I'm glad that we do man especially now with Hydra we're not going to lose our lead anymore stained glass shut this out same way like before I'm Gonna Keep drawing attention from the enemy jungle hopefully this time we can kill him oh yeah we got him this time this is the real one [Music] [Applause] thankfully time to pass back Top Lane again tournament does not polish at all we have like constant pressure on China mirror all the time foreign nice like this is like uh the most important thing when when you're getting Perma cam so much if you can't keep like constant pressure um it's okay you know like you can still rotate you can still take jungle camps you can still like outperform the the trend [Music] Nico is so annoying man like this guy is super annoying perfect Champion honestly for ganking everything like it works as you can see but like despite the Perma camper still performing super well foreign on me and we also did this Camp here to Xbox in 30. so now we have an item that will help me against uh Nico and Falco specifically and also the tone catch by the way because he's building like lots of AP ril so three champions tournament is pushing Top Lane let me check real quick here because I think that my teammates already have dragon so I think I'm not bothered because uh chunamir is heart pushing yeah I'm glad I'm running top side because my team already has the Dragon let's go if I am guilty of anything let's get that next wave enemy killing spree all my teammates have died well I'm not gonna go back I will stay around because I rather get the I rather like give them the towers and stuff I'd rather let like keep give them the towers and stuff and then get like a tower myself then I got him [Music] uh two of them are mid lane so this guy's alone foreign I have my Ultima oh whoops oh yeah the knockoff I gotcha I I knew it man I knew this guy was gonna do it I don't know I I was thinking I was I was literally thinking like what would Nico do like and then I saw her using the W I just knew it I don't know and like people trying to outplay you like all the time one way or another let's go back well we were carrying we're carrying this game Let's uh it's got four let's get a 4.3 cave we can get a death sentence and then like final items you're just going out of Warhammer I I think I'm gonna go for a garage for purpose though so maybe spear Georgian Drake will spawn in one minute 30. all these planes [Applause] well they're fighting mid sure I'm uh I'm balling I'm balling I mean I'm Top Lane chilling sure are you kidding man actually worked the ash Arrow oh man what a play ER [Music] my blade there's going to be such a good play I was gonna Dash back in bro I have my Gorge anchor available first I could jump back in all right I got my item man that was going to be such a good play Man okay no problem I'm full build we're chilling 18 kills we're gonna do the same thing all over again [Applause] okay let's go all we need right now is a baron and bottom and hip I think I'm just gonna run straight to mid lane to be honest yeah let the fun begin s hmm oh well we can make a play thank you I'm walking away from that one nope and did you hey this is uh River Top Lane for getting permicant thanks so much for watching today's event and I'll see you next time peace ","19":"foreign oh my God alrighty guys for today's video we are going to be testing out the brand new static shiv Tech on the PBE so in case you missed it not only is static shift back but it now has a 50 AP ratio on the chain lightning meaning if we have a thousand AP we do 500 damage to every single person in a team fight and we can proc it multiple times that's about as much as our ultimate it is just so much damage oh it's one minion right there uh it is so much damage that I am so excited to test this out we've already done a few games of it and the it is crazy so hope you guys are ready uh the runes we're rocking are conquer presence of Mind tenacity Last Stand and we are also going for sun impact and Ultra honor gonna be playing a little bit aggro on this one I missed it okay I'm still gonna just make a Miss XP I think that was a really good idea from us I'm gonna keep him here they can all right does he hit level two I don't think he has hit two yet I think he's missed so much experience nice I'm a big fan of that play right there even though I didn't hit any abilities we just denied him so much experience nice and that is actual damage one little Combo level two does about six percent of their health so yeah we're going for a Sudden Impact and uh ultimate Hunter very aggressive setup on the runes but I think against a Katarina it's not a hard matchup um in the Laney phase so we don't really need the second wind or the bone plating and it's not an aggressive jungler so we don't really need to stay full health and uh be extra defensive all right I think we can kill her no we can't eat a little bit can't sweep that um we run okay I wanted to get a double but that is not a problem I think we need to push this wave and get out of here you can help me push that next wave that'd be amazing okay I love it amumu is a great Champion for this all right I love you so much we appreciate you okay nevermind I kind of just denied me off a lot of minions but you know what it's all good we are happy to get the wave crashed in with the kill so far so good I'm gonna drop a word right here I'm gonna be curious if um amumu goes the enemy of Mumu goes for there uh goes for the top jungle I want to see where the enemy jungler's at yeah we're on the PBE testing out a bunch of mid-season item changes uh rapidons now gives five percent more AP no strings attached doesn't cost anymore it still builds the same so that's amazing on top of that static shiv is back we've got Kraken Slayer is no longer a Mythic item rageblade is a Mythic that's completely broken prowler's isn't a Mythic doesn't even have an active anymore so many things but I made a bunch of videos on those if you guys can check it out on my second Channel or even on this channel my main Channel if you want to see all the cool things they've done lots of fun new builds off bad stuff I was kind of banking on hitting my e right there I thought I could bait her but she moved a little bit slow I thought she'd go for a dagger but that's okay um we actually can kill no pass the prox can expire I need that damage to kill her it's a good hit but make her e out nice wanted to not have that available not gonna get anything here am I okay we're just testing see if we can chunk her out if we don't get anything it's okay we have nothing we're not really risking anything because this is a very one-sided Lane when I'm six and she's five uh even when you know she hit six I still have so much more damage than her so we can go in for these little pokes and see if they land or not Without Really any negative downside yeah literally any poke we can do is good just a little bit more opportunity to do this and kill her and give her a chance to run until my old hits her perfectly so I don't overextend into the turret too much and I should have to take both of these right come on don't do me ah there we go almost that did me dirty or if I miss a cannon I die on the inside all right perfect let's get out of here so for the full build we're gonna be going for Rocket bounce sork boots we might go Shadow Flame maybe not we're gonna go rabidon's void staff uh we're gonna go shiv probably on the second or third item we just want to get some AP first made okay RP I should have probably cleared that word out but either way it doesn't actually make a difference we were gonna recall she was gonna take it either way okay all right let's keep going in aggressive towards this Katarina I'd imagine yeah she goes for that barely hit her with the e that's good didn't even take a tower shot so really threading the needle on this one but whenever players play so safe under their turret you gotta make it happen right we do have Tier Two Boots and she only has tier one so if he gets anywhere near us we can close the gap on her that was a good Flashfire I don't have time to wait around for her to flash okay when was level six I would imagine he goes around here surely he's not gonna run into me yep we're fine that was a good timing for her to flash there I know this character plays a collie too yeah she's not gonna recall there all right Battle of the mummies new Indiana Jones sequel um okay well Canada definitely recalls now so just kidding JK JK uh she's still here well she's dead then and that's a Mumu is like waiting for me even then I'm gonna trade one for one what's my bounty stop that that actually did enough to kill me huh I've been unfortunate I really did not think it would moombus damage always kind of surprises me at six but I guess it's only fair because he's not really a champion until then uh rip wave that is okay yeah at least they're all about to be uh back up we have ignite but now I'm really just looking to spam my w and get back into Lane as fast as possible because it might be the difference between one extra experience off of a minion or like yeah which will lead into leveling up in the middle of a fight you never know is he gonna do it he is gonna do it okay I'm so glad we envisioned on that that is a fairy tale completely hold on hold on hold on don't make it obvious we gotta get this kill all right well unfortunately uh amumu made it completely obvious that they're doing it thank you there we go amazing oh okay ah no balls on cat I genuinely think I made a horrible Mistake by not uh by not running away from her I'm sure she had her Ulta but I I think that would have been an easy triple kill for her but maybe she didn't know my cooldowns were down and maybe she didn't know that like pretty much our team has nothing it's fair enough they Pike exhausted definitely would have been uh not so good for cat uh oh oh thank God yeah she's not gonna get me oh just kidding please leave me alone oh my God she didn't even pick up her dagger I'm fine let's go oh my God dude everyone has gotten really annoying ever since he hit ever since he level six dude actually though No One's Gonna all right it's fine I had two people I thought they were gonna cover oh geez you are Mumu versus the mumu she tells you not to worry about all right oh thank you for the push all right let's get out of here X Tech rocket belt has been acquired I think we go straight into the ship now we've got enough AP ially if we can stack it up into or stack up our dark seal and maybe get a magi's I mean then we'll have plenty of AP it's just getting this 80 item first isn't as useful because you know you need the AP to make the chain lightning scale and like do damage it's good without any like if you rush it but it's just way better if you get it like third or in this case second not really worried I mean cat actually no they're moving might have old still honestly I shouldn't have used W there unfortunately cat has another E every time she picks up her dagger so I can't really just old combo her like I wanted to I was about to just press R and then e okay these minions are not behaving and uh cat is definitely bought if I had ignite or stopwatch either one I think we could have finished that but without either it would have been bad my pink cat is bought I'm sure she's bought or recalled by now but she definitely was looking for Bob in which case we just get a free turret because she is wasting time that is how you counter a roaming champion please I don't want to die oh my God all right nice try Noobs not even close though unlucky unlucky unlucky let's get out of here Jesus all right awkward amount of gold just not enough for the magi's and you just not enough for the new quiver million flashes later I know alt e alt rocket belt e five dashes without even flashing away you gotta love it okay okay all right we had a ward okay he doesn't have all down so that's good I have nothing to worry about here against cat I think if she is again I'm just gonna one shot her God damn it dude this is a it's just getting old this is getting very old knuckle eye oh my God I once again have the most awkward amount of gold known to humankind I am selling this and getting a magized I don't think it's Drake not Drake that's out of combat I mean I'm just a fast champion I was thinking about it as I was playing against akali a few days ago Champions really busted isn't she like she has so much health Mobility damage wave clear invisibility like I don't know it just seems kind of crazy oh god oh okay we're fine we're fine run what she thought he thought I was going that way we have seriously boots we're fine we're fine we're fine we're finer findings no way you can catch up please remember Dodge this I think this we just we just secured 100 gold for running let's go oh my God you know what I'm here for it give me an assist give me an assist who guys don't look at explosions perfect oh my God oh cat did the war jump or the dagger wall jump oh my God these the mobility in this game is Just unhinged I'm here cat you wanted me right hello no it's not over yet don't ever say it's over if I'm breathing who died how the hell did we gotta shut down oh that's fine oh we don't have enough for shift still never lucky man never lucky your team has destroyed all right Pantheon's a bit of a problem the thing about Katarina is she's so hilariously flippy floppy I don't even know how to word it but she can be one in five but rest assured one good team fight for her and she'll tend to kill you very uh it's not like Mastery I think Mastery doesn't have enough Mobility and like has to just jump in uh Katarina can also get a Zone you know it's just a bit different that is a bit better at pen to killing while zero and ten even though she's like only halfway there all right so far so good Let's see we do 240 damage 234 damage to each champion and then minions do double so 470 that's amazing hits nine targets look at this we did it she's Chung laughs [Laughter] I had to do it foreign get lost I love that combo oh I don't like any of this to be honest I think we run I think I like this at all I like this though do I like it no I don't I don't I don't I really don't what am I doing man why did I do that I literally knew it was a bad idea and I rock it belted out to abort but unfortunately I was already over the wall now we were talking about that Katarina team fight that that good cat or anything you fight well thank you all right good I think Caitlyn got it that's okay Caitlyn gets it knocked into the world pint got my bounty as well he's he's the filthy support he was one in four he shut down our gold reset it's all good but do they get surely they don't get fair in here I'm not even gonna check it because yeah I don't think they have the damage um between them and cat doesn't do damage to it Pike doesn't do damage to it let's go here let's go get this dragon I'll take this really quick it's a little bit greedy it's very greedy actually but all right we have the healing now I love it we're going ham on this boom got it 500 magic damage because of shiv uh let's get dragon and then hold that we're gonna lose the Tower of your dragon I got some Stacks to match eyes that's good I guess not really sure it's somewhere in the middle of good and decent wasn't bad gonna keep running around get our ship to keep rocking ah let's see what happens oh my oh my God run run run no I can't help you why are you going that way bro we have no cooldowns we just used everything run run run run run run okay we're fine we're fine we're fine we're much faster than I'm gonna create the wave we just one shot the entire wave oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] at least we're invisible [\u00a0__\u00a0] oh oh oh my God oh my God dude no way he just saved himself for me oh my God okay okay okay what that missed oh man okay I just need 100 gold please okay okay that was amazing that was a certified star walking moment I am actually so in love with this build too all right so we do 300 bonus magic damage loving it I think cats lost it a little bit going off the deep end all right I know you just saved me and I love you but I also I just need this blue you can take that all right we're doing it I don't know about this to be honest I don't think I'm the biggest fan of this play but I mean isn't Pantheon just gonna ult on top of us how did my emiss I'm pretty sure I just directly threw it on him um okay we're not in sight okay I was like to say you know what it's Caitlyn you enjoy charging up the adults I'm gonna land it directly on you in one shot you oh gosh One Shot The Wave I love it oh wait is this it's time for the shift to activate come here wave I know Caitlyn's there I need you to spawn right now all right it didn't work good try let's get a rapid or let's get a needless at least for now foreign need red the red buff is just so nice that's the stain it's just so under appreciated 500 damage 300 goodbye Tower yeah luckily cat seems to be choking a bit I'm dead I'm actually alive I'm fine barely that's so sad I thought I was gonna live with like two HP damn yeah she altered she altered right when I started my R1 so I just unfortunately jumped through all of it probably not the move but it was just good time about her okay now doing 322 damage with our static shiv nice opponent sandwich Champion season 2000 with it so far oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] even with rocket Belgium we've actually done more with shiv than Rockefeller and we bought [\u00a0__\u00a0] or Rockwell first I think that's pretty safe to say it's a good item on akali I mean the crit's not good the attack speed's not the best but I mean fifty percent is a pretty giant number I'm curious to see if it sticks around like well into uh mid-season like main patch coming out all right Katarina today you bleed for Ionia ah goodbye damn it well I don't do damage yikes I needed that stun to come out after my zone has ended and I would have been completely fine unfortunately I don't think Pantheon really or Jack actually thought that through that's all good though I think vain just gets a pen to kill nice machine gun tech damn that sucks I wish Jax would have saved me but as it is what it is all right let's go yeah Pantheon's a bit of a problem he genuinely just took out 75 of my health in one w ow but I guess that's what we get for playing glass candid right okay is activated wait for that to expire then be backwards um gale force on Caitlyn so she's got two dashes plus a flash Katrina has about a thousand Pike has one I think I'm gonna go for Pike probably an award right no he's not okay I think he ordered like right outside their base all right we have level 16. foreign still uh let's go back and damn Caitlyn traps I want to get rabbitons and Baron and then end off of that I mean van can one shot when she's up as well all right we have 17 seconds without Pantheon being live I might just send it on a 1v4 before Pantheon has a chance to ruin everything okay that was bad that was really bad damn they didn't do any damage please help me I really don't want to die uh I guess there's not much you could have done all right let's sell this we'll have enough for rabbitons and then avoid staff for all of their Mr because they have a lot even cat what Merck dreads okay surely Academy is not going towards that nice yeah I mean if Pantheon blows his entire load the blathering king is empowered W Auto on the MooMoo I think he's just he's gonna have a really bad time they're so close I'm Gonna Save a few seconds all right we fly back into Lane I don't think they're gonna need me for Baron I mean Pantheon's dead bane just one shots this thing yeah all right doubles and we're good to go all right I'm just having a bit of fun I'm gonna let them spawn and then I'm gonna kill him we do ocean soul really quick too yeah let's do ocean and we'll win the game here let's look at a blue pot I don't think we're gonna get our last item all right a little bit of AP then and we're happy with it how much does this do 400 bonus magic damage so far match if we had infernal dragons we didn't even get a single one the only one we're not getting all right foreign attend this game once and for all do it I could do it Pike just go bro you almost for nothing I was so hype then you just stood there that was weird I am 900 damage to proc my oh no let me get some poke off take the enemy team nice we're just range folking them though on the next minion wave oh bro they're really just focusing me I mean there's a lot more people you could go for you know I used to do damage to them so I can proc my ocean drag holy crap all right so this game is actually not over damn yeah they just destroyed us cat's gonna do a lot now freak yeah that build is nuts we have to we have to like just kill her and silly yeah we just need to counter out the Katarina ultimate the moo moo and she's not allowed to do any damage this game okay we go top and mid I mean if they go for this I think yeah just just fight them we'll be there to say please go in actually fight them very strange to be honest um this is good we want them to commit they haven't reset yet yeah we nearly just one shot with an auto cue all right who else is going to show up here what she just does a lot of damage now I guess okay I'm gonna have to be a little bit more careful on how I one shot her because she is glass Cannon hmm vacuum okay yeah a few minion autos all right Baron's up in a minute okay okay nice I'm gonna move saves a little for cat made it a lot more difficult we are officially in slightly worried mode this is never gonna work all right one more we are sitting up now it's all fun and games until they suddenly instant kill all five of us out of nowhere down like 10 kills 20 kills all right all group yeah I should probably keep farming just to get my void staff as fast as possible really just one shot every minion uh 850 damage almost damn creating pressure got the baron one shot cat no we missed cat all right if I hit cat I was gonna one shot her we have zone is available too you need to unload our E2 R1 ignite I think we one shot her all right but now we can go for the end to be honest going in that direction as they carry cat's still alive ugh definitely kill here good oh my God here altered a Pantheon it's tragic all right we need Elder we almost won that even with vayne kind of just running into the enemy team and ending hmm you just have to fight um there we go that's how you play cult oh God oh my God that's how you do it man that's how you do it dude 100 200 pink amazing okay vaulted wait don't end let's give him a chance I want to see oh shave applies that as well whoa I just want to see how much damage I can do we have Elder that might be it no he's healing a lot huh wow wait our Auto just did about 700 damage on a minion we added a minion and then that's crazy hold on hold on oh God insane when we can that's it we can but this is so much fun playing with elder [Music] goodbye world okay it's sad to finally end I think we've dilly-dollied wait wait too much but oh my God 466 match damage that seems so it does a bit more oh it's because we have the base damage as well static [\u00a0__\u00a0] so it has a 170 at level 8 or 18 plus if we had a thousand W so it could do up to like 670 or 700 damage plus it applies your magic abilities like Elder there's gotta be some funky builds for this that we can test out yeah stupid Pantheon dude makes this game pretty pretty unfortunate we can't do our 1v9 plays and then Caitlyn also just uh her trap makes it so zones is a kind of worthless item you know what let's see what happens we'll call lichpane okay 388 plus uh 470. what even is this build thank you my God I wish I was mid right there the two squishies were alone I'm assuming we get MooMoo flanked into a Pantheon oh my God our Auto just did 1700 damage oh GG it was worth it in the end that was so much fun damn Sonic shave is such a fun item I don't know if it's gonna be like built-in ranked or like using Pro play but it is certainly so much fun I hope you guys enjoyed the video it was a bit of a long one but um please be sure to leave a like subscribe if you're new check out my other channel Prof akali we post it daily on that channel as well have a great day guys peace out ","20":"hey everyone so Taylor here again and today we're bringing you deep now a lot of people are a little bit unhappy with the state of deep and I can understand why a lot of these games with deep feel very lopsided you either just crush them or they Crush you before you can go deep or you get an awkward hand I think Sunny said it best I we have a game against him in today's video and I went to a street stream afterwards and he said it best it was like a non-game because you just sometimes deep just have these games that are just non-games where you either just face roll or you don't but regardless it's a very strong deck in the matter right now and it's performing really well in the stats so I figure it's time to show it to you all again after my last video two months ago so hope you enjoyed this deep gameplay if you do make sure to like the video below and subscribe to us we post LOL videos every single day enjoy the games and I'll see you at the end of the video where we do a more in-depth breakdown and Mulligan tips enjoy in this match working against Karma set if they keep double karma in their hand I think they have a you know good good uh good head in the shoulders I guess um I like the undergrowth I like to see scare up I definitely definitely wonder the undergraph is nice if the opponent has like a acorn here right it allows me to at least kill the acorn and not let the opponent get two cards so it's a good chance that one of those at least one of those is karma I was debating if keeping the Vengeance was correct by the way right so I was debating if keeping the benches was correct by the way even if I have the one drop I don't think I actually play it at one time I think again I want to deal with I want to be able to deal with an acorn here right so even if the even if we had the one drop I don't think it was actually correct player so I understand the opponent going for the emo but again we wasn't going to do anything there undergrowth those are all really good cards I'm gonna just pass the damage to their face doesn't matter the damage to the face doesn't really matter okay Garrison I'm waiting for this C scare app before I put him down you're gonna have Mystic now like I wanted to use removal on this stuff first you have another car here that they haven't shown me that we know that that's going to be a spell as well right so uh I think I think now we completely see scare up right just get ourselves one more ahead but when it has to kill his sister first with an Aftershock otherwise we get to go a little bit a little bit faster to a deep yeah this day after shot like we talked about I'm gonna play these show Hunters because unit's time is actually good for us loosen all these jettison's are gonna slow it's gonna slow down my uh like unfortunately I lost all three garrisons so it's gonna be very unlikely for us to be able to actually level a map guy just do audio removal my friend I know you have that I know you have it all I mean this is fine that's a four minute plastic wrap everything cool we are so far away from Deep our hand is not ideal for us to go deep with it's not like I can play this mauka like this because it goes to a head spliterator and we don't have any units to just drop down to go like if we gotta go in deep faster it would have been better but like again losing those jettison's we saw all three garrisons it's a big deal it stops our maokai from being able to level quickly and also stops us from going being able to go deep quickly right you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna go devour here because I have nothing better to do and if the opponent tries to stop this devour then we can just undergrowth afterwards right to still kill their clocking so it's just like a Tempo Devourer so that we just have a unit in the field for later when we go deep like no lure of the devs no jettison's it's rough out here unless the opponent has like double but even if you have a double mistake the underground still kills it and the more removal they are using here on this units the last number we'll have for later um on this I mean you saw me this card the double jettison right you saw me this kind of double gadison so you should know so hear me out we just saw the opponent played double Aftershock right so I think this is safe I think this abyssalai is actually safe because the chances of opponent having a way to remove this are gonna be lower and I actually really value the draw here like this draw is huge double undergo technically gets me there huh it's so Harvest and not really doing much right I guess we can use one of them right now might as well use one right now because they're not they're not gonna kill anything else right this is not a matchup where the soul Harvest really does anything [Music] the problem is that Karma right Karma turn is about to come and we don't have America leveled up so we don't even get to shop like to cut their Deck Down of Buenos Dias enough enough here to get okay well I'm just gonna there's one problem if I play this Terror and the opponent has said they can kill the terror what if we just go Nautilus why did we just go Nautilus if the opponent wants to go set I think I found with that I need I need a salvage yeah this this is gonna be a set yeah there you go we knew we knew that was coming I need a salvage right opponent gets to kill one of these guys they're gonna go down to two Health gives me a great Target for the uh for this underground we're gonna pull Nautilus that's that's really that's is that really your best pool the man is glitched by the way the opponent only has three Mana I did not keep it I guess maybe they're not keeping track of my daddy Sons yeah just just just pull there that makes the most sense yeah yeah yeah uh six we have 9 11 right so we can go six oh no we don't have enough for both on the girl and the battle we needed 12. I'm okay with your opponent putting this down to 2 Hp because we can go the undergrowth undergrowth so another unit that buys dust okay if I can go deep okay so this will go down to five this will go down to one uh sorry this will go down to uh three right now this will go down to four because we're going to two that's gonna be six Mana we have five more to play with that gives me access to the undergrowth and the dead draggers let's start like this let's start like this and force the answer out of them a punish you always recall this Nautilus if they can by the way this is such an awkward game because we got this guy a little bit too late this gets me down to 16. unless the opponent literally commits the deny right here and then we have a second undergrowth to follow up with opponent doesn't have any coins okay they could still get the set though they could get the set level up here so that was six so if that if you have another setska spell they can actually get the set ah they are the showstopper and actually save their set right if they can spend the sixth Mana they can actually save their set but if that's the case I think we just go maokai into dredgers lucky they kill this Nautilus I think we just come out into dredgers but obviously they want to level up set they get one coin back that means that they get to replay this set but if they replay the said I just go devour I think this is this is fine right I think this is fine I'll let them replay the set and get the get the showstopper so now it's even worse I mean now like you have to show stopper now I mean how are you gonna deal with this not unless you have to play you have to go for the showstopper now right do we ever pass here [Music] do we ever pass here the opponent passes back again that's kind of crazy let's go Terror let's get the free value obviously opponent has a recall or a stun right one or the other so they always have a wrinkle or stun if the opponent plays the set right here they can they actually don't have to worry about the uh the uh the devour anymore no but they're not they wouldn't have yeah they need one more turn right so they have this done okay so they have this done that's cute this is seven plus nine it's gonna be 18 plus two no and I can't count seven plus nine sixteen and then plus two is eighteen but playing this devouring now is probably not the correct play yeah playing this the battery now is definitely not the correct play but when I just have enough for this set so this is just gonna be a nine damage push because you can be a nine damage push um and then I guess we'll have to just go and try to threaten the karma right we don't have a vengeance so we're gonna have to just threaten the karma with the devour yeah we have to just threaten the karma here with the devour the opponent has enough to play their the little thing right let's go here just at this point we're just gonna develop as many big units as we can before this Nautilus disappears because the chances are that it's not just gonna disappear you're gonna get your whole draw take all your whole turn whatever do your thing the punish back to 13 Mana by the way so they can play the set but they still need to deal with this devour if they have a Mystic shot we can technically still go on the grill because the Mystic shot gets me to buy three so we can undergrowth and that should be enough to actually kill it so let's say that their opponent goes for like double Mystic or double high note we can undergo oh okay I I don't mind that because he's taking the opponent one more action to actually play that Karma again so they have to replay that Karma gives me the chance to draw us and potentially draw another devour okay they get the show stopper though so I only have one I only have one time I only have one turn to be able to build to be able to just Place something cheap with our Nautilus foreign to play something cheap with Nautilus this is costing me yeah so we're gonna go here just get rid of the set opponent can play the karma but the karma is now the game Ender right if they have a second set that's how I'll get punished but how are they gonna deal with these big units because they cannot play they cannot play Karma I mean I guess they could play Karma and they just whack for them to play Karma they should play the show stopper first this is nice because we can actually play the mega if they tap out of karma I think I'm chilling yeah no way right you need another car now they go up to five they go to four Mana with this you do you really not have the Mystic I think we're going I think we win obviously the opponent gets to kill the the Nautilus but then we just attack with this board and we're chilling uh you wanna excuse me excuse me okay I guess I got another free sea monster why do you have a fearsome blocker they can only get up at four Mana and they already played double of the four drop they already played for double of the smooth midsologists so I don't think they have anything else that they can play here it's not this Market is leveled up by the way so the moment of the opponent place a second Karma we could drop down the maokai and as long as the opponent doesn't have a second set in their hand I think we actually get there they're staring down at crazy board here because they can't play Karma to have like a lot of value so I understand what they did it though they wanted to have the show stopper but it just wasn't enough against our deep units I can't believe we're actually about to survive do you have a three cars okay they have the pit professionals so they have two blockers they have two blockers so if they actually if they actually have at least one stunner a RICO they can actually stop this because they ended up with double blockers we can go like this and then play the maokai they block the fear some here and then you use it to have something to do with this two guys so why not that's done nope doesn't even have the stun all right maybe they have all champions in their hand right maybe they got scared them out that level up and just get champions in their hand and that kind of just set them far behind because they didn't have a reaction to deal with our sea monster so we actually survived the 10 10 Karma with the freaking place your bets that's actually crazy ggs in this match it was against Jane and Nora I have been seeing this deck around uh let's see okay we have Savage jettison and she's scared this is a great standing hand potential like Jane and stuff that's that's that's a great draw uh we don't have the soul Harvest or anything like that we can go here all right purple we want to see our sea monsters I guess ah they used to pipe just now they didn't wait for my sister to be on the field okay all right I respect it I guess we can now just wait until we have lowered the depths and just shoot this up for one minute or less I think that's fine right we'll wait until we have lower on the field and then this is gonna cost one less we undergo to kill that Nora so we undergo to kill the Nora which is the second layer unfortunately that way the opponent doesn't get the portals because they rely on the portals to kind of stay alive 27 learn C scare or C scare that's pretty good I don't think opponent has a good way to kill the six cab combo if we play with C scale we still have enough for benches and that's then yeah so we can still just go ahead and binge that jet and stop the gym from getting some skill value here maybe we just maokai though how does America sound to me answers sounds pretty good for me I'll take these four should have a way to kill this we go for the ship recorder are you going for the chip recorder which is kind of weird by the way because he's adding two cars into a hand into our deck sign then we have the womb boom we're still pretty close and this is gonna get us two here and then we play Nautilus and we're chilling so jettison almost gets us there so the yetisan almost gets us there again we can always Vengeance the Gin netstand so I'm not too concerned about this game and their big finisher which is gonna be their uh reptile rats it's not gonna be so big where we have all these big units on the field it's crazy because if we if you level a Mark I actually helps them out because okay well do you saw the ports of paluses now then it doesn't matter right that's actually such a good hit from the portapalooza wait no so the opponent is just gonna let me just kill everything okay you just go like this we have jettison yeah we have the jettison right so we have the jettison anytime that we want to it's a reptile wraps that I have to be worried about magic ambers whatever you have here even if you kill this Market I think I'm fine with that hmm it doesn't do anything all right let's go ahead and just play this narulus then all right let's just yeah let's go play Nautilus get some value we know we're gonna have a big level of Nautilus and again this is going to make it really difficult for them for the riptide vets really much you can pretend that you can kill the maokai and that's fine I don't think I care about the Mark I kill you can't really kill anything else a second gen all right so the male cat even stay salahi unfortunately we do set the Bower we lose at the bower and the egg is not really doing much this this uh for us so oh look at that another who so we can just be back when it gives me a draw as well I'll take that oh look at that treasured throw okay so let's go ahead and kill the Gin for now stop the Gen from actually having any value we can also just level up our maokai right here if the James has no value I think I'm fine with this opponent could trigger okay they wanna they wanna level up this route they want to kill this maokai but we can just level it up the whole deck if they didn't have the red side rats right now then they're not gonna get there they also have joined more with this new fetch new fish right yeah we can let this we can let this Malachi die I think I'm fine with that opponent has to block everywhere else pretty much now we still have the treasure throw after attack you have a second marker we can play treasure Trove we can trade everything and still have the plate worm okay so let's just go like this again just if the opponent wants to trade I think I'm fine with that the portals are only gonna the portals are gonna be in the deck as well and they're gonna definitely get them 20 gets an elusive here we have the band game so I'm not too concerned about this okay the opponing actually ended up using it now so that's cool what did we draw what are we just draw instead see what we get we can so Harvest right now and just kill this knuckle we have vengeance so the opponent was to yeah we have bangers for them I mean when I could get that when I could get that uh that first that one photo but we have benches for the Nora so I'm not too concerned about this and the new fish is making the draw which is helping us out and they didn't even get that draw anyways okay they could get the portals now for sure you're gonna continue drawing wow and you don't have enough for Riptide rats we just bentons this guy that's your portals you have one car left I guess let's play the treasure Pro and that's game yeah I mean we our units get really big right so we're at the compression then we have enough removal for the for the no wrap for the Gin so the opponent really does have a good chance of get doing anything there so you just in this match if we're going against vaults of Helios and nasus bolts of Helia uh no no no no tempting tempting but no I think I just want to go deep as soon as possible this Nautilus is going to be a big threat for nasus to deal with so I want to go deep as soon as possible I didn't like keeping the Salvage in the opening hand because just like it happened right now drawn into double Savage is not really great we want to look for our sea scarabs and our lower cheaper units unfortunately we don't get the C square or a lure of the deaths and that's kind of frustrating but that's okay the point is going to go for there yeah Rock Shepherd we'll go ahead for The Wanderer that's our drag dragons that's a drug Traders I I don't even want a gift in this like I don't even want to give them this because I want to be able to potentially block that rock band I mean I don't think he matters but uh like the opponent cannot play the bolts of Helia here so that's good for us maybe we just Salvage what else can we do right second one okay so it's not a bolts of Helia so that's good startup bolts of Helia so if they don't get the bolts of Helia and we can slow them down that's great the point is the opponent is that the opponent is gonna have double Rock Bear right here right yeah the opponent gets the Double Rock bear we can learn okay see scrap is good this cap is good we cannot go deep right now though and we're just gonna lose to this rock I mean this is why we kept that one there right ah yeah yeah this is gonna be fun five seven nine so five seven five seven nine ten eleven we're going down to five doesn't really matter which one we do it we go here let's go undergo and just drain this out right now we have we are about to go deep we can go abyssalai and then be able to go deep next there and then hopefully withdraw something that we can play okay that's a playable car so I do like going deep with the jettison let's go drag Traders let's go direct dread just a blocker we have blockers here and here and then we can just play Nautilus as well to block the NASA's you you can't you you can't do this right I mean there's no way that this is correct you're gonna give me the nasus so this is telling me rekindler then so if this is a rekindler could also be a bengins right could also be a Vengeance I'm gonna I'm gonna Force the Bank inside I'm gonna Force the bank this out by playing this first Nautilus we have a second Nautilus in our hand so this is this has to be abandons right there's no way you play I mean you can't play with Kendra you have no more space anyways so it has to be abandons what unfortunately luckily for the opponent we didn't get any other freaking foreign like deep unit right we end up getting one now so that's cool we can actually try to get whichever one of these we get is actually probably good right so we should probably just go for the jettison here it's a jettison or it's a dredgers maybe it's draggers right the dragons gives me a blocker yeah both of these are pretty good for us and we can just pass here we take four actually not even four because we can go ahead and do the uh the underdraw so we can go I don't even want to take that much damage with this one we can go ahead and do it like this uh now I guess we're gonna go here right we can go undergo and just at least at least take no damage when it gets to trade with the draggers no bolts of Helia feels really bad for the opponent this has to be a pendants now right you get double the draw now that's the only downside rather negation so are we okay with this that's one less rather negation for us later now let's go ahead and do the second on the grill let's go ahead and not take that extra two damage if we don't need to all right we have three five six we need to use one more car for us to be able to use the Treasure Trove I don't think we do anything right now there's their nasus right so check this out we can go kill breaker you can go kill breaker into deaths to borrow the deaths and that obliterates the nasas we can keep our Nautilus it also allows us for the open attack right so we go here and this is gonna be a nasty open attack upon it has a Kinder in their hand but they couldn't play with Candler because their board was full so it wasn't until this turn that we actually allowed them to be able to play that we can't do it that's also why I don't think it was important for us to go for the kill break elaster we could just easily waited for this year I think the opponent's writing negation was a little bit too too jumpy so ggs in this match if we're going against sunny okay okay okay action Raven huh okay this the power is tempting does they'll probably have a way to kill this mild guy do they have a way to kill this maokai I don't know I don't know Let's uh let's see this on the group is huge I might actually just keep the Mana for the underground so that we can kill the action on turn two so I'm gonna keep this undergrowth Mana oh that's not an action okay so I guess we can go ahead and just play the dredgers oh Double C square and oh man the c-scap and double layer that kind of sucks all right yeah that's cool with me that's one less Sean you have to worry about later for maokai bangus is gonna be huge sale um let's do it let's go for it let's eat it up let's eat it up that's the third Lord got the quick attack thing that's fine they didn't I'll go ahead and just toss this Malachi and I really don't think that he has a really good way to deal with it with his mouth guy so I'm gonna just toss the Malta in there and see what the opponent does they get their palace I guess they could have the removal now they got the strike they could have a strike here that is problematic hmm retire reckoner Danger let's go here this is a four one that can block quite a bit of things here opponent has only one blade that they have used that they have yet to use I guess we're gonna block with this one no need to block with the gel Hunters let's go jettison right now because we have the Mana for it so we can go jettison right now because we have the Mana for it and then we're gonna go deep pretty shortly we still have benches and unfortunately for yeah unfortunately for snowy this is uh this is not gonna go too well for them because now we have this big block this big attacker like we don't even I'm not even gonna spend the mega test to be honest because I know that I can just play it for free with Nautilus next there I'm Gonna Keep the Vengeance here to get rid of one of their units and can I just go from there yeah so like we can go here and then we can just keep the bang dance to kill the reckoner so we can keep the Vengeance to kill the reckoner whenever we want I guess I could level up mauka to be honest if I would just attacked with everything but I think malaka just levels up no matter what I'm raised by so let's just go here I'm playing with fire letting that Rhythm stay alive I am playing with fire letting that ribbon stay alive I will I will admit that because now she gets double the blades so the opponent gets double the blade we get the big Nautilus and we tapped out of answers right so who he otk me possible it's possible yeah he cannot deal with the Nautilus he's a big it's a big help unit right so the opponent lost their Challenger earlier I don't think they could have dealt with this Nautilus right there on turn seven so ggs in this match we're going against Bane and eight trucks okay we can go deep before they can get to their big boy we should be okay I like the undergrowth I like the undergrowth as a way to kill wow this this hand is amazing I like the undergo as a way to kill the Valor right so putting only Mulligan one car away this is probably one of the best hands that we could have gotten right so I can undergo this I can play Dratch draggers it doesn't really matter okay so we can take this damage now and we can just wait until night later on to do this let's go ahead and play the drag dredgers now we can go learn the devs and then play the seascara I guess opponent could technically have the oh there we go Double C Square app yeah this is uh this is the hand that I want this is the hand that I want the two have fish fight right I guess if you have fish fight what's my thought regardless these are great this is a great great hit because now we can attack like this but when it cannot really block this no matter what I'm gonna get at least some value and then we still have the undergo as well to keep one of these alive so we have the undergo to keep one of these alive opponent can never really Sky attack right if this cat attack here they're just helping us out because I just sacrificed my deck drag dredgers you just helped me out so I just get I get double the toss that I wouldn't have gotten otherwise I don't get it we are very close now to going B 23 kill this flea feather tracker we're still planning to replay the equipment and also puts that when I've won so then we go like this three more this gets me down to 18. ironically the downside here is the fact that we don't have enough cards in our hand now so I guess we can't we can go deep right we can go deep very easily here I just I can just pass I could just passed see what the opponent does first we have the bengans and the undergrowth well we don't have the benches right now but we can just pass for now have the undergrowth as a backup the Challenger is cute but doesn't really do much I just push two damage what am I scared of here I guess they're probably having the quick attack is a problem you just go like this right just push the two damage at least opponent should never block this they're gonna give this quick attack but we can bend and set away like we went deep so fast that we don't have Nautilus enable and that's kind of funny like we actually don't have Nautilus enable and that's actually freaking hilarious I guess I could have just done this first and then if the opponent wanted to block with the fact that I would have been okay with me we go like this and we chill and then next we play Nautilus and opponent can't do anything against Nautilus Soul Harbors can kill cheaper units this guy doesn't do anything and that's the game next time we play Nautilus and I don't think opponent can do anything versus marvelous the only thing there is that I probably should have just like going for my five six attack and I would have saved the pages in my hand so welcome back everyone hope you enjoyed today's games with deep you kind of see what what Sunny was talking about right like that game against him was kind of just a non-game like we're just gonna face rule went Deep by turn seven we had Nautilus we win the game all the games like that Karma set game you can get a little bit more Awkward hands and not be able to go deep as fast as you would like to you saw that we ended up tossing all three garrisons and that feels really bad sometimes and those are the games that end up dragging on but even those games once you get deep it can be really difficult for the opponent to deal with just how much value you have honestly rotation I feel like cash made deep a top tier deck because a lot of the things they used to play on this deck are no longer around so it's very hard for a lot of decks to go under deep before they get to do what they want to do because think about it this deck really didn't lose anything from rotation like I said for like bile fees everything else here is literally that SATs and deckless as you have played a year ago which is crazy when you think about it heck even without battle fees instead of biophies now we have soul Harvest which a lot of times can feel even better depending on the matchup that you want to get so yeah I mean I I mean I'm happy that dick is doing well but I can understand the frustrations that players like on Reddit and Twitter and twitch might have with teeth because a lot of the games can't just be decided just on the flip of like whether you get a crazy curve or not but regardless we had a lot of fun showcasing deep and I hope you had a lot of fun learning and seeing us play deep in terms of my general strategy with this that you kind of saw it in every game that we play I want to go deep as fast as I can so what I mean by that is that any sea monster so megatus besolize the bower Nautilus recorder even the vengeances um and sometimes even the Joe Hunters as well and the Soul Harvest and kicking all of that away in my Mulligan the cards that I want to see are the drag Traders the jettison's the seascar apps the devil Wonder The Lure of the deaths the underground Salvage and sometimes my okay malca is dependent on whether your opponent wants to removing on that so this deck is kind of like the two halves right so it's like the story of Two Cities the first one is your early game and all you want to do is have cars that say tossing them again just all those cards that I went through you want to just have to scarcely on try to toss as much as possible go deep and then from there the game becomes a lot easier the second half of the deck is your deep monster so once you actually go deep that's when you want to have your Nautilus and that's when you want to start drawing your devours and your episode your mega test your shipment holder and you'll start putting a lot of pressure into the opponent so again the strategy is simple go deep as fast as possible and then transition to the sea monster if you have a car in your hand that says toss you want to keep it the only ones that are a little bit questionable are Malachi and Salvage unless if I really see that I have like that dredgers and I have a c scare and I have a double Wonder then I'll kick the marker in the Salvage shot if I see that my hand is like 3C monsters and only and one Salvage I think I have to keep that Salvage because there's a risk that I might get a bunch of sea monsters again and I need something that can kind of fix my head that's what Savage is good I not only is it tossing but it's when you draw two which kind of lets you fix your hand when you have some aqua heads but again it's gonna be match of the pendant but you usually want to get everything that has toss in your hand to begin with and let the rest go now once you actually get you know to to the mid game and you actually have the cards that you need in your hand always have like the C scare up is gonna be the removal number one for the opponent they're always going to want to remove this always always always so just be careful when you play him either you know like a lot of times you have to be mindful when you're playing like if you can get at least one if you can get like two c scales and they feel at the same time you're already like inner gets back but if the six Cara dies right away before any of your other units die then you're only getting one toss which is not great not bad but also not great so just be careful when you put the C scare up although a lot of times it's fine to just drop in right away and then just try try to attack with your stretchers because if they block it and they're giving you the task with the c scare uh the Joe Hunters just be mindful of the removal that the opponent can do lower the desk is one of the questions you want the most obviously you wanna you wanna just draw this car and just play it and hopefully you get a c Square then you can play for one less cost Etc um let's see what else what else what else can really be said here the bad word use your main removal together with vengeance just keep your bangers for your main units and then I mean you again like okay I don't want to say it but I think let's talk about the elephant another one this deck is a bit brainless all right I I like I'm trying to like give you guys like strategies but it's just very straightforward it's just toss go deep and then play your sea monsters play your nados it's uh yes there's gonna be some turns depending on the matchup where you gotta be like okay I can't play this because they could have died I could can't do this because they have that they could land somebody power they could bounce back my Nautilus they could kill my mouth guys so I can't play my yeah this there's some decision making involved but for the most part you're kind of just rolling face and those decision points are few in when you're playing deep so it is a good beginner friendly deck for that reason although it is very expensive you kind of have like all I guess it's like I guess I guess it's not that many deep there's not many uh aside from the bower and the hoarder there's not that many epic cards so you only have to do four epic cards six Champions and then you have a lot of comments and comments so yeah I think it's a good beginner friendly deck just for that reason because it's something that you can just use to just get a client pass if you need a way to just climb fast and be able to find resources for better decks in the future but it's doing really well in the stacks it's dominating certain matchups and that is search Merit on its own I do think maybe it needs to be turned down just a little bit because it's not as fun to play against when they just roll the perfect hand but anyways enough of me ranting hope you enjoy today's games if you did make sure to like them below and subscribe to us we post LOL videos every single day because let's finish on Twitter to sectional machine let me know and then and you can just find us on this for and Twitter the links to those are both in the description below thank you so much for watching hope you enjoyed going deep and I'll see you all again tomorrow ","21":"oh my God [Music] [Music] I'm in danger this this is not okay I'm tired of stuff [Music] I'm about to end this man's whole career boom bam bop [Music] are you sure about that Mike stop right there [Music] huh [Music] you better stop what did you think nice [Music] I'm really mad [Music] hmm no no no no [Music] foreign [Music] oh no yeah boy I'm walking here Hi how are you another one huh [Music] [Applause] [Music] ","22":null,"23":"all right Gamers we are back for another game of gin the diamond this game we're going to be playing General NADA and tequila and Morgana and this in this video we're once again gonna be doing the Kraken slurgeon I'll probably just keep using that belt for probably the entirety of the series unless I find that it I decide that it's only good situationally but until then like we're just gonna keep experimenting with it so we're going to cleanse this game since it's absolutely obligatory against Morgana Caitlyn can't afford to network Clans against Morgana especially if her ADC is something that synergizes well with root which in Caitlyn's case will be the traps can't afford to get double CC then Lane every time we're gonna hit the binding because we'll just get one shot guess we're starting off a small advantage in this push against enemy bot Lane we'll use Qatar so we can maintain the first shot for a little bit longer because Killen doesn't really want to walk up until we've used it we can't walk up to like Zone her from that melee because that's too overextended but we can stand next to the Costa that was dropping make sure she doesn't get that I mean she can't get it but then she would have to eat one of herodos there we go nice one outside just keep on slow pushing for another thing let's see how that goes vehicle walks up for the Trap we walk up the zoner off can stop replacing the Trap first solution missed it anyway but even if she had landed up we at least get some return damage onto her so she doesn't get free damage onto our support I want to try and fourth shot a champion here there we go we should go place a trap oh sorry award now and we're also going to need cleansing team pass from of course I only just noticed the amuma though foreign Mana we don't want to add a third ability to our rotation when we can barely afford to use two as it is nope don't need to cleanse her yeah so we won't die there if we get hit by the killing Cube it'll certainly take a lot of damage that we'd rather avoid okay so we just cleanse ah my bad at the same time though we shouldn't instaclance because we want to actually bait to calendar to just walking forwards and using the Trap where she might just take a necessary Minion aggro or a damage from uh Renata there's pretty much no harm in me just sitting on the binding for a little bit all right nice one still get got the advantage in Lane anyway should go Place Another Ward oh that kind of looked like a script but it might have just been a nice Dodge split against the scripture yesterday so I'm already literally actually my last game was against the scripter literally uh we can just leave this here actually this would take so long to shove no no stop hitting it never mind it's not gonna let it happen okay we shove it just fine but we could have just left the pushing towards us as well I think that would have denied well I suppose both ways that I have about the same Farm thought they would oh okay Warwick okay well listen first start I guess GG all right Gamers we are back for another game of gentle Diamond this time playing gin Leona to Twitch Katarina I guess no not twitch Karina oh these games are just an absolute mess aren't they huh okay okay well I guess we'll just start off slow pushing the focus here should be to deny as much farm and possibly even XP from twitch as possible hello I see them expect you don't have to be here we'll just be aggressive on Twitter now push the full combo on them and now leave now go oh my Lord though cage sheesh okay who was AFK again I guess you didn't want to play that out which is fair enough on to the next game all right Gamers we are back for another gen game hopefully this one it's actually gonna be a real game um a level w ooh blocked by Warwick or Yorick rather up I got cleanse if I need it I should have flashed on someone there okay not bad not bad it's gonna be too late for me to base I think but no biggie will uh just eventually base when we can but now we'll just give our jungler a leash yeah I probably should just flash forwards onto ashther and just one shot her with the fourth shot should be good to live there you're gonna have to take a third shot since we still have cleanse to remove any further CC that hits us okay let me bottom missing on a farm I guess sash didn't need the base so nice one that's gonna be really nice you're gonna have a very delayed level too okay my thinking is we probably want to slow push this with and crash on the third wave yeah let's do it we've got a pretty big wave here it'll make it easy to shove this in it's fine if it doesn't tether I was mainly focusing on the minions oh my God this isn't getting me into zero loss that's I need the books on the Canon here I might just have to miss this melee yeah all right now we just base we're basing this other brush and television there so I'm gonna hit that for her support item if she wants you can always just cancel my best if they go really aggressive trying to engage on her I'll pick up double long sword here and yes of course we're just running cleanse this game as well by the way since um this guy CC this guy CC this guy CC this guy CC skyvin has a big slow which we might want to cleanse at some point it's gonna be overall a pretty annoying game I think generally you'd prefer gilforce against Nocturne but at the same time a lot of like a lot of the time it just feels useless against them anyway because the gale force Gap does um Dash doesn't actually break the noctany unless he really messes up so it's just awkward to play Gin against knocked and even at the best of times we're just gonna go with the Kraken Slayer and see if we can just completely run away from them we're just gonna respect right now the fact that they have the bigger width even if they're behind oh she's gonna try on base there that would not be a good base timing though when they haven't secured this crash because I just want to freeze this so I just Tangled the wave a little bit check it up to the brush now they're kind of forced to stay and now I want to work on thinning this out as hard as I can so we're gonna place a trap there we just ignore Ash we don't really want to hit the enemies well actually we've manually thinned it out enough that we could actually look for trades now maybe but the better we think the more we thinned it out the better the trades will be because the less minionacker we will take all right perfect we've thinned it out at this point we're in a position where the enemies if they ever want the base are gonna have to miss out on a wave which will crash under turret but if they don't base they're going to be landing at a uh like ash was just down like two long stars on me when she could at least run make up for some of that with a bass you know so there's just not a huge disadvantage until they're based but they're never going to base without giving up even more of a disadvantage so let's just lose lose for them we'll go play some Vision over here uh could also do is just checking if they have a blast cone thankfully I don't have to check with my trinket I can just leave a trap there getting one soon I forgot when that spawns I've always forgot to check that nice one and that should be not a kill but just a lot of damage done onto Ash Ash is even more desperate to have to recall soon so if she were the base now we'll be on a kind of wish so this would probably be her best chance to try and get a good base but I mean if I were her I would just soak up this last cannon with well maybe not because you could die here but generally I would prefer to soak up the kind of wave than based on another whiff because he would rather give up a regular whip than a cannon with and they're fairly unlikely to get away with not giving up on Empire wave in this situation uh we could shove another wave as well use traps first since it's really cheap with clear and at this stage of the game our kid doesn't do too much more damage the minions are perfect now we base again Honestly though probably would have been better to just shove that kind of whip because that took us forever maybe because Santa wasn't really helping Michelle but still I don't really get a much better base for doing that I'll just get swifties make it easier to dodge we're gonna accuse me because I'm not quite so by Ash's slows what is this part thing yeah we're gonna miss some for him here sadly should have just uh based on the cannon wave I was thinking would shove it in a timely manner just because of how quickly we could reach it but didn't quite work out that way oh this Morgana has first strike not comet okay so our advantage and stats is now significantly less great because uh she matched my double launchers with double lenses of around but I've also got a lot of moon speed to get in range for trades when I actually do have the advantage such as now when Santa just did a ton of damage probably I should have actually aimed that fourth shot onto Ash I didn't think she would turn around but she did I should have been checking for that you want to like give the opponent time to see if they will make a mistake sometimes I was in no rush to use my foot shot on Morgana there I had a little bit of time where I could afford to wait a gun and we'll miss away for that hopefully uh this isn't quite under turret yet kind of awkward that this wasn't into turret oh well just gonna reduce the amount of form that they miss um okay we'll base here the next wave is a cannon wave and I'm running low on Mana even though I have too much gold to spend so hopefully my recall doesn't get canceled here nice one they should have been throwing blind skills into that like the Morgana w ashw I can't really pick up anything else here we'll just leave I don't like the colors much on gin and it's pretty late for Cole anyway main reason why I like the call is actually not for the gold but for the sustain uh because it's just a flat damage based off of Rod attacks uh Jin is the lowest attack speed in the game so you don't actually get too much healing on gin compared to what it really sees so it's like uh not the greatest example of why I would run coal I don't really get the benefit more from Jin even when our Auto attack is on cooldown there we can still just with the queue while we wait for the Art Attack to be available again that could be a kill on her oh okay let's run this up oh the bounce oh he snared them both damn I was thinking it would only sound Morgana my bad I was waiting for us to walk past Morgana and snare her or was expecting that to happen foreign see the swifties are just really good for getting in range for those Autos if you have a winning matchup then it's just really good for actually abusing your lead whereas uh more ID would just help you win trades that you would otherwise maybe win anyway obviously you would win them harder but it started to force those trades so not necessarily always going to give you the better results especially because of the fourth shot the getting an image for the fourth shot just even once yields so much more damage than you could deal with buying more ID oh didn't find that right anyway I suppose we should be able to jump this with yeah we have a much better wave clear now and sun is actually helping us as well this time if I had the meta already I would just play some crap right in the brush right before I recall but it's not worth the laying my recall for if I don't immediately have the Mana for it and we can width and gold here we're waiting for a minute anyway foreign not really worth cleansing that just avoid damage would rather save it for a life-threatening situation okay it's definitely gonna be much riskier to try and force trades now that Ash is level six level seven even we're gonna wait for better opportunities now since they're she's actually a lot more threatening both of them are we have cleanse but we go in Asher since she does more DPS Ash can't really afford to ignore me so she shouldn't have what the hell up out it went up okay we got her a nice one so I actually obviously wanted to blow up on the Morgana binding there but the best thing we can do is just go on ash flash instead of following that up either has to start focusing me which is awkward because her support isn't focusing me and she has no guarantee to win this because I'm I have a lead or she just has to retreat and then Morgana isn't getting follow up on her engage oh I'm in trouble here I should have cleansed there was a slow there that I could have cleansed my butt but plans that I think I would have been fine there because I'd move the speed from flip oh well that was a good Crush him I might miss a planning there well whip then do we have another quick look I don't really have to wait yeah we'll do Phantom that's the second item should be really good for cutting the knock down then I think we'll just do Infinity Edge third instead of them but we'll see I don't know because I mean with my kind of we get a lot more Moon speed as well still not quite as much room speed as we get from Clark from uh Phantom necessary okay at least this way we still have cleanse up or a fight on bot Lane in case we need that and potentially the Clans wouldn't have saved us anyway okay this could be good oh no no my bad oh son of a q no she just missed out on the morganical even the ash kill because you're Mr Q she clicked I don't know how she clicked the minion there that's sad um I don't know if I should only just came up or but she was just holding it for no reason your team has destroyed that doesn't even make sense that you can cue that opinion but I won't question it like the only way that makes any sense whatsoever is if she's just attack moving attack moving by just clicking like on herself no but that wouldn't even happen because she would be clicking she would be all attacking minutes as well I don't understand how that could have happened oh well uh it just cost me away potentially okay I got most of it okay next one I was gonna say I'll get this Cannon and then follow up with melt since she's nasty City the way so it doesn't really matter when I follow up the field just as long as I stay in range for it oh my bad I probably could not have beat him to first start anyway but I didn't notice that I was trying to race him oh yeah could maybe get knocked down isn't he still here yeah Diana hello it was right here we saw him there what oh God I'm so aren't I ah damn it such a lucky timing but what the hell was that Diana hmm kind of disappointing look we went into that kind of knowing that she was retreating but at the same time we didn't know she would keep on retreating even once we revealed nothing was there which she somehow forgot about clearly knew he was there look it looks like she's walking towards them Unstoppable weird I misunderstood um I would try and chase them down only I don't have cleanse so it would be overly aggressive here I think okay well she's got no cue now at least I probably just canceled the ashes base that's nice nice okay we'll group mid now where there's more likely to be action going on especially with the hurled up and even without fighting over the herald there's already action all right that she should be dead perfect I'm almost dead too though probably not it's gonna be in time to do anything here so I'll just Farm and we should just do the herald now Dr wants to steal this is gonna have to give his life for it actually I just want to make sure he doesn't have a blast gun because that would be very inconvenient all right all good okay oh nice one I should have closed the sooner because I could actually kill her realized that too late nice one yep nice we got the cannon early I have enough for Phantom nuts or no somebody should go about uh honestly I would have been fine with a moment taking the form but he's going to go for us instead okay well now he's just gonna take the form but leave that stand with me rotating just to get that I think if there's gonna be no way of waiting for me after that since I'm not gonna be in time to get most of that wave anyway foreign ature anyway should be a free Drake just leave my last fourth shot on the Drake now go defend mid oh got hit by that all good damn it didn't get her nice one should I use my flashlight on the Canon actually I am at my best only during the before I've flush to try and escape the Nocturne Fields me so we can start a bait with that oh yeah we can finish this hopefully I don't die here I'm very dead here if nothing wants me to be but he didn't nice volts still gonna need to run though oh she does have ultican what the close one I don't have money for old so all right let's get out of here yeah this is just too perfect honestly I think otherwise I would have just gone for got the Zealand not just the Zeal I was gonna say Zealand dagger but that would be the same called as BF sword which is the whole point of going BF sword so we'll do I'm gonna Touch third item and then either Park on another flop is the fourth atom I think other one should be fine protection isn't good enough yes legendary should just try and get the sinhub I guess oh God okay it's not for me and I sniped there hmm oh I had to send a die so fast we got cleanse if I need it here oh that didn't kill them what I was hoping they'll do a billion damage to her by killing every goal here we keep borrowing instead of killing so we keep getting more movement speed nice easy kill her some moment there's a bill in damage by the way if we can get burned now or we just run Ambush Nocturne because the spell shield so it's quite annoying all right he's caught out won't bother with the w because we just don't need it if I stop to cast W and then miss somehow I might not even be the most water attack anymore or at the barely still lose distance on him so it's a small risk when we know we can just chase him down foreign never mind I thought he was basing we can get another dagger here now building into Zeal I don't think I need to bother with armor pen we'll just kite around deal damage through movement speed okay one Drake and we've got soul just make sure they're not on that I should be able to escape knockdon if he tries to open me here okay it's not on me damn it someone was a monster as usual though Focus York is the product Target too oh my God the samomu what Jesus he's not even he has one AP atom and I don't understand his damage nice one uh we'll just get the blue right now since I guess it's not really possible to push turrets at the moment and we could also dismiss Brazil now I think I may as well because the moon was only just leaving base so until your arrives are not gonna be fighting anyway gives us a small window to do this could have probably also sold during split for coaches but whatever it's not a big deal it's only a 700 gold component in fact actually I'm not even sure that would be worth it to think of it it's barely better than the dagger besides the energize Mr Trump got knocked on here is being greedy trying to get the red Buff when we have so much map control should have killed actually for the Lost set no worries doesn't matter too much but I just certainly just saved the fourth shot for knockdown damage oh nice one we just carried out of that oh nice predict she almost got me yeah I think regular gin would have been  there who knows the girl first active would have saved me we just get more overall Mobility with this build fuel force is only very very temporary good thing at the cleanse there that's for sure let's play it safe with the Flash she's dead just get through so much damage because the movement speed is just so good at enabling okay she has no charm now dead whoa what what the Q before the fourth shot my bad okay let's just take down the maiden we can rather not be walking up to the our Rebel Champions just because of the risk of getting Charmed got her oh I almost missed that onto Mecca it's gonna be gone for me let's try and Sprint that nice one all right GG that was a fun game all right Gamers we are back hopefully this is the same amuma as the previous game that guy was cracked I was actually trying to time my photo that I'll sit there I did not realize that I didn't have fourth shots charged already I missed 10 models I'm a second to kill Sonora should we go and kill on here Hmm this could be very good yes yep but the stroke it should be completely free oh that was bad Synergy though so I have needed to be more patient there we could cleanse that but we're not gonna get rich kill him anyway unless actually that's even without cleansing oh nice one shoga he redeemed himself all right we don't get to spend our gold in the end but that's well worth it just now uh wait this is a Muma support Oh I thought that was our jungler yeah well worth it just have more gold I guess that's not gonna be say my mom was the previous game then but hopefully it's just as good already off their great start we can literally just shove this wave and recall there's no point staying rather than that like longer than one wave here there we go managed to get every CS there let's get the double long sword perfect I think the order I actually like to buy items on Jin by the way it's just like double long sword in this 50s this one feels great to me I don't find much point in finishing the noon quiver since it doesn't give you that much more ID and you don't push the wave too much faster anyway because you don't have attack speed to abuse the additional 28 damage to minions so you just get double long serve for a solid amount of AD then Swift is for just general Mobility for bullying I actually didn't miss a single minute for this recall by the way okay I missed that last hit but uh we didn't miss any XP whatsoever that's really nice we did lose prior on the wave though but it is what it is that's worth it just have the double long swords you can use the movement speed from our fourth shot onto the minion to actually get him range to use q1 kill until that's a nice trick to watch out for oh my bad I forgot about him I'll surrender angle that's all I'd get the last set and also Hit The Killing wasn't really worth it just to get one custom minion honestly ooh hitland we want to ignore the Zyra only for circular in here and eventually we'll get Caitlyn last one all right we're not gonna kill Zyra so we're just gonna go for the rest of the wave now hmm we're not quite gonna be able to crash this wave so we may as well just focus on slow pushing it instead we have a lot of Liberty on how far we can trench of it while it's still being a slow push though it's because it's so hard to crash but accident even if I wanted to well I don't it wouldn't be an accident if I wanted to but you got what I'm saying so that's why we can shove this will be the crash I'll use e since uh it's a very cost efficient with Claire oh I need just one more trap there we go you want a moment just clear it clear it all right perfect now with this so long as I can see that they're not freezing this do they have Vision here uh this seems like they do they do they knew that for a fact that it was exactly in that brush it seems uh we have lay on the way but quiet and convenient this could be really good so we're really overextended there a moment didn't really punish it though I guess we'll go and kill him instead I missed it uh my bad my bad my bad didn't mean to get into arrange their house playing with fire yeah no problem flashing better save that happiness all right listen bass I definitely would have preferred the base there that was pretty awkward to try and make a play there they definitely overextended but I think which should have probably given up on it when a moment just didn't immediately punish the Zar over extension instead he started retreating when like this is so bad of Zyra and so bad of a movement not to punish it right here should have been killing her oh hello I'm already in Lane oh this is killing way over staying as well though nice one don't even bother using the W because it's just completely Overkill she's gonna die no matter what so I'd rather just make sure that I'm walking into the range of her making sure that I'm available to take the kill for myself because I'd rather have it on me than listen wow we couldn't just honestly yeah we can base here we'll just base for a quick look uh noon cover there we go whole lot of recalling or at least recall attempting Oh no I got better than canceling this oh okay Karen is on the way I think this might be worth it foreign oh no [Music] um didn't get her that sucks oh hello no well that sucks my bad I should have probably left there if I flush through that wall drop another my bad in the chat you haven't taken somebody recall every time I want the recolor at least this means I get to go with pickaxe instead of quick look though and I think I did get one kill there didn't I living though okay if a woman can freeze here that would be nice even just attempting to freeze it keeps killing and leaning longer which makes her recall worse now she's gonna screed again we just ignore those casters we want to cancel our base she has no e does she what is she doing she's dead here yeah this time she actually she did want a base instead of greeting in lane for more Farm more kills or whatever she was doing before but this time she actually just greeted for a really good base like obviously I think most players would not punish that right I think most players would have just gone for those casters but I'm aware that killing is trying to get a recall and she's obviously going to try and recall uh really like uh without venturing too far out like not gonna walk all the way to her through it because she wants to get a good recall right but it was already kind of too late for that because he's already messed up by staying for so long trying to punish their Mumu when there was no game for that she needed to recall she wasn't going to be around to punish the mumu being low HP so she's delayed a RICO long enough that I can just go for her there and obviously she didn't need to die for that she just needed to cancel her base and leave but uh the only reason she was in that position was taking far too long to recall I guess I don't get the recall here either though it's fine however we hit here it's going to do a lot of damage hopefully we hit every shot oh okay I think I was gonna miss the last one anyway so listen to this damage to Zyra it was really nice once again killer should probably be looking to recall her okay she's not when do we have the Momo level six oh God what is this obscene damage I think I have IQ there I wasn't paying attention okay she's trying to recall but I know the exact spot she's recalling in oh okay I was gonna use W answer base which is already recorded HP she must have had uh potions oh  I'm actually dead to that my bad I'm only just hit level six kind of a shame so go for a dagger once again doing the phantom dancer second item should be decent against that comp since they have three melees the comp were more range focused I would just probably do Infinity Edge second item oh this should be a go right close to the level no she does use it that doesn't matter she's still got the same kills anyway okay Nelson John is running now we use w we don't we don't want to use W when she's running towards us because that's exactly where we want her to go we know we're not gonna we know she's not gonna kill Karen anyway so the moment she knows she has to retreat that's when we want to use w ow then you'll look alone anyway sadly but that's the thought process you should have there I don't need a place yet no it's just that good she plays really aggressively like some but a lot of her aggression is actually good that was a really close fight if I hadn't landed that W I think she actually might have stood a chance of winning it was really close if she she also could have landed a net which would have put her a lot closer to winning there just because it's not working out for though I doesn't mean that like she's playing stupid or anything like um I mean she's her macro seems pretty bad but her knowledge went to go aggressive it's actually decent and she doesn't just uh stop going aggressive uh when she's put done a slight punish she keeps trying to go for like maximizing rodos which is really really good like every time she up detects an opportunity to go aggressive she goes really aggressive so long as she knows she's not gonna get punished this time like this time she was wrong she was just wrong about like how she would win that 1v1 but it was it like again it was just down to execution mainly I executed it slightly better I think overall killing should have been Advantage there though and she and I've almost won it at this point though she would be trolling if she keeps going aggressive because she's just farther behind now yeah my point exactly I guess seriously Anonymous with this you need to put a lot more definitely at that point because you saw how close that fight was right it was down to an execution difference but at that point I just arriving to land with four more items than her and that now I don't even need to play it a lot better than her or slightly better than her I just need to play it and I will win she should have realized that yeah oh if that landed though hello does she have helped her doesn't matter oh hello okay may as well avoid the first shot since I might need to flash the next shot anyway thankfully I'm not low enough to die to kill and I'll tear that would be awkward just get my first shot on the turret and you see she doesn't just stop all attacking umu once and then moves the minions she gets like three others in there it's really good I wouldn't be shocked if she's a Smurf I have to care too much about killing walking up to me there because we do have a Momo kind of protecting us there shouldn't have tried to use a key though unless she actually kept on walking towards me yeah she plays a lot better at the like having the right amount of aggression than most loyal players do if she were actually winning she would be getting a huge Advantage from the way she's playing and it's uh very unfortunate that she isn't winning because it was one close fight we had earlier and now the lane just looks like this which is a bit rough for her [Music] but I kind of just makes it extremely or sorry Phantom Nasser just makes it extremely easy to chase her down would say line to One Auto you should not be trying to trade at all now unfortunately for her I'm just as good at it's exerting the right amount of aggression that she as uh she is because again most players would just like Land one or two others there and not just go For the Kill from Full HP which is what both me and her keep trying to do whenever we have a good fight or a good trade I can push another wave the enemy team is really distracted on Mid and I'm not guaranteed to get there in time to influence the fight I'd rather get the free phone but I'm not gonna be able to push this turret much because Killen is arriving again so I'd rather rotate mid now should be a freaking on her I hope we don't get aggro here we just walk out Jesus ow got her nice one yeah damn it's but it's very important there that I didn't take Agro by hitting Zyra before I was ready to kill her before I wasn't ready to kill her because if I got aggro there always have been so dead we have to wait until her CC is over and we're actually accepting the third wrench before we start hitting her I was hoping I wouldn't have to walk up so far just to even get her but unfortunately she started walking forwards aggressively there's some the same moment that I started the flank her it was a little bit unfortunate I think uh also got another credit there oh I'm very screwed here unfortunately Shame about that but overall it's a good fight for us I probably just had a massive shutdown now yeah 900 gold for yaso is on ideal but it is what it is okay what do we want to do here Infinity Edge or far Canon then we can do fire Cannon I think it'll be really nice here uh you could already tell that I'm just like chasing people down really effectively and I think I I think my damage is gonna be fine no matter what so we'll just get even more chasing power and more range to get our attack speed uh movement speed procs from I think I'll just wait for this far can only but that's it's a lot of time to wait but I think it's worth it this is also very little waves that I could go to at the moment there will be a Bolton wave waiting for me I hope I know actually maybe not should probably push towards them we'll just head towards the Drake eventually this will push the one system probably because it's on our side of the map foreign against yasso though will be his windball will just randomly deny me crits which will just randomly deny me movement speed as well it's gonna be really annoying for my Mobility expecting to have movement speed from monado and then it just gets canceled out Uncle hello okay that's a wasted one well that's really good I keep chasing I keep chasing damn it got her do not let up the aggression if you have the advantage and you're not going to die for continuing to go aggressively that's a big mistake of a lot of low ELO players do killing for all our faults she actually doesn't do that you just keep chasing people down until the end of the Earth if they're not going to kill you for it also crucial towards being a good Ash player as well Jenna Nash are actually both very similar and that is very important for mastering them well at least with this uh gin build anyway what nice one Yep this build is just ridiculous man I  love it if you hit somebody once and then just back off even though you keep if even if you could keep going on them that's just not taking full advantage of what you can do and you're just not gonna find as much disgusts with this build as you otherwise could the whole point of builds like this is that one other lists of 10 moradas if you play your cards right you need to be taking advantage of that to succeed with the student build and with Ash and just with ABC's in general if he can't keep chasing regardless of not having a slower movement speed boost don't just do one Auto and back off be and be happy with just the one Auto attack trade we'll just base here because I have no Mana even though I can't afford my item yet we'll do craiglock I think is very important towards our Mobility to always correct so it's decent for a damage as well at this point anyway since we have so much ad the more ID we have the more effective credit is as well that becomes even more true after you finish the infinity edge itself because it also obviously increases the value of crit by giving you a crit amplifier oh I can't that'll hurt through the wall there we go Mister oh that's not good so we're already getting ready to try and land another order here it'll have to be until we got far coming there we go now we just back off we will die because they were Knocked Up by the zero for sure but we don't have to get Knocked Up by it right I have plans if you know if I get hit by that by the way I need to flash that hopefully it doesn't have one wall um oh my bad okay we're fine okay I got another Minion that I can crib but I didn't credit oh good still overall faster though anyway anyway with uh two Zeal items perfect [Music] we have to wait so long for this turret uh for this mini wave so you can push this through but I guess it's worth it with our death timers team is going but though I guess I'll be alone here maybe I can just get the turret by myself but I probably won't be able to yeah I won't be able to get the internet for sure we'll get this thread and just rotate just making sure I got it okay let's round it GG all right Gamers we are back for another game of gin the diamond I'm gonna be playing jinsara what a nice combo Nico they'll have a level than anything here in case we want the level w ow we have the option of doing that but if nothing's gonna happen we still have the option of leveling Q looks like nothing will happen this game will actually do get to run the ghost which is really nice since they don't have too much to say this time pretty much the only person I would want to see see this game is Nick or cleanse there's CC of is Nico um for the rest of them there's really nothing besides slows uh so it's gonna be really good to run ghost because as much as you might think like maybe it's just a wiggle with how much more speed I get at the same time it enables me to just get in range more easily of that one Auto onto any Champion that could just enable that chain of movement speed bursts that can allow me to get kills if I don't win the ghost it could easily be the difference between just not getting the one out of at least to the massacre I'm not getting it you know so it's really nice even if it may seem Overkill when you are just getting all those human speed boosts and we were playing against the Nico support so I haven't actually played against this on support yet I don't think yeah Treasures at least it's a rework I don't know how much they changed I think they only changed their passive didn't they or maybe her ultimate knocks up now when it didn't perform but that's about it okay with this engage onto us from Ezreal now Whispers be a double Mage matchup gonna be very bursty on both sides it's gonna be very important to try and not get brush down by the Niko at level six foreign nice one that is really good very nice all right let's shove it this way about and then we can base nice one all right now we're base for the double long sword because it's kind of low but nothing we can do to her on the turret so I'll just get another potion in case we end up leaving that I feel like three potions would be Overkill though yeah Ezra launcher is laying with only a tear so that's really brutal gonna be a big difference in inventory I basically have Triple A D components while he has nothing you shouldn't even start at Tyrone Israel for that reason it's just really really bad early on you want to get it on like first base when you can actually get it alongside all the stuff that are um can help your length is or at least having already had the door installed if all you can base in is based on his eighth here okay so our Focus here is just on thinning this out so at the moment he didn't have um gold for buying any more components during that last base he had but he will have after shoving all this so what we want to try and make happen here is that he can't get a clean shove can't get a clean crash so we can't base on it so we're doing a good job with that so far managed to at least the latest is long enough there or delays crash there so now he's trying to stick around for another whiff and hopefully when Zara gets into Lane actually we're gonna just sort of gank them okay this is really good already we'll pop the ghost here coming the first shot for the last hit ideally there we go yeah see he could have if he just crashed one wave cleanly he could have just spaced and grabbed the long sword or doran's blade or Cole whatever he wanted to get thanks but we just keep trying to delay it putting it up putting him off of it so he just keeps staying in Lane in this case it turned out to be the advantage turned out to be that we got a gank that he fell to but otherwise uh the idea is that Zara gets back into Lane and we get prior and then he's not gonna be at the base unless he wants to give up a wave which is going to be a much worse base and he's gonna choose not to do that because who wants to give up a wave but he's just gonna end up having to stay in Lane therefore laning with various components against my Durance blade my long sword and my other long sword while he's literally only got a tear which would be a miserable time in Lane was if we don't try our hardest to stop him from crashing out with he crashes it and then he can just base and get something uh this is gonna be Nico I guess she's actually doing a good job of canceling my base it's a kind of web though so I can actually still base don't touch the wave don't touch the wave that's really bad I hope they don't I hope they just uh break that freeze by continuing to hit it because she did just create a phrase for them if they would actually accept it your mother just cost me a cannon as well if I'm lucky the cannon will live though thankfully I've got W to lost it again with once I arrive and I got swifties oh she said that again oh no I just walked forwards damn that sucks oh well it's really nice by the way if you can manage to root somebody into the Zyra plants which would have happened if I managed to land that they'll be on Nico okay she's gonna flash her she's there nice one I'm managing to get all of the kills so far they're important oh I'm gonna walk up to try and based on this kind of wave but I'm gonna have to since otherwise it's not gonna crash can't get a good base without shoving this in excuse both traps here actually now only one will be necessary here actually nice one managed to shove that and just find this better being kind of with but we only have limited time to make the space work now I might just choose to stay because Ezreal is actually kind of low here I don't have too much Mana to punish that but we might get something oh it flashed that oh no I misclicking the trouble and I was trying to use ghost ah that blows man I think I should have been fine there oh well right of course because I tried to use ghost and it didn't activate I think it only just came up yeah it only just came up at the end that's a bit unfortunate oh man I don't know it might have still been hit by that queue anyway okay we'll get a good Pacer at least yeah was that but by the way there I could have used my w to harass the Nico but I was intentionally just holding on to that Mana so we could hopefully just get the ultimate we needed about 17 Mana for that with the ultimate we actually set a chance of getting kills whereas the W would have only been poke would not have finished anybody off there okay it's gonna be too late to crash this wave to make his room this farm so we may as well just slow push this instead I'm gonna clean a crush later on which will allow us to either poke them more effectively under turret or we go Place Vision which I think Vision will be good I'll just noticed the other Zack by the way I mean obviously I saw it before when I was valuing evaluating whether I needed to cleanse but it only just occurred to me oh they have Zach you can jump on me through walls so probably get some vision for that hitter see if we can pull it up oh that was the real one what okay can I get this plating uh too late um okay this is like we don't need the word yet just barely not a Kill it was the trick now where there may be a contest oh that has rolled sucks for trundle no she's out of range of that plant so she can't kill it so she takes more damage from it nice one I'll use ghost to try and get on the Nico here is that oh okay just barely not to me sadly but I'll take it I'll just drop one Auto and then Escape well leave with bleed so I can just finish upping this in I don't need to shove this in but I definitely prefer to do it since otherwise I miss out on the Canon all right I'm missing oh actually I'm so close to Kraken Slayer that's gonna be awkward turn to shove in with uh no Mana I think I can do it especially if this ever helps all right close enough hopefully that's not the real Nico yeah nice not canceling my base like she should be since I have no Mana so I'm zero threat to her right now I never actually ended up placing that Vision but did we well we got some Vision down it's important to have Vision here in particular it's less likely that he will try to jump on us through this brush unless we're directly under turret would be nice to have a board in that brush as well though if we can reach it Hello whoa she was a minion that wasn't  I didn't even notice ow God that sucks ah I can't get them ready for my first shot to match the trade either kind of risky actually we'll focus Israel because he's the one who'd want to punish me here I missed all of them anyway my bad help just gonna go hit the Golems where I get a full heal with my fleet if I do it onto minimum status like 20 no uh 80 reduced I think I'm not sure since we want to heal up here oh God damn it my bad I keep forgetting oh we have a channel no wonder I left I think there were focusing Zara anyway so I think I would have lived either way but that's the wrong fault but anyway nice one zero zero also managed to hold before she died which made a huge difference there anyway does she do that from the brush or was she like a minion which I didn't notice again I need to review that once I start my recall hopefully still there oh God I'm not gonna get to reveal it then okay hopefully we get away now damn it that was a very unfortunate time for him to Z I think I kill him there though nice good well that was a bit lucky and we don't get to review the nickel thing oh well yeah I guess I'll need to count minions got them I guess I might as well wait on gold there we go okay six minutes here you know what suck is that I it could be it could be that there were seven minutes in that way obviously I know Nico's mid right but I'm speaking hypothetically it could be that there were seven minions in that wave which is sus but one of them died and so now I look over now there's six minions and I don't know if anything's out of place or not because I didn't see the one minion die the Nico passive is actually so useful especially if if they have a slow push going she could easily disguise herself as one of her own minions and I would have no idea oh nice one zoned him from trying to last head since he didn't want to eat my fourth shot okay we see Zach oh dude I was looking at the map nice one this had something I go for the old we get one free shot then we wait for him to use it oh okay nice one during the route we just get one free shot unless maybe if they're max range maybe you don't get the old dolphin time I'm not sure but definitely if they're mid-range to close range the route is enough long enough for one ultimate hit the length we can run him down here even if he's away he's gonna die eventually there we go and we got the full circle too we just got 600 gold from the kill on the turret combined again it's gonna be really good against their comp once more gonna be really good for cutting the both the Olaf and also the Zach given trying to avoid getting in range of his or staying out of Ranger bizarre once he activates that getting out of range of his w ow hopefully managing to avoid his cue even for dodging a z it'll be really nice if we happen to be Auto attacking a minion at the time this could be Nico yes one of them is Nico that's for sure I didn't even counted them but just based his movement felt suspicious for Zach you know it felt more like a Nico movement Zacks don't just walk around in front of Champions when they could be jumping on them I will get a start and just rush towards spot where there will be a wave waiting for me probably gonna miss a cannon but it will come on come on that auto is it yeah I have to try cruelty let's jump back there for some vision shut down you you this performance needs more holy does our old got him nice one can I get Nico probably not where is she God damn it what the hell just pull the Houdini on me only just runs right to the left is [Music] poker with the autism brood like that and because we know it's pretty safe okay you can't reach me we do manage to dodge the Zach you thanks to the movement speed and that's freaking on Nico I hope ah damn it okay nice and we're just fine here oh didn't mean to order that right got her eventually it's just too fun man there's this just it's got to be the most fun ADC Build in the game nothing comes close you alone oh go ahead about her and we got them it's just so good against melee jumps as well especially the Champions like Olaf that can only run at you and have no instant Gap closer but even the ones with instant Gap closes like say Katarina we're talking about tanker then who doesn't just thank Katarina who doesn't just one shot you then they can like instant Gap closer onto you for sure but then you just walk away from them unless they have hearts you see like Renekton maybe but if they don't want to show you just Sprint away from them and there's nothing they can do to get close to you again nor can they escape from you got her all right let's get out of here I'll spend our gold we're not even on the draco's real where's the drama in that [Music] there's not much waiting for somebody we may as well just go straight to Inferno I'll just do the Raptors on the way there I guess last one oh try to predict the Juke there oh God no I'm fine oh hello what the hell thankfully I'm tanking of the Survivor for the clientele why not what does she even come from was she disguised again or does she come from out of vision oh I was about to Port shut me I should not thank that all right GG all right Gamers we are back gonna start off with some cheese on the several who's trying to tease me not gonna happen I'm not gonna let you get away with that we'll pop goes here we can actually try and get more out of this we got teams backing us up he's gonna flash through we're gonna follow nice even if it healed we still call him with the fourth shot a few years ago I guess it was actually alone there huh kind of awkward for him miss that I actually don't have the retreat which gives me enough time to base and get a long sword Ezreal is already going to be down a potion as well anyway this game we're going to be playing Jin Pantheon into twitch Ezreal this looks like a really good match across actually this looks really painful for twitch his aggression is going to be very limited before he just gets one shot by Pantheon flash w ow probably gonna want the room a lot to switch oh and we've got how are we getting so many just early surrenders and remix man God damn it GG all right Gamers we are back I probably should have level W here in my bed oh God all good we are back for another game of gentle diamond this game I'm going to be playing John Cena into brand Jinx kind of trading alone here there we go we got the fourth shots so Jinx does not want to trade that single like my auto my fourth shot does double the damage World attack does the last thing she wants to do there is Trade One Auto for One Auto we'll pop goes here because uh yeah either brand flashes or he's gonna be in a lot of trouble and we're still on the fourth shot at least so we get some damage off of it too not just forcing his Flash can maybe get Jinx here they don't have brand Q so nice yeah so I couldn't get hit by the brand W there but I'm not gonna ever die so okay I think Jinx is basically we want to try and crash this fast instead of going for the usuals two waves slow push into third wave crash sorry just maximize the amount of function misses uh I suppose we can also just stay here no point facing on this amount of gold that's why I usually want to crash on the third wave remember the second Because unless you get a kill there's just uh nothing to buy at this stage also not gonna be able to crash the third wave here though so we're gonna be just laning until probably double long sword we already have a farm lead over Jinx though like a pretty big one so despite not having kills at some point we'd like to base and spend this gold Advantage we have misclicked they stop me nice one you can squeeze in One auto there off of that w and she might die here oh I don't want a flash for it okay next one I was afraid that if I flashed to try and force your Jinx there I would kill her for sure but I would also maybe take a tour shot after which I'd Die there we go that time since it's just Jinx alone I know nobody else can finish me off after getting hit by the third shot so it's extremely worth it I should have killed they're actually not broad shot but well uh we can get this plating and then leave there we go now I'm out of here I don't even want to stick around for whatever's going on here I do not have the HP to be trying to help I just want to base and spend my gold I guess we'll just go for the Noom quiver here and we'll guess with these on next base probably every element must be in place oh damn that's rough very scary when I shoot this word over here the world will run out soon anyway that's probably gonna be useless very unlikely we get ganked from there without seeing any seeing a throne of the other Vision we have damn it oh okay my kid did go off in time okay I've got ghost up again by the way oh Brenda's here though nice oh what how did that hit me what I thought I dodge them what are you that's rough a lot of damage there it's barely managed to avoid that oh hello Kane I need to avoid slipping onto those traps Jesus that could have been a really bad gank for us if I hadn't chosen to place a word in there because I wanted to go aggressive on them um damn it I thought they would try and punish the harder my bad okay Brenda's walking for us for no reason oh hello Kane my bad I should have foreshowed him he should be killable here easily though anyway there we go ziggs might be on the way hello damn it he's already here I'm probably dead now damn it no if it does that I would have killed him maybe oh well uh we can pick up this with these hopefully my team does something here yeah I could have wasted a lot more of a ziggas time there if he hadn't just immediately already been here the moment to place that trap the idea was that I would see if he was coming leave the wave leave the whip leave the whip I would see if he was coming and then I could just Retreat instead it was just immediately enriched already start hitting me with Autos with cues with w there was no time to stall at all nowhere to like hide into Vision so I could actually fight back a study had the first Advantage while I was already lower HP to begin with as well oh God I should have brought this gun in there nice just not what is she doing with those traps those don't do anything to me can I did a lot of damage there okay I guess I I forgot to mention in the previous game where I talked about getting a free ultimate hit with your W it actually does depend on uh the points interview as well that you have because the you get more root duration that one was actually potentially missable it was just easier to lend things to the root if I'm aimed it like slightly wrong though she would have had a chance to move out of the way and if she'd been further away she also would have had more time to move I suppose a Max rank Max rank of w even if they are really far away from the ultimate they probably still do get a free hit just depends on how many points in W you have two you will learn what the beauty truly is out there son is the one that should be pressuring better on the turret here but she's not doing much they got a shovel on my wave and base especially if the next wave is a cannon wave it is perfect timing alright so I would have just waited until the next wave was gonna live it's the best at the base another reason to wait oh um a good old soon but yeah that brand would block some shots we'll just base and rush into Lane ASAP so hopefully we can prevent them crashing that wave this performance needs more okay and if they're not crushing the Swift then basically we both have we're basing on like on the same wave in the same wave state but we're still advantaged because we got the base first we're gonna miss miss farmer we're gonna get prior when we get into Lane here ah me it's gonna be if you're playing for me Han Solo putting up that maybe we can do something to Brent here hello oh I just barely didn't get the kill for myself come on get the pop goes just in case oh I didn't get the killer you're kidding me ah that sucks would have been so much better on me than Zach anyway but I will that's fine that I won't be able to use ghost to try and kill Jinx now but my thought process there for ghost was that it meant that I would be able to run down ziggs no matter what even if he managed to dodge every skill shot we would still get him with ghost before that to work we need to do it before he starts dodging every skill shot potentially if we wait until he's dodged it all then we no longer have time to chase him down we need to do it ASAP before we evaluate whether he actually does manage to apply or not but I thought there would be guaranteed value in that I would be able to just walk up to him and get the last set only he got burst down so hard by Zach probably just base now anyway I don't have alt without so suppressor with suppose we could dive though of sun actually doesn't do much yeah there's nothing to do here okay I guess I can just basically kind of wave then so next we have a kind of wave I could use either Wave car now but I'd rather just save it for Q because Q actually does a lot more with Claire now wow um next wave was a kind of way but we're staying for now  six is here already I want to try and cover the Zach there now I need to retreat Kane is mid nice one okay cool huh we actually don't have to shove in this wave because Zach was thanking her for so long that it delayed uh it allowed Arthur our whip to go under turret which actually creates the slopers towards us which is so nice and my record doesn't get canceled perfect now to crash this you have to shove it yet another wave here I just missed minimal form despite not having best on the cannon with problem is though now I need to be soaking up the Swift on the turret so I can't really go to to uh contest this streak that would be a lot of fun to give up okay I can brought it now oh we just go on Jinx I guess she's overstepped here nice one see her looking at me with malicious intent oh dude that was a Mystic I meant to press teeth that's where I have attacked for panto oh that's awkward friend should be dead here oh she got the kill I think she died for it oh well Star King coming for me I hope not be is terrible for comedy just pushed me out of the comet okay jinx um I'll do zeal s [Music] so we currently have four two five movement speed without any who's been amplifiers from like phantom dancer passive or my passive when I quit it's really nice Bob goes here so we can just run her down her best shot was trying to run into the turret but she was probably screwed either way nice one damn it I'm gonna have to use a Reload for this damn it uh I might as well stick around for lifting more gold maybe we can just get the rump now hopefully I can time my first shot to secure the last set but we can just block the Jinx w ow gotta run from Kendo oh God damn it we flash away before you can ultimate okay at least I live well we didn't actually Farm 50 gold but we waited until we had 50 gold we wasted time until we had 50 gold awesome I guess we can just go on Jinx here but perfect all right let's get out of here Kingdom after blascon by having to knock himself up in the process funny start the music I will make them dance oh the skin is zero and seven maybe I didn't need to flush away from them I just noticed okay didn't get the Kalan ziggs but we do just do a ton of damage onto brand this I think I can just get the start down nice one only to the other direction yeah I should record it on Jinx now I think I have blue trinket and W to cancel our base she won't get away with this canceled oh she might actually win that we need to back off after this fourth shot just kite her out until we actually have all the attacks available again there we go now for that heel we would have killed her with the fourth shot instead we have to play smart yeah on the dagger I just saw this motorcycle like two others in 0.5 seconds I can do Raptors while I'm waiting for a million whip to come into me happiness all right oh no no no damn it sinks might be greeting towards mid here yep Gooding or puffing oh we almost made a pasta traps hang on we got more speed from this so she's still dead eventually probably oh okay I'm probably dead here I don't have enough room to cut around here I don't think yep that sucks unfortunate for America to be there I never had Vision on him that I noticed there's nowhere here that I can see we see the ziggs but we don't care about ziggs didn't see him anywhere there he's oh he just randomly popped up right before I used our I know that where it came from though he must have like not appeared on Vision through here and just passed like all the way through mid like that kind of awkward and we didn't see that  happens [Music] I think Kane is gonna be going for a golems and then for our red buff should be easy enough to kill him oh especially with that HP let's pop goes if we can make it come on ah he's gonna escape with this blast cone that sucks maybe rice can get him but I still got ghost active for now oh he's just waiting for the pink never mind now we can get the red buff thank you Kane this would be easier come on down the sweater because it just got two big shutdowns back to back 850 on me then 900 on Zach you're as pissed about that he actually showed up as a lead over her now when he was losing Lin before he only died once tour though so when she can't complain too much even as a CS lead over her would be risky the gank marekaza because he can always just hold me again it wouldn't be in quite such a bad spot this time but we can avoid them getting into milorange of us oh hello come on ah he's the one I really want to hit hello jinx ah damn it I should have flashed away the moment I had uh ziggs lost my bud yeah it was a little bit overextended here wasn't I anyway that's one Jinx dies too also quite overextended do you if you have a jinx here you definitely can't afford to be farming in the middle of the wave because look at how much map control we got the turret here we got the turret no we don't have the turret there but we have the turret here we have the turret here they have like very limited control over the map because we have still Alvarado turrets so we can afford to push really far into their jungle uh I think I'll actually do bloodthirster here foreign have to wait for these medium whips to be pushed into you here where you can safely Farm them you can't be venturing out into the middle of the map where the enemies know they can safely Venture without ever running into trouble and there's no no nearby turret forgings to retreat into either I'm just gonna get this wave then we help with the trick it's the whole way of that yeah we'll do bloodthirster here because their comp is actually very damage focused I think so uh getting more survivability in the form of blood tester will be better for winning this game that's just getting extra damage from infinity edge last one oh and we got Cloud Soul now I'm gonna move really fast damn it okay we're getting flanked look at the moment speed nice one oh a relationship avoid that I think I might be dead now maybe I need to hit him no I needed to hit him well if I'd hit him I would have just healed off of a flip forward and I would have lived you see what I mean like we could have killed Brent slightly sooner but it doesn't necessarily mean we wouldn't have gotten gotten hit by the same amount of damage a lot of times where we're heading the opponents we're also going to be getting hit back because of the nature of their Champions Kane can easily like run one shot me when they're whenever I'm not attack range of them ziggs is ranged he can hit me back Jinx his wrench she can hit me back brand this range they can hit me back individually maybe a lot of those wouldn't matter so much but when you add them all together I'm just gonna be taking a lot of damage while I'm going aggressive so we want to use blood pressure to just maintain a rich people are high at all times so we can continue going aggressive instead of dropping that down to low HP and having to play safe that's very nice for James this you just got two thirds there or I assume she got the other bottling through it nice Jinx just got a lot of gold for herself that's really good for her not for us so much this place uh trapped there so we have Vision there and a trap here okay there top side oh okay he got hit by the trap at least hello ghost here he's gonna hold me hopefully that shot hit him it should be dead there oh apparently not this time we flash instantly ah damn it and we're just caught into a corner oh damn it okay at least my team gets a free burn off of it they have to chase me so far to kill me there man it wasn't necessarily smart to do even if it was a well I say free kill not exactly free if you give up a baron for it easily worth it for us also the drones blade so we can finish the split just a little bit faster we'll refund it if we happen to end up about 180 gold from objectives but I doubt it maybe with the sphere of getting this turret I'm not sure how much Global code you get it's like 100 right actually maybe I can oh it only gives like 50 what I don't think it's worth waiting 50 gold or 40 gold whatever it was could have picked up some pinks here actually but too late damn it yes nice one four that's is that Oliver burn Buffs then it is that's a big waste okay not bad nice fresh at least I'll get an inhib thanks to the efforts my teammates made with their Baron Buffs it's not completely wasted nope I need to focus came here because he's the one that would dive on me oh no no I'm dead now oh mate my floats are just disappeared the hell ah that sucks I just stepped far too forwards onto mordekaiser um would be nice to get qss but we're not gonna have room for it definitely play that poorly I think I could have killed Kane yeah here brand has already done all this burst Kane is the only one that can actually just keep on going on to it so we need to focus him even if we have the option of going on to brand orcane but I couldn't have killed Kane no I should I just should have made a mistake just over standing here onto the mordekaiser e range I could have kept on trying to cut Mordecai though I think I can actually kite so long as I play I run my um fire Cannon only Auto attacking during Falcon approx I could definitely kite mordekaiser without getting into his ultimate range that's what I should have been focusing on I didn't have a falcon and proc there and that's why I got punished even without getting altered he just sent me with the e all right nice one might be able to just hope everyone killed them all yep we'll pop goes here and we'll kill zix absolutely free killer soon here we go I shouldn't have wasted my full shot but it doesn't matter too much there we go I'm just done now in the end I mean we would have had probably the same exact same account whether we might plot this or Infinity Edge we didn't get to properly test out the theory because every time I really got into action I just got by Mordecai's World anyway whether I go blood test or Infinity Edge I'm always going to get screwed by emotic as wrote to my credit though I'd never ended up dying to anything that wasn't what a casualta think so maybe the blood tests are working that were good Gigi all right Gamers we are back for another game of ginth diamond enemy team gonna be starting off with an in bed looks like we'll all be okay here gonna be running Cleanse This Game mainly because of the nasus so oh hello I was scratching my head I thought they were done with her indeed oh God hello thank you Jesus what the hell is he chasing for okay NASA says Flash no longer got him hopefully I live here oh no well that's just unfortunate okay we got another kill no assist for me though oh no Scott is going to clean up here she's way more DPS than anybody else left in that fight this is the quite unfortunate part of uh wait didn't that that's a steeping back or nice just returned I guess oh that is rough a triple kill for Kaiser starting off the lane unfortunately we focused a lot of people throughout the fight but Kaiser was never the one out of position so she just ends up High HP when everybody else is low and she just gets to clean up that fight suddenly um yeah I don't I don't think I should have done that in hindsight I thought I would just be able to escape didn't quite turn that away that's a bad trade for Kaiser hasn't had a chance to spend her gold yet mind so she should not be trying to go aggressive she should be trying to base and I should be trying to prevent that bass by freezing this it's kind of risky though okay nice at least I can make her base a little bit worse ideally I would like her to get baited into staying so hopefully we can get that shot down before she even has a chance to spend the cold she won't do that though but in the meantime this means I get a lot of time to just regen HP while I'm sitting on the sprees no poet's words yeah so she missed more than an entire way for that freeze that's really nice that was worth giving up off my HP for since crashing that the maker Miss from that way was obviously not gonna be an option there with my early wave clear thank you they were deaths they will die and thought of them because the tread water right as a minion died and I mix my auto bug out for some reason even though I never ordered I mean to hit Chrysler there okay I should probably base her says too much of a item Advantage at the moment I would own a way for all of our HP here we can just try and get into Lane faster to miss less Farm in the meantime RHP regen will do a lot oh damn she could type there was she low as well oh yeah she was she should have based as well that is extremely greedy of her what the hell should have been with the basement but I didn't notice yeah that sucks you should she shouldn't have gained an advantage there basically what should have happened here is that I ended up with a small CS lead thanks to my freeze I lost some more sales under turret there but at the very least overall it wouldn't have made up for how much sass she missed when I froze the wave but instead of getting out of there with like a small closing of the Gap she just ends up getting a bigger even biggerly just because Lulu died that's very annoying um there's not much Point basing hopefully she's not just flanking us nope probably should afford Chrysler there though would rather prototype poking her while she slowed what the hell so I do anyway there's gonna be a rough matchup overall given that we're already behind and the fact that Lulu has no Synergy with Jin whatsoever ideally we'd like have to have some engage to deal with this bot Lane but instead we don't really have a response for vocals it could be poking us from a sort of a wrench and a reward for managing to close the gap onto him as we get Dunked On by Kaiser who's already got a massive lead so I'm forcing a very roughly any phase where hopefully we just end up getting carried by our team if we manage to survive this Lane without giving up too much more of a lead find Our God you're uh what are these around one natural line opponent I guess it might have been from the level one I'm not sure can just get a free W on her there free poke keeping a piston out of root I'd rather save my cues actually for guys I don't want to cue vocals there perfect because we saved the queue for Kai since when you had the chance makes it such a better trade on to Kaiser I just realized that I don't want to waste Mana just trading on the belkas when that damage won't be too irrelevant because we can't engage onto him anyway foreign who actually has to be in our range to deal damage oh damn it need to flash away I'm probably dead though sad okay at least we get the one for one on volcas well we should be fine here if she just doesn't try to trade back because this never results in a good outcome for us but I wouldn't risk it guys I could probably just get yep okay at least there's a one for one but that gives nothing to me so that's really unideal because Kaiser just gets 300 more gold Wars to carry although at least it was a shutdown honestly even though it was that it was a shutdown that actually is worth it I would say even if there's just gold for Lulu and not for any of our carries yeah I should get some Mythic off of that not bad at least we're not behind on Farm strings yeah I should have just flashed them all cause knockout but I was hoping my fourth shot movement speed would be enough to get out of there but no such luck and it was a good response from Kaiser to then flash onto me while I was knocked up and pressed me down while I couldn't flush away got a lot more speed now makes it easier to dodge the vocal skill shots should have tried the W here they're actually in the ultra if it landed the lowest speed we can gather the easier the lane becomes okay now shot Mr Q okay we'll just walk away she just waste her ultimate not bad ah damn it I was about to use old okay here we go I was about to use wool oh what I just clicked teeth my bad what I just accidentally attacked move while I was throwing our shots what twice today in this video that have uh had a mishap with my orange tea usually it doesn't happen to me despite the close placements but still we've actually managed to start getting an advantage now maybe this thing's still a little having the Mythic or maybe it's because I actually have items now kaisa could have vodkas there but I would probably involve missing the cannon which would rather not risk given it wouldn't be kill on him just potentially sitting up with kill later but not guaranteed now that's really good though this mini block I can't get onto them okay we want to play some Vision we don't want to um immediately die now that we finally have a lid yeah I might die here because I didn't fully back off there oh I'm so lucky nice one based off of vodka's movements it really made me hesitate I felt like nasus or rather hacker I'm sorry it might have been in the area I don't know how close that recall is to finishing but let's cancel it oh this is so awkward we want to go aggressive but we know hecarim is in the area okay our jungler is now coming outside let's eat that to that so close now he is holy and we canceled the Kaiser base again I don't have Mana to do it again with W though okay herkim is here we know he has an old nice we're just beating Kaizen to staying or more specifically this time hecarim did if I can get a level up I would have a manifold nice one I just want to keep canceling it in fact if Lilia could show up here we could easily dive okay I don't have time to type to her that I'm trying to communicate this to her foreign holy crap that was such a long shot I was hoping because he was moving around the center just slightly standing behind Balcones there was a chance he would slightly peek out and I tried to time it just right just barely manage that holy crap a little bit lucky but also fairly decent play all right let's uh crash this now Lilia comes God damn now she can tax my wave it's all good though we got the crash perfect oh we're in such a better spot now no worries Lulu oh not girl for us to have it I need to drop oh got her kill does not go to me though but okay well no kills for me there but still a really good fight they've completely lost control over the lane now we actually officially have the lead I just be threatened in here I could afford to go really aggressive there because that cleanse so if I got hit but let's kill wasn't the end of the world but suddenly not able to kill hot crumb God damn it okay she didn't even clear my wart with we should probably do this nice wall and I got it we want to go on Kaiser here hecarim is trapped here oh what my team is retreating I think we should kept fighting there okay nice one still goes to me we're gonna Focus guys here in the vocal sorry uh badly angled ultimate we'll throw one shot then just leave we'll flash over this wall ah damn it okay she goes down this fourth drop in the last of them because there we go nasus is here we have W or cleanse if we want to get rid of his w we should be able to get him here the team pull this up I can bait if you want to spam to cleanses w we still want to delay SW actually getting on me though if possible yeah it's dead here perfect and Lily lives too that's so huge Lux is no Mana she's not a threat well not much of a thread suppose you could QR if she has are up but I imagine it's down either way I got cleanse which is no threat to me I should be able to get Phantom dancing now when I base okay we won't bother I think that turret we just want to base spend our gold holy crap I can't believe we actually got a lid over the sky suddenly after how that started this actually did become I did not really account for how uh while Lulu apparently skills in this Lane because she eventually just made it so it takes very little damage with those Shields I could actually afford to go really aggressive while we were still behind and not take too much damage so long as they Dodge the vocal skill shots that was a big Turning Point especially especially we probably hit that point sooner than we should have because of Kaiser making the dive where Lulu got like 800 gold or whatever it was top side ow come on oh I missed the counter for that damn okay they're pretty low back them into a corner here yep that's fine did a lot of damage with that alt it doesn't need to kill anybody to be useful you see that here yes now Kaiser might die as well we need to use four seven on the turf for some movement speed come on come on she's dead if she doesn't appeal there we go um yeah let's just path around just in case I don't expect to get collapse done but I don't have full information here okay now I do they're all mid oh what's going on there I think we gotta start on base hopefully they shouldn't be able to get this turret if I don't base immediately oh we won't actually flank I think We're not gonna get home guards if we base anyway so we may as well a person from behind where hopefully isn't coming with me then I can't flank I could maybe get hack from oh got him nice one that was very let's see in a second maybe a hecarim might be almost to walk into me but I wasn't expecting it to happen I got cleanse here so I can afford the risk running into nessus probably wouldn't kill him it would probably be with the cleanse but at least they get here a lot faster than pathing around hopefully we got this turret oh yeah that should be easily doable with the 6w oh no he did it too early can we win that trade with just one Auto oh it's good oh well that was an extremely unnecessary death I don't see how I didn't see how it happened but I know that it should have been able to retreat based off the last time I saw him I can base here that's the kind of whiff it'll take a while to die think we can just go ahead and do farcon here definitely a game where we do infinite edge third though instead of uh fourth sorry instead of bloodthirster though because we got the mostly free head the necess in the hecarim there's not much free hitting happened in the previous game I'll just pull it into the brush where they don't have vision ah dude something massively chunk that must maybe the Luxy massively drunk there right before the luxel tit yeah oh I might need to deal with this nasus blue trinket just to make sure we're not face checking into someone trapping here for the same reason you might know that I'm here oh God foreign if I'd known I would have cleansed it in advance so I could uh play more aggressively there but in hindsight it worked out just the same as if I hadn't as I've had sorry what else was around hopefully not high Chrome anybody else I can just run from oh God he's so fast man God damn oh well Jesus the felt like it was coming at me with humans as well actually he had a huge movement speed boost before he even hit me with face Rush I didn't realize how to fully followed though maybe going for an earlier bloodthirster would have been better but I don't want to do it over infinity edge so basically I'm thinking I should have maybe done Infinity Edge third so I could do bloodthirster fourth now because I want to do Infinity Edge before bloodthirster I'm gonna be able to only build blood tester as final item at the earliest six needs to stop dying for no reason I don't know why he ever should have been there thank you enemy has been slain hello eventually I'll catcher maybe I can still get her foreign last one thank you Lola for thinking this at least I think much less Terror damage okay he should have gone on me this is a huge up he'll look he will kill a little but then he'll die to me hopefully there we go got him easily well this guy's a solo she's retreating here what where is she oh I have the last shot cutter Jesus when I had no idea where she was what I don't know how the first shot didn't get Vision over then weird damn uh Drake is up in 30 seconds I really want to spend my goal do I have Infinity Touch I don't I could get scuttle either that or I solder and split I would rather get scuttled but at the same time I'm wasting time where the trick is spawning underneath the base Ace up no I need this I've already committed to taking scuttle instead of selling guns blade so I have to finish it 50 cancel my base there that would have been so terrible Lulu should not be pup we may just be giving up the trick yeah everybody's top side we have to give it up that's sad maybe we can asses here at least keep it in Minion so I can move a speed and we can hit the ward too damn I said we could try it honestly it might work out what is up with the six we don't have time now all right so maybe we're doing this pretty fast actually maybe we don't even give up the end head but we will give up the inhabit if we rush this down this is so risky about the enemies actually see this coming locks just helped us finish this in time though now we can base oh wow they really want to force this let's get into a safer spot that I don't even need to flush unless ah all this vision okay we got him nice one Lulu get off Clans we want to run from nasas okay he's wasted his W might be fun now should be fine I think he almost died there up hopefully I survive here the shovel did she only just throw out e or was it already there I guess she must have only exploded the D I never saw her throw the E only her w or did she did she throw it at the same time is there w ow [Music] yeah she must have yeah it was described by her W okay but if I just aimed all the shots at her anyway I might have actually killed her before she could kill me or try the one for one still this was not too bad though okay we sell this we got I'd rather actually get quick look it's very important for our Mobility to just always quit so at least this puts us at 95 it's very unlikely we don't quit now laughs that brought you out the one thing there did we get cancer here though she's dead she knows it two shots man um okay we cleanse that maybe we got locks here now another committed cleanse to this yep good that was overall very risky but paid off let's wait for a wave though it's inconvenient help first one I don't have cleanse for this all good got him we get hekram we should be able to nice one lolo we're gonna stay in Branch but oh no wait oh dude I keep missing orders okay oh me my bad I played that so bad I kept the Miss clicking castle one point I lost a lot of DPS from that also be able to actually get a stand range of the hecarim while also trying to cut him and make sure I wasn't in Q auto range okay not bad though with bloodthirster this will now become a lot easier to do as well I won't be quite so low every time I make a slight up oh bold do with getting the streak for sure this wave to kill it faster don't care too much about the Lost heads oh I just killed two customers though we got some XP there too got a little over 16. okay we have a jungler with us just might I'll also save my fourth shot for this got it holy crap that was a close one though I didn't time that perfect I don't think this is a little bit risky to go for ddw wasn't me was it no whoever he did he was trolling you can only use WME okay we did a lot of damage done with that okay Baron is up in 45. can I get Lux here oh dude what the hell how did that reach so far okay she did later combo far too much though fun this is really bad for them really bad if I don't get hit by luxury here hang on oh didn't need to cleanse my butt holy Quadra let's go we should be able to end off of that I could just tell in advance like 10 seconds in advance that I was going to chase them to the death not even hecarim can escape me man like not even hacking with phase Rush it's just brutal let's keep messing up his stuffy it's kind of funny all right GG all right Gamers we are back for another game of gent the diamond gonna be playing John Swain a really good bot Lane and two Misfortune Leona get everyone in Clan since it's pretty mandatory against Leona could be starting off trying to cheese getting me balling as they get into Lane we're gonna want to use the Swaney on Misfortune and if it lands then I actually I think I'll level w ow follow it up okay they're actually not going to sound in a good spot for us to do that so with this lovely queue and let off the truck because I'd rather not miss three Millies just to probably not actually get the cheese off off because she's gonna go for this last head so we walk up to her and again I probably should have used that foreign actually she would have been in range I guess we're playing against Rengar and he started blue for some reason so he's not gonna be ganking us for a while we know the enemy ball Unleashed or at least it's very likely we got Misfortune here can't quite finish her off but we did a decent amount of damage there okay nice I need to really plan ahead with the Cannons you can't just uh Plus at them really short notice if you're uh last setting something before it should have deleted her actually okay nice um okay we're gonna level Q here since we obviously don't have Mana for Q and E on top of w Ane just needs to be playing way more aggressively by the way at this point he has more HP than me and is still standing behind me at this point uh they definitely have to be playing oh he's not even level three yet though oh hang on I'm probably dead here oh is she that too nice yes we'll just waste a bunch of Ringo's time there we go does this guy left he does still is ignite he could like he could actually silica on it there but oh well can we get this get the boots okay potion how did we think again wait no he has blue how what did they actually not leash leave this way leave this way I should have picked this sooner it looked very tempted to keep my wave there he did start red huh I'm confused because it really looked like they had uh just leashed my bad I just chose to create my own nice when I should get the caster and also him his fortune with that I shouldn't really need to place award and try definitely don't wanna restaurant the freezer too far up in the lane in case I get engaged on by Leona but it freeze here just to keep the waste that in a bad spot for Misfortune is definitely smart even if she won't get ganked as punishment at least we made her missed some Farm since she was scared to walk up okay now we have no vision over here might as well place a wooden try and also try and shove this wave out so we can place even more vision oh that's Wayne Blanchard really far out um right so my idea was to show first and then Place vision oh my God I actually just barely love her I'm gonna recover HP very slowly though yeah that's like so you want to shove out the wave then Place Vision man because otherwise they get prior you'd rather get prior and then Place Vision so you get both parallel and also some Vision Best of Both Worlds it's very unlikely that after we had just been ganked by Rengar that we would be getting ganked again within the next 20 seconds that it takes us to shavat the wave so there was no point in leaving the lane and leaving me 1v2 just to go place a ward that wasn't going to be immediately necessary well my bad for not noticing I'm leaving though at some point I'm just gonna have to base here since there's no recovering from that trade whoa I could have had that cluster okay then I think I can base here let's hope so special of Misfortune doesn't realize that I'm basing here and just doesn't push this fast enough nice so she's very distracted right now she's not shoving hopefully she doesn't randomly kill Swain there with Luna's help uh can I wait for a push I may as well I'm waiting for so much pain away I'm starting to shop now though they shoved their overall pretty fast but it should arrive there in time for I hope most of that maybe even the cannon if I'm lucky with my w maybe not I think I'm just barely not gonna be in time yeah sadly I think with that awkward amount of HP I wouldn't have hit it anyway though or I mean I would have hit it obviously but I wouldn't not have lost it okay I want to try and interrupt Miss Fortune's best perfect okay I'll use my ultimate to shove out this way faster now that I've interrupted the base she's definitely Never Gonna Reach This wave in time the last hit it the costs are more fun by going up the Consular base than I did uh then I cost Myself by venturing out to do it since most of the Cs that was under third I was gonna miss anyway ideally Swain would have stayed in Lane so we could actually pressure kill on her and he could do that while I was uh nothing away myself but since he left we just have to do it ourselves now we can shove this wave out and then Place forward to not before Swain there we go running out of man enough suddenly but we'll do what we can with what we have wanna definitely get rid of that and I'll place just a round of trap in the middle of the river as well so I can see if Gringo's coming from there I think that should give me vision gonna have to play on the back foot though currently Leon is level six Misfortune should be six soon I am six but I don't have Ulta and either way it's not good in melee fights or close range fights and Swain is level four so now hitting six for quite a while so we're gonna have to play on the back foot at least we got a 30 well not quite 30 but decent yes leave the room is Fortune about 24-25 even more once I get this wave didn't want to rescue him for the queue as well there are since Leona would be moving into range my theater is the mind a good trench off this way about okay if Misfortune is not really in position here and we got Kane around so I wasn't really interested in full running away let's try and get them as Fortune here that's a Chase gank bring us on the way as well oh man okay that's a lot of people just together and grow though or just to get Swain did that Wrangler just splash I believe he did nearly got w ow but I can't reach my fortune first so we're gonna have to go for Rengar let's give me the kill huge I don't have any matter right now oh my God we keep baiting flashes okay I have to flush that one Jesus I can maybe call this Chase no way how did that not kill that hit him what I was gonna say he might be in that brush but I should have been moving into position oh okay nice and I got the assist we want to go into Misfortune here okay can't finish her off sadly but Leona was definitely not gonna die there was Misfortune was positioning to try and kill syndra so we either have to kill Misfortune for trying to kill syndra or forcer a set of lessons with I or what was I saying uh this cost me a cannon man I just saved their life yeah we got a misfortune there so either she dies while she's trying to go on syndra and possibly dies before she even finishes off syndrome or uh what's the alternative or Misfortune just straight up has to back off because she sees me approaching her and therefore is not able to finish off syndra either way it's it's a good outcome prevents a bad one at the very least that looks in trouble oh my God that damage though he almost took them ringer if only had adult okay nice one syndra this Center is actually very strong okay we got 40 seconds left on ours are on our cleanse we probably don't want to be playing walking up too aggressively though second Dodger pretty easily but mainly when I got played Four cup otherwise it won't overextend to even perform oh okay we got Clans up in nine well that was that was way too far away for that to matter man okay idea Liliana would have been large P when I did that so it would actually deal damage to her when she blocked the shots uh what the was that curve bring them up here around Leon is posturing real aggressively without having looked up which is suspicious yeah there's Rengar pretty far away though might have been unrelated to Leona's movements still feel like ring is going to be around is around that list that's how I was about to place my word there we could try and do this trick um here we got Sandra on the way oh she's two kills for me recalls for me my Lord let's go that's Gigi that was one one and one no sorry one one and two then four one and three or something like that this is good behind every mask is another mask started off looking like a risky fight to think I didn't feel like I could position anywhere to deal damage but then we're gonna just randomly overextended go blown up by syndra and it's just free like uh smooth sailing from there oh damn it I don't have a manifold even if I had it up all the space and spend my gold match misfortunes items they might have Vision here no okay follow your nose walking towards me whoa that's a hard steel Vlad that is not good I'm pretty sure at least I'll look at this win rate just uh fact check myself but pretty sure it's terrible yep 40 One Rate ten percent lower than AP Vlad not viable in the slightest so vlad's passive is that he converts AP into HP and HP into AP which makes it sound like HP should be a decent stat on him and it is like it's it's nice to pick up a HP alongside your AP items to get a little bit more AP in the process but the conversion ratio from AP to HP is much much greater than the conversion ratio from HP to AP especially given vlad's AP scalings you would much rather build some AP or like full AP and just have some HP alongside it then to build full HP and just end up with pitiful AP and be completely ignorable oh hello you can't safely fight here given the turret let's focus was Fortune here um damn it oh why is that or bring her here too now damn it that sucks what could have done better there maybe turn on Misfortune sooner it was a pretty situation to begin with though I could have definitely turned onto Vlad sooner here I didn't notice them both flashing through the wall then I saw Leona flashing through the wall and I was like nope can't walk there yeah but I sort of definitely turned Misfortune sooner for sure once I saw her walking up past the turret on that HP she's easily restable and it will abuse that and get her out of the fight sooner okay nice one I can't really color there I won't bother using old because it might better to recall when actually if I keep her in Lane keep her desperately at these minions you might actually make a mistake that's actually killable like here she is very clearly greeting oh but if I'd hit that hang on it's gonna have to be revealed better shut the stepper on the swing W so that was just really easy to aim this art is a compulsion first dude that hit though that was just kind of lucky that she didn't dodge them without those that could not have happened should place a trap there and it's like I said like I could have used my ultimate the Chevrolet Lane sooner special if I landed everything but if I did that she would have been so low because obviously I wasn't going to kill her with that it would would have just been about harassing her uh she would have ended up so low that she would realize oh I'm killable here let's recall instead she just grades trying to get that farm I think she even tried to trade with me for some reason even though she was really down in items and then we just kill her off of that in Hilo though where I know The Misfortune wouldn't make that mistake I actually would have just gone for the harassle serving her out of Lane isn't like necessarily the big greatest album you can get if you're trying to carry a game but it would probably be the best outcome I could hope to get in that situation in Hilo but in Loyola you can count on your opponents making mistakes like that and you just have to play around that you know people ask me like how do I carry when my teammates are just doing the most obscenely dumb you know like the enemies are doing the same just punish it if you can punish the enemy's mistakes you will carry that's how you carry should have killed sooner but whatever oh good got him but not the kill let's get out of here okay so there's not full if uh each or tank Vladimir at least he just really want some HP considering he's got two stacking HP mechanics grasp and hard Steel my work asks questions let's get this red buff on the way to Drake and if we if there happens to be a fight then we just ignore the red buff yeah it's we're probably gonna need to go here just play it safe hope our team I guess we're focused Leona here because she's squishier and easier Optical blood doesn't completely ignorable now that he's got demonic but he's also not like I don't have to worry about getting one shot by him at least daughter just can't escape me now I'm gonna get this wave screw the red buff the moment we land one Arrow all the rest will follow you just get enriched for that one Auto 's unfortunate the grandpa is like even if you don't even crit that the very least you still get the Phantom that's removement speed and the flip movement speed which allows you to probably get in range for a second daughter and that second daughter has a pretty decent chance of critting at this stage of the game oh I almost saved her with that did I have a blood out on me oh no now I do we cut out his super suck might have to hold them sketchum here but I do have more room with speed so I'm fine you should have charged this either you should have ewed not just w ow then I would have maybe had to flash away I would have probably just limit tested it though since I don't think he has that much damage with that build he's going for well some EP now but even more HP mainly stuff Riley's is going for that's terrible this letter already has a lot of slows with the Z I need fire can I want to go aggressive there and I don't have it so let's recall for it kind of stick it out like a flower oh I was in a Range kind of awkward because now that W could have led to a Kill at least Leon is kind of low here so even if she blocks all the shots she'll take a lot of damage maybe even die ah missed the last one oh well oh right between all of them oh hello no way God damn it man my bad oh nice well a little bit better same as my flash forwards which is barely the Nicole Ranger 's up in a minute oh how do we get that in here that must have been Minions that got it nice one oh hello God how does that have that fully charged this one okay I had Q left as well if that didn't quit him and to finish him off uh uh I'll stick around until now that I got red buff I've got a lot of healing not to mention Fleet is healing a lot of camps at the moment as well my bad actually I can base now from penetouch the currently are leap is healing actually basically 200 per proc that is crazy actually 200 now more than it's just such an amazing source of sustain it's actually part of the reason why the shin play style is so viable as well as you get so much crazy healing from Fleet because you move so fast that you charge it really fast since it charges off of movement Northern ADC would have this charge so quickly except old Siri rest in peace I'd rather hit the Jason sees a squish here I got cleanse remember I don't have to be too afraid here okay we cleansed that yes oh man maybe I should have actually not cleansed it just let myself get engaged on by Leona then cleanse as soon as any sign of trouble starts this one and there's the surrender Gigi all right Gamers we are back for another game of ginta diamond like I think it's actually not invading I think he just wanted to place award yeah we can see at least some of his teammates up there so I'm gonna walk up to him they might actually try to vid now I don't know if they saw my team placing a word or not nope so they have a word there um that's not good he should have immediately flushed out no hesitation man be fine let's start the show gonna start off playing with a small disadvantage but oh they're actually gonna go for a red buff is she going alone I'll pop a potion here but she she needs a leash we can hopefully try and kill our hundred dollars to step forwards though here we go oh there we go actually if she was gonna be getting help I would not have bothered with this but uh yeah that's just two free Gonna Miss XP maybe sadly oh no actually did not miss XP holy crap Lucian made a big mistake just clearing those minions so fast if you hit the latest like the death of those three melees for a little bit longer then I would have missed XP there and we're definitely still going to be beaten to level two so gonna play on the defensive ran out no you don't want to hit the hook right as they're heading level two buddy I'll try and Rush this down for level two but that's just not happening yikes the desperation ignite what the oh no well usually he's gonna kill so we just walk up in front of him now uh oh I got it nice we got all of those level Q here since we're running low on Mana could actually make a call no we got him nice one good maybe not let's hook again soon ah no worries we'll shove this end this is already much better Arkham than I expected this guy just does not turn it off we want to base nobody yeah we'll just cut pickaxe and refillable here probably more ID than going double long sword I've still got the boots in the refillable okay solution might be in trouble here oh no no okay okay if I can if I can get a lane here in fact I think we could just immediately Island because I have such a big item Advantage Revolution right now but what I'm gonna try and do is just thin this out as hard as I can oh this might be the last thing they wanted to do actually yours just kite the pike a little bit or we got him okay we saved the Photoshop for a while there because I think I was only gonna be able to get one Auto off anyway might as well save my Photoshop when it does the maximum amount of damage I would have also queued before the fourth shot but I was worried I might lose vision the ring the um uh fourth don't know sorry during the queue and therefore not be able to land the fourth shot because Pike might get out of range role in this w so I just went for the fourth shot directly while I knew that vision for it ended up meaning that I maybe didn't get killed when I could have otherwise maybe got it if I had used the queue assuming I would have been able to land the fourth shot but I felt it was because one of my teammates was much more likely to be able to pick up that kill after my fourth shot than if I only killed I was also helping my Q itself would just or my full shot itself would just give me the kill but obviously I didn't time that right yeah Lucian just needed to try and get that shot faster he was not in a good spot there because we could just easily engage or at the very least well I'm in Pike engage there but I think we should have been able to find and engage at least if Nautilus was uh willing to be on the same page as me death is hurting but okay we'll just place the word there for now oh my God the past and solution now and uh once we shove this in then I want to go play some Vision some proper vision I wanna clear the blast another minimum if it's up it should be up by now I'm sure okay there we go it's down now could have actually run down run by down she could have got clubs down by side as well but it will place a trinket there uh I can use this yeah okay that's fine maybe we get them here holy crap.cc chain nice one I should have dubbed actually my bad before I had a chance to go through the wall there's not six here I might be able to land another sold this is the fourth shot early yeah there we go oh I've only had the what shot there oh well yep now we can actually do this streak I was gonna say that I couldn't do the Drake because I needed to suck up that wave on the turret but they stupidly Engage The Fight even though we have the numbers advantage so we can just go aggressive on them there then shove the wave now we can do Drake and then base I might miss a way for that base but I don't want to greet too much trying to get a really good base but I could just base now and spend my gold oh we'll follow up with built because we're not really in range we have to wait come on come on we know Pike is somewhere there man God damn it I think people should have been chasing there guys guys oh my God I'm in so much trouble here what the hell man it's just ignoring everything okay at least it's a good trade for my team but I give over a huge shot down there and solution as well foreign once we start building towards zeal [Music] my talent justifies all actions oh missed God damn it holy the pike HP how is he so healthy now  me Jesus that was obscene what's the last HP we saw man I was thinking that I could leave him because he was on no HP anyway bro look at that oh my God he ended up coming up with more than half HP Jesus okay I should have just flashed on Pike to finish him off I didn't think he would be able to rejoin the fight so hopefully okay I feel about to get hooked up oh he didn't fear he should have immediately feared the Lucian oh man that was an easy coming start on maybe I can get a kill on Lucian here one thing I want to do is get version of this brush it's not there where is he no way what oh I thought it was actually gone okay I guess a mouth was just not giving me the vision that I thought it would I just once I did my first two shots I was convinced he was just like all the way over there or something and I was just throwing my third shot out of desperation I was so surprised when I actually hit him 700 gold shot down to me that is so good very important oh man we'll get alongside I don't think it's worth waiting just to sell my refillable or quick little quick look would be really nice but no worth waiting and also selling refillable for action isn't good enough oh no oh my God thank you [Music] I am a slave to this passion the minion weather's here so I'm not too worried unless holy crap my bad I should have been worried I didn't even get like cooked wait did I I just got a melee kid and it was still enough my bad I wasn't thinking about the EOS thinking about the minion the minion wave blocking his Q my bad I definitely could have avoided that it was just unexpected like if I just got it to the left I was just kind of panicking because I wasn't expecting it and again when I can't the base on nunch just keep barely not having enough every base not gonna be able to protect this turret but maybe we can clean them up we manage solution not the ghost perfect got him oh come on where is he here he is hopefully that here got him God bless double kill doesn't make up with the turret but it helps helps me feel better about it oh I think we might even got the first thread as well they just got mad while that was all going on uh but we don't even get platings here said everyone out just as we've rested the president means we might get the turret here no dude he got pulled back there what I'm so screwed here uh what is that slow oh dustblade oh man oh no  that sucks man okay at least I can finally get that correct look in the form of zeal I didn't I meant to drop the aggro I took so much turret damage there but that was a like a weird knockback volition had with uh the knowledge you look at this is because he got blocked by the turret and look at that bounce back God damn that is so weird and there's something to do with the tour but I don't know why it would make him do that I guess it's because he couldn't actually get pulled back as far as he should have been because the turret was in the way it doesn't pull him into the wall it just uh like kind of like forces him against it and so then when it when the Nautilus like slight bounce back happened it looked really extreme because it actually the bounce back distance is the same as it normally would have been and it just looks really extreme compared to what it really looked like because it's uh him being pulled against the wall that was restricted made a very misleading as to where he'd actually get bounced back to I'm kind of taking a big risk farming here alone when I don't have Vision my knowledge should not be leaving me alone here because I want to farm this but I can't do it safely but I'm just gonna take the risk because we're playing in Loyola I don't think like I mean there's a decent chance the enemies won't punish this yeah you can see the enemies just show up on midvision which lets me know that I'm safe to push here they should have been rushing bot to punish me shoving here and get a double kill Noobs well at least we tried to her for turret can't match the calls though okay if they go out of vision no they're not going out of vision we can keep pushing them because I obviously can't defend 1v3 even if I base and if I do base there's a lot of time that's also going to be spent on rotating which is not gonna be productive I just want to get that Cannon man where should they could be yeah collapsing on me now I don't know where they are I don't know where they went okay looks like I'm fine yeah they're all top side still finally I got the kind of just took forever man it's got no e is Gus fret breaker wait there we go he's gonna die here eventually come on horses need a flash because I lost Vision at the worst moment man oh well actually done double the damage of volusion with McCracken Slayer compared to his Kraken Slayer and we both finished at the same time it's for anybody who uh was in my previous video of Kraken Slayer gin saying but Jim doesn't get any Kraken Slayer frogs he's going to attack speed yeah but your crack and slur process double the damage of anybody else's well not yet but it will and even before it does it's still doing decent damage okay oh that was an awkward okay it was a really awkward timing for Nautilus to Walt because he could have waited for the windball to be over so it could actually follow it up that he forced me to pass around the wind wall which also put me a risk of getting Gasol did I should have just ignored it ah damn it oh he's already charging hook okay nice he should have this lotion should have kept on trying to finish me oh double kill perfect who could be coming from here why for sure is coming I just like should be actually damaging her you should be forcing her to have to turn on him that sucks I didn't seem out of golf so I couldn't kite my bad yeah Fire Sticks actually goes aggressive and why she probably she either has to like lose all of her HP or she decides well I can't ignore this and she has to go aggressive on him then once the cooldowns are up then I can actually go and buy as well especially starting off with my w to make sure she's rooted so I don't just get immediately altered I get some free damage before she can actually start fighting back I feel like I may as well do it definitely don't want to do blood test so the cop is actually quite tanky this time so we'll start off with that can probably just get away with not doing Lord Dominics as usual though and screams I bring both yeah so now my crack and slurpock is doing 80 more damage for proced than lotions is and because of my CH my whole chasing potential thing is it's actually very realistic that I can just get more cracking slower products than Lucian can just because I cannot attack people more than he can despite my lower attack speed when you think about it movement speed for gin is like attack speed for other Champions the faster you move the mod effects you get nice one wow we just got a free burn here this this is the worst place for that fight to happen for their team or for any for this is the worst place for any team to lose a fight because the enemy team literally has no choice but to do Baron there's no other logical Choice except to do Baron where's my right we do now let's go do Drake too Drake Drake like a lot of the time in this silo or well in Loyals in general well I've been doing these kind of series a lot of time I just struggled to get my team to do objectives like Baron after an ace like that because one person or two people will go off to the side and then the people that do want to follow the call they're like uh we don't have people coming should we even bother trying and then because they don't immediately move the bear and the people that went off to the side don't bother turning against their decision either but this time it happens literally in front of Baron nobody thought we should do anything except do Baron how convenient is that oh Dana's in trouble there probably just gonna go one shot [Music] he also is should have ghosted sooner come on God all right that was actually kind of a close one if I didn't crit right there I would have been I think I didn't quit there which could have also me oh man and he's dead minion screw them really hard there I mean he knew they were gonna screw him he just kept walking forwards with result anyway knowing that I wouldn't actually deal damage to me even if he canceled his old turlin just switch to water attacking me I'm sure I could attempt and tanked him long enough to then one shot him after as soon as Mario attacks were back up um can we go for the sinhub well they have to either defend against Mira have to defend against said I guess well else is already there I I was gonna say I guess what I'll just do is I'll just keep pushing there until become defend and then I go help top I didn't quit I needed a crit there if I had for it I wouldn't have been in range of his stride breaker okay at least I should live here unless does he have flush I guess not thank God Jesus last one okay all right and I'm out of here all right well no let's just keep pushing for now I guess I mean no the set is really low we should not be pushing but it might work out Beyond dead he says okay I got one Auto off before I died in one shot y'all so thank Lord well I mean I guess I might as well just do blood pressure next since I put the Basel enough for it that'll make me extremely hard to take down especially because I compare it immediately with the Zeal which already gives a lot of the benefits that far Canon would give just a little bit less attack speed for half the attack speed really and obviously the lack of ranged Auto but we get most of the movement speed that it would give us we're just like the 15 attack speed converted into movement Speed on crits and at this point since we're relatively sure that our next base no matter what will give us enough for fire Cannon we can just go for the Elixir as well since it's probably not a delay Park on and it's also not such a massive power Spike that we want to medley base for at the moment we have the gold for it and we just want to just chill until like we have the base pretty much or until there's nothing better to do like if our team is just not pressuring for whatever reason like if they've died like now just kidding it's one for one I'm taking part a bigger risk here okay nice I got it oh and of course we're missing five percent cred for the full 100 and that ranged Auto would be really nice though uh what are we doing here I guess we're just waiting for Baron or for Drake for Drake and baron really we're gonna do Drake while we're waiting for Baron God my damage man [Music] I'm just so thank you man because every time I auto it regenerates like 200 hp even it's like 400 HP if I have played up it's ridiculous gotta time the auto for the 50 gold come on there we go GG all right Gamers we are back for another game of ginth diamond this game we're gonna be playing gen Lux into Ezreal Zara so going for a little bit of cheese here see if she lends this she does we'll level up the W as well then and come up together should be an easy kill there nicely done even for a split for me switch onto the minions downstairs we're not going to kill Zyra Oh I thought she hit that mother it's been late then following it up as well since I was busy while sitting damn it okay I can actually just base her I have a knockout amount of bass on but oh hello this might be a kill then oh hang on he is dead eventually oh God but he died Deluxe let's get out of here I don't know if that plush was probably stalling on him honestly but whatever just leave the wave leave the wave this will push towards us can't really try and crash on this HP hmm oh literally only takes 50s here so I can arrive into Lane faster otherwise I would have just done pickaxe and double long sword because I was going to do the correct play here of trying to crash this in as fast as possible to try and maximize the amount of farm the misfortunately however is not amazing this early on so miss minimum will form but the the faster I arrive into Lane the less form I will miss so I want to start Swift is just a get as much as I can here I actually only missed one CS for that base that was actually really nice actually I won't bother even leveling crops here even though I got plenty Mana I actually really use them on level three anyway man this is gonna win three calls for me must have died the minions which is the LIE on my face oh come on kidding me my bad three minutes with that I think we're dead but I'm not entirely sure nice one oh okay here he actually killed him last one I was just pulling that up because I thought her e would be enough to drop him low enough that he would then die do Ronaldo itself would finish him off we can just rush this down something I'll give one more key bounce no worries we'll be some pickaxe now hopefully Zara doesn't freeze this yeah awesome did not feel like walking up at the wave and delaying my base just to make sure she didn't freeze that it's so difficult to work under these conditions holy I just randomly went death in one ear that was freaky my hearing is back now it was literally last mid-sentence I'll be panicking for a moment they're wondering whether my hearing would come back all good that must be semi-proof only but I I think that was the first time it happened mid-sentence and it just threw me off really hard just randomly just hearing my own voice differently well something that Foster would do extra damage to the plant in one shot it but it just acts like any other Auto nice one so whenever a Luxe lands a uh e that's also a pretty much guaranteed W you can land The View on it right because they're gonna be so slowed I didn't even name it right but uh generally they're so slow that if you hit me correctly they're just not gonna be able to dodge it either Lexi or Lux here or there's gonna be free W's every time which is why the combo is so nice nice bounce whatever key hits got soaked up by the plants oh we're getting ganked that didn't even notice ghost damn that's rough damn it I can play this plant there's not a range if I can base and leave this Frozen that's actually really good I don't know why the minutes are turning around there but whatever it's maybe a bit too close to the turret because the minion just stopped following me but nah this works this works could have been an even better free as if I just kept dragging it but this is more than acceptable as well all right so we'll do this this is even more valuable than alongside since I don't want the solo refillable but basically with the small wave clear trick or with sorry wave management trick we're gonna make as you're missing in power with when you otherwise would have missed only like two to three Farms they should have just stuck around mid to make sure they shoved in a wave and obviously like casual was really low so you didn't want to risk it but that really Zara should have been able to distribute that oh I got a minute block away from that personang pressure me there since she had mana and HP just slowed by the E hello there's an oh that was actuallying into her I thought that was their jungler appearing out of vision I'll block the shots speaking of the jungler by the way it isn't knocked and we could watch out for the level six but is he currently level four or is he just now showed up on the map in a while oh wait wait look wait oh it's just AFK okay unless he literally just has not shown up on the map for ages got him oh no I don't oh I thought I'd ghost I was gonna say if he's smart he should be ulting in a brush but I should have been able to finish him off uh like you should have got hit by the old but probably finished them off before he could burst me down but my ward just did not enter the brush that's a bit unfortunate that's my button oh nothing actually isn't FK I guess what level is he though he hasn't appeared in vision what I still can't see his level six because he never feared envisioned that's actually really funny well maybe that's why I haven't seen him open levels if but if he's had like two kills in sitting level six and both of them were like during result and then you never put him Vision afterwards then maybe that's why you're pressed to be level four well ah no but he doesn't have any other kills though so that would have been the first time he's clearly just been very inactive on the map then hello Zara goddammit hit the flash so I don't get the kill okay we'll start shoving this in as well is really low he has the best actually I should be saving that W to combo with locks so he's not really getting many losses here because he has to play so safe okay well this W I'm just gonna use it to get lost heads and she should be aiming for Israel since he wants to lost it Focus as well instead oh we're getting ganked I'm aren't I okay maybe not oh he has all damn oh well is level eight I just didn't go for a while but he wasn't FK fair enough oh damn that's rough come on Shaco oh you want to kill away does he not have q no way oh and he didn't direct the Clone towards knocking that was pretty poorly played okay this is something he might actually die there this cannon is on his case uh but it gave up maybe that gets him though I don't think he will unless he's flush oh in that case okay he did not leave that to chance land me up the way please oh God damn it man it's too late for me to rotate mid now okay this is not taking the whole wave the small cannon tax [Music] Jesus they will die okay I'm gonna go play some Ward when I have deepest version for this Nocturne obviously we see his top side at the moment but should also be able to get this photograph ow whoa should cost that from out of vision damn split that well that was an impossible tataji I think smiles and screams um I may have made a purchase here I'm slowly gonna die here unless yeah I am sad oh does Zara die there probably just an execute though and nobody touched her that's rough one where did I greet here first round to London which cost me like a free visual kill worth of HP then trying to hit this back line when I should have been trying to avoid the Zara it all costs unfortunately nobody actually did I actually hit Israel with anything so there was never any point in actually throwing w at him uh I think I might as well sell this oh wait no I don't need to my bad Russell has made a decent come back in Lane still 40 CS down but actually losing Lane at this point a lot of help from his Landers oh no sorry not his Lane his office but there's Nocturne obviously but like that as you load from the brush there for example that even if that only worked because I just up it was still a really good play like I was pointing out like a good player would do that it was his only choice there to try and live or at least to try and get a kill back I'm really salty I up that word such a minor mistake to make such great consequences he's trying to block your shots for Zyra but he really shouldn't be in this situation wow that lux really needed to be more patient with ultimate as well we didn't see whether I missed the ultimate and if I do then old Israel and if I don't then go for Zara instead especially just missed the ultimate on Ezreal well I was already going for eventually I wouldn't say I can do grump a comfortable speed at this stage maybe I could do it helpfully I'm not sure but it will definitely take me farther long so we'll just go do the Drake nice one maybe we could get six here like I wanted it to the position means something that should be gone but he's got a lot more code potential in Ezra than I do but just go but took up this way of shoveling another one or two at least that'll give us gold for a phantom then sir death should never be quick it should be enough and then maybe chase them down here I'm not entirely sure okay now that I'm does that sure should be free nice one he actually nearly hit me with that it hadn't been so fast would have been a nice prediction yeah this is a risky fight to go for honestly I'm lucky I played it better than him it's not like I can know in advance that I would just barely Dodge some of that stuff I don't have the kind of lead really where I should comfortably go for this place but it worked out this time the reason why that probably should not have worked is because I had to be running into him while he is a champion who from outside of my range can just keep on poking away at me if you're just hitting more of the stuff while I was running into him I would have been low enough that the play wouldn't have worked chasing people down like that it works a lot better either when I got a massive lead so it doesn't matter that he can poke away at me for months out of my range or if they don't have anything to hit me up from outside of my range with so they can start hitting me until I can start hitting them as well and then I know that I just win the the stat check and uh at that so in that occasion I do win the stat check against digital which is why that works so well but I'm just lucky that I barely got it got hit by any poke at all while I was running into him because that really should have ruined my play could maybe do wolves here I think Shaco wants them oh because it's blocking me off ah how I need to go near a wall I've mentioned this in previous videos but what you want to do against Nocturne whenever he's old thing so long as you have flash up you want to go near a wall so you can always flash past it because that's the only reliable way to break the Nocturne tether if you just flash away from him do it like with a regular flash he could still uh not like the tether might not break and so he still chases you down and kills you even if he doesn't have Flash himself but if he flash through a wall that will always break the knocker and tether because he won't be able to immediately chase you in the same direction and it'll just break the tether in that momentary uh second where he's just not chasing you down so whenever you hear the nocturnal you know get ready to flash anything if it flashes up because that's how you're gonna survive him in that instance we're running towards this wall right there I should have been able to get that turret obviously I would rather that whatever wall you flash into it's gonna be in the direction of safety right not into the enemy jungle like if I was to flash through there maybe I'll live maybe I don't depends who's there right there we go all right uh I should have enough for Falconer now yep as well get this one guys well the schedule was in the middle of a great comeback and just been death after death after death after death after death ever since then it was three and five from like zero and five or something and then now three and nine oh my Lord another invisible is that right you up we're just gonna Sprint out of here nothing is pretty far away can't help me yet well if I get into Vision here you will I have no trust but the base here I think sadly unless nice try close close Okay knock them is distracted right now and it's so low that I don't have to be afraid of him anymore actually should be able to get this turret now nothing was a trick well I suppose it's a mountain Drake's it's the thank you strike and they only have two members should have gone to help them but my thought process there was you know Drake is secured we don't need the help we can just focus on basing since the enemy team isn't contesting it doesn't take me too long Sadie Shaco at least thumbs up from the wave here didn't he where is this we can use fk's to figure it out we just need to find the Nocturne Trail oh never even found it though did you not use it and I'm just blind ow l oh I didn't Chris I don't get moving speed ah damn it that sucks try to turn back up threshold to critim so I could run away faster but when I lost Vision so just look dumb oh well let's see what what did I up there with I like turning back onto gen uh sorry ziggs was fine there the fortunate thing is though I was delayed in being able to call jcr I suppose I could have cued him but the key would not also not have killed in there I'm pretty sure because of the shield so just very fortunate that I had to flash through to kill him at least I was able to dodge the Azure all at the same time with that but it wasn't a crit so I'm just running away really slowly I was pretty unfortunate actually especially because I mean I didn't also see what was happening behind me here I wasn't expecting to get flanked I can really evaluate that properly at the moment though some as well seldrons played for a quick look um by the way this will be the last game of the video I forgot to point that out at the start of this game with your strings and then they dance want to stick near looks but it looks like it's not going for us oh Mr Cannon oh they're actually got hit by that my bad that didn't even look like it was aimed at me I didn't think anyway not bad I just assumed I mean I assumed she was aiming at that at Lux right Hacienda like in an in-between point which made it Miss Lux who was who was extremely easy to hit well then it hit me because I thought I could afford to move slightly upwards my bad oh that's not good given up a lot of unnecessary kills here okay when we revive the enemies can't do Baron so we're just gonna rush to the red buff position is that is going to give us midformer otherwise I would have I would have just said oh actually Jess is pushing in this wave which means there's a wave coming into me so we'll just go for on the mid wave then we go the red buff who knows that is forming the wave so we'll just let him have that we don't want to fight over the farm with him we just want to go be efficient do anything else if there is something else available and that is red buff right now he's farming the next wave as well so now we would either go buck there's no bot wave so we just go for Golems instead oh these are really squishy Shaco wants to Raptors I think so I'll let him have those I'm Gonna Knock his butt here because there's still nothing else for me to farm yeah so we're gonna have some down time and farming here oh hello I wasn't paying attention at least I live so long as Nocturne doesn't know me like to get out of vision ASAP okay we're good nothing is over there we'll be healing up with the red buff and life still here ideally Gangplank would be farming something else but it is what it is knocked on here or somebody oh hello but I think probably this game would have been performing better if I was running cleanse I think I just need to run cleanse every game again Zyra it's really high value it's not as important as against like Leona or something but whenever you get hit by random Rosario root it can still easily lead to a one shot combo she follows it up with her ultimate nice one I just pressed R and nothing happened what I decided not to look anyway so it's a good thing am I here oh it's here I just had enough anyway but Jesus I just pressed R nothing happened like what imagine if I did want to hold and the timing was sensitive oh we're about to hold each other ah L6 plus nothing very little damage there yeah so this guy has a bunch of armor and so does Ezreal both of them felt like I was doing uh unusually low damage to him that's why they both had to have armor just weird because both of them never build this much armor this early on we didn't get hit oh again though nice one oh it's loved by the even I didn't see please don't reach me okay I didn't even know Gangplank was low there I have Flash in case he flashes on me yeah I'm good wait the e H God damn it keep accidentally walk into the I don't know if it's just because it's the skin or something but I always miss it you see okay I think this is actually a game where we want to do Lord Dominics nah  that we do plenty of damage if we just chase people down hard enough oh well all I want is a probability so I can just keep chasing people down I never fall solo HP that I need to back off I could be wrong about this but you know this is how we test this Theory try it this is actually one of the first games where I actually do feel like um it feels weird enough to put Lord Dominic's over bloodthirster but blood test has been working out really well so far in literally every scenario no matter how much armor the enemies built and whether I could notice it or not I would be screwed here if he came on me oh is he there  C man oh my God that crit that was a Glenn Israel I'm so sad how much crit do I have 80 percent how sad is that man Jesus um yeah we can't afford for that to happen so I couldn't finish the vamps up there but I'll I'll just accept finishing bloodthirster uh 110 gold later which might not make a difference anyway and just prioritize the correct look over Vamps up there because I think that's a better component oh so there was nothing to do in that situation I didn't choose if I didn't choose long sort over cloak I just could only afford long sword but moving forwards I would rather have the cloak now that I have the choice that was sad man 80 chance to get a kill and probably Escape after and I just don't kill him I don't know if I would have lived actually I don't remember so late to check now but I definitely thought no I think I was just trying to trade one for one but it should have been a one for one I felt very cheated that he didn't get punished for dashing forwards there uh wait my team are on Burn I can't do red buff I need to follow this up in case the enemies contest it's looking like it'll probably just be free but we can't take the risk okay perfect is that looking for the mid Farm as usual I'll go for red buff trying to make myself useful that isn't just sharing form with zed I'd like to get the Raptors and just let shake off Golems I don't want to go for Golems if I can avoid it because the Raptors are actually closer to Mid so if I want to farm a camp in between rotating towards mid I would rather be wrap this foreign this brush I think he is yeah come on I don't get Vision because of the nocturnal nice one at least they weren't coordinated with that sort of just jumped out of the brush anyway s oh is he also have armor he does have some armor not an unusual amount though for effect spawning soon 732 movement speed is what we max out at out without ghost oh my Lord I didn't even get to touch her man yeah definitely cleanse next time we're playing against Zara no matter what the rest of the bot Lane is or the rest of the comp probably should not have hit him there he could have jumped on me and maybe one shot me see what I mean though like if we stay healthy against the central we don't like the damage to kill him regardless of his armor simple knockdown they can get as tank as they want with my movement speed they can never Escape me yeah I'm probably gonna get an Octonaut and then die here but oh well could I get the Jace maybe if I turned on him sooner nah I doubt it One auto would not have done it and that couldn't fit in anymore okay at least we got a few Nexus stories for that possibly worth it especially with getting the strike [Music] I think only against extremely tanky comps like against super tanks like horn malphite rammus only against that kind of stuff do you maybe want to get our Dominics so far I haven't had the chance to test that though we keep not facing super tanky comps just vaguely tanky comps foreign hmm my Lord we're gonna have to flash to break the teller there sadly come on there we go fix a wall but they don't lose HP this guy's certainly about to oh or not maybe not about to die you can W back well it's a bit risky though foreign wait I'm slow how do I keep missing those zigzies man that's crazy all right GG ","24":"foreign this tier list rates Heroes primarily for ranked

is killing it mate especially in higher reloos as an AP carry bot Lane because everything is close range he's an excellent counter pick designer because Zaya has to get close to Auto attacks her Rangers kinda short and because you know all those rain JD carriers apart from Jinx aren't really that good at the moment Carson really just crushes the ball in so here's the first one to consider picking we also have a very similar Champion here this being Swain now for Swain dog and 13.9 the noxian general is gonna be loving it mate they there is going to be a crow storm and we ain't talking fiddle's ultimate because he's getting buffed his Q is both in terms of like using one bolt and also using multiple bolts the base damage an AP ratio they're both going up it's going to be insane so if you have close range Port lanes and you have a Swain in there Whoever has Swain is going to win I'm calling it right now I think his win rate is actually going to improve a lot in the bomb Lane but even in the mid lane but I just recommend picking him as a counter pick two close range Champions if you're playing against range you're not gonna have fun still so just keep that in mind when you pick either of these two Champions karthus and Swain now the 380 carries traditional lady carries the pick and 13.9 these aren't really changing either Draven is the first one Draven has probably been the strongest 80 carry ever since Ryan Earth Caitlin in terms of the actual laning phase he can bully anyone and because of the engaged meta this allows you to land more axes and of course your ultimate both parts of it to get more kills cash in those adoration Stacks GG well played and with Essence we're either into Infinity Edge there is no better snowballing building champion on the rift I'm telling you now a champion who is getting nerfed in 13.9 is jinx your ad growth is going down which means in the midday game you are getting less attack damage oh my God it's over that's fine bro you're still gonna be chilling mate when you pick Jinx the champion because there aren't really like that many scary Lanes maybe Draven is one of them but even then like you should be able to navigate your way out of it and once you get to Kraken Slayer Infinity Edge you might have a little bit less idea levels but who cares your Jinx you're untouchable you're probably still gonna be the number one now Zai is the other AD Carry I've put here guys mainly because she's still doing me very well and she's picked all up and because of the matter as well engage supports they are back if you are probably picking one of those enchantresses you're gonna get left behind and yeah this is what we're seeing in Pro Player a lot right at the moment lots of engage and this goes for the whole entire Rift as well like if you see j4s if you see male fights desire is incredible against every single Champion who's good right now in The Meta so that's why she's also here now the only support guys I've put here because I think there are lots of op Champions at the moment in other roles so the only support here who I think can compete with him is Senna now it's very risky picking Center at the moment blind because you're gonna run into the crank you're gonna run into rakan and Nautilus and Pike it's not going to to be fun ideally you want to be picking Center against a champion who has well not really strong engage so a pretty passive lineup because you're going to outscale them if you can get a free Lane on this Champion she is unreal because of her scaling so that's why I think she's got to be in this countdown now going all the way to the Top Lane the first Champion here has been on these countdowns for God like just ages now this is Jax even though Riot tried to Nerf him well they changed him they did kind of Nerf his early game but his late game is still just as good and yeah if you're going something like what divine Sandra shojin zanya's book into like a lot of HP anything really the champion is just naughty lethal Tempo all grass the undying you've got two options there he is still the PowerHouse in the Top Lane that is the hockey stick now two other Champions one of these is Poppy so if you want to play a tank in the Top Lane poppy because of the Buffs in 13.8 it's actually become insane she's like S Plus they're in every single ELO and she does very well into every single Bruiser fighter I think because they get close to her they have to Auto attack they have to use their closer and spells she just doesn't really like playing against spell casting range Champion so stuff like on and Scion have a really easy to time against her so do be a little bit careful about what I'm picking up but she counted so many champions across the rift as well a bit like Zara in the bot Lane right because of your W as poppy you counter anything with a dash it's not just Top Lane so she's the second top laner and the third top laner is well probably the most difficult Champion to Master on this countdown this is Riven now because Riven with eclipse and then ravenous Hydra the stacking you have the ability haste that they give a close enough so long ago Riven for attack damage and ability has these are your two most important stats and you're getting more haste this has actually been a really big change for her and by going eclipse the armor penetration passive comes overly useful and you can use this in the mid to late game to kill those tanks you're against them bruises of course Riven as well I really don't think she's that weak in the bus a few passes ago made her even better it's just a question of can you actually play Riven can you animation Castle do you know how to put in Auto attacks before just running in like a lunatic Are You Gonna Save Your shield for important moments these are questions you need to ask and we have the answers on our website at gamely.com check it out links down below now moving into the jungle one of these Champions is getting adjusted in 13.9 and honestly I don't know why she's gonna be super busted this is belvip you are getting more Monster damage from your Q why I don't know there's a gold beloved main you know on the balance team and wants to get the Platinum before this uh like kind of first season ends but yeah guys that's what's happening you're getting more Monster damage from your Q you're clearing cams quicker now you are losing a bit of attack damage growth but this doesn't really mean too much like it's not going to equate to heaps in the mid to late game a bit like jinx as well right so what you're sacrificing is a bit of damage mid late game but even more early game clear speed like just get me out this Champion is going to be the best shotgun honestly probably the best champion in the game and 13.9 I'm calling it right now now two other junglers here first of all we have cars X who got blood from lastpatch the extra isolation damage you now have because your Hugo buff which then means it's like two and a half times through isolation damage and your isolation range got buffed as well right Champions can be closer to other Champions and enemies so you can actually proc this a heck of a lot more bro like it's just nuts like this Champion bug Splat if you can get a kill in the early game you're gonna pop off just remember to sell red buff against scary early game Champions and wardrobe blue buff and you should be sweet hit Level 3 GG will played the other Champion here is nidalee more armor from 13.8 in terms of Base armor and armor per level she's nuts best younger in the game check her in High ELO she's bending 50 of games she's not getting nerfed by the way in 13.9 I will touch it all so yeah the cougar is in this countdown now moving into the mid lane guys the last roll three Champions here and they're all AP Champions so if you want to play attack damage I'd recommend maybe like Talon Kiana is pretty good action is really good as well but yeah the three most broken they are all AP Champions but I think it's Justified the first of these is Annie Ryan nerfed Annie for support she is still crazy good as a mid laner and because the meta again is close range that's why you guys should definitely have in your engine that's why you guys should definitely have her in your champion pool also because lots of players are going to be playing at close range in the majority of elos because yeah like playing at range isn't really a thing until maybe you reach high reloads and he can do well regardless right like if there's a close range bot Lane if there's a close range jungle or top planer you're going to be useful regardless yeah now another champion similar to this is Cassiopeia but Cassiopeia I think is just a bit more impressive and also like blind pickable yes is Annie and Cass you might have like kind of the same counters like range Chambers you can't really hit and get access to but Cassiopeia I think is just a bit more versatile she's so strong at the moment because of Sarah she can go right of Ages for Andrew's anguish third item you can even get goggles Stone plane and just be unkillable so Casio has to be here and the final Champion guys in this countdown this is a champion who got buff last patch and this is Katarina so the damage from your passive in particular going up has actually meant the Katarina and higher reloads has really just shot up the list into s plus two categories and she has win rates of like at least 50 152 percent and she's one of the most popular mid-liners this just speaks volumes to how apprecious again it's just like a question of can you actually play her in lower reloads that's it and you guys can give yourself a chance to play her like a challenger just like Riven and every champion on this Countdown by signing up to the game with website and getting access to our library of content our exclusive videos will 100 help you out and help you improve that's what we're about guys those were the 15 most broken champions for 13.9 this has been eggs thanks so much for watching the video please leave a like down below any questions any thoughts leave them in the comments section and until our next video bye ","26":"not all Champions are optimal for every single rank some Champs are just way better in low ELO than in High ELO and vice versa this isn't to say you can't climb with any champion in the game it's just that there are select Champions who are going to make the job much easier on you depending on your rank in today's video we are going to be providing you guys with five of the best champions for every single rank now because there really isn't a massive difference between some of the ranks and therefore we would suggest the exact same champions for some of them we'll be grouping all the ranks into three different ELO brackets the first ring will be low ELO and applicable to anyone ranked from Iron to Gold the second yellow bracket will be the mid or medium ELO bracket consisting of platinum and Diamond lastly the third bracket is High ELO being for Masters and above but before we get into it be sure to check out skill cap if you want to truly get better at League of Legends we're the only service that offers a money back guarantee if you don't climb at least five divisions while actively using our service we do this because our service really does work and if it doesn't work for you you shouldn't pay learn more at the end of this video or click the link in the description below low starting things off for their number one top Lane recommendation for low ELO we have Dr Mundo these Champions that can deal a massive amount of damage but still remain exceptionally tanky are always amazing for the lower ranks Grievous wounds items are also purchased way less in low ELO which allows for the effectiveness of Mundo to be consistently higher when you reach three items and you're practically one-shotting the enemy ADC while taking zero damage in return you'll feel like this Unstoppable raid boss the learning curve for Mundo is not that high either you could go in a ranked first-timing Mundo and be more impactful than the majority of Top Lane Champs build you should run is a heart steel rush into Sunfire each's second and spirit Visage or thornmail third grasp is the optimal Keystone Rune with demolish second wind and overgrowth followed by free boots and approach velocity for secondaries one jungler is absolutely decimating the lower ranks right now and for good reason is Nocturne playing a jungler like Nocturne who has a very simple game plan goes a long way for being consistently impactful for the lower ranks full clearing hitting level 6 as soon as possible and punishing the low ELO players that will just respect Nocturne ultimate is very easy to do a champ like knock who has that semi-global presence to catch enemies out of position is way more powerful for low ELO than for High ELO build diversity is also extremely nice right now for Nocturne as you can go Bruiser or assassin depending on which fits best for each game against a full squishy enemy comp you can go dusk Blade with Axiom Arc and Edge of night into more bruisers or tank Champions a core build of stride breaker Black Cleaver and death stance will do the trick Rune page regardless of build will always be lethal Tempo with Triumph alacrity and coup de gras eyeball collection and ultimate Hunter are the best secondaries there were a couple of good candidates we could have went with for the low ELO mid lane pick but there is one who stands out slightly more than the rest being aurelian Soul Annie is without a doubt a very close second but if your main goal is just to rank up the fastest aurelian Soul has the edge up aurelian is the perfect example of a champion who thrives in the lower ranks but gets demolished in High ELO early laning is not where aurelian thrives but in low ELO you don't get punished nearly as hard for this weakness if a alien can reach a few items he's a complete monster it's just getting there and that can be difficult sometimes but since slow ELO games tend to last quite a bit longer reaching your spikes is much more attainable core build for aurelian soul consists of leandries with rylai's second and archangel's third take first strike for the Keystone Rune with magical Footwear minion dematerializer and Cosmic Insight optimal secondary page is absolute focus and Gathering storm there are very few occasions where this ADC is not the most optimal for the lower ranks as Misfortune is always going to be a must-have in your champion pool if your main goal is to climb MF is a champion capable of being impactful at all stages of the game and does not require any Advanced Mechanical skill to make her work finding angles where you can bounce Q off minions onto the enemy ADC is probably the most difficult part of MF and even then it doesn't take much time to learn in team fights your main focus should be to stay patient in the back line and be ready to play off your teammates engage unleashing your ultimate when the enemy is cc'd is how you want the majority of your team fights to look like with Misfortune core build for Misfortune is a kraken Slayer Rush with bloodthirster second and infinity edge third pickup prestia back with presence of Mind bloodline and coup de gras for primary rune's best secondary page is magical Footwear and biscuits relying on your ADC to carry you is often not going to work out when playing support in the lower ranks which is why Zyra is such a phenomenal option early on in Lane you have to be a little bit careful especially when playing into hook Champions but once you reach level 6 the Solo Carry power is massive this is why you don't see Zyra as much in the higher ranks but for low ELO where support players are not going to punish Ira's early game as much her value is significantly higher Zyra doesn't even need her ADC to follow up on pick plays as she can take out the enemy ADC all by herself with her full combo if you can focus on your vision control around objectives well before they spawn it's going to lead to great things with Zyra sitting in fog of war and waiting for enemies to walk into a choke point is where Zyra can really Thrive as her AOE damage can absolutely melt in those tight corridors core build is leandro's rush into rylai's second and demonic Embrace third roll with Comet as Keystone followed by Mana flow Transcendence and Scorch Taste of blood and Relentless Hunter are the best secondaries moving on to our picks for the medium ELO bracket being platinum and Diamond the top laner we recommend is Pantheon Pantheon Works a little better for the higher ranks where it's easier to play off early game advantages winning Lane is very important with Pantheon so you've got to have a good grasp of matchups and how to approach each lane path has one of the best early games for any top laner so you've got to be able to abuse it to see results with him Mundo on the other hand who was our low ELO Top Lane pick and get away with losing Lane and as long as games drag out he's still going to be very useful the same can't be said for pimp as he scales quite poorly build for Pantheon is an eclipse rush into Black Cleaver second and Spear of shojin third grab conqueror for the Keystone with presence of Mind tenacity and Last Stand followed by conditioning and overgrowth fresh off some really great Buffs in 13.8 our jungle selection for the medium ELO bracket is kha'zix although kha'zix does not require insane mechanical prowess to pull off the way in which you look to approach fights is what makes him a bit more difficult and a good fit for platinum diamond with Nocturne it's all about finding that priority Target at a position and using your point and click R not a ton of decision making goes into that on the other other hand with kha'zix you've got to be a lot more Shifty properly utilizing stealth and being in the right position to capitalize when the enemy becomes isolated knowing how to play with the lead is also very important with kha'zix as he can completely steamroll games when ahead due to his stealth mobility and one shot power standard build for kha'zix is a dustblade rush and ghostblade second and Edge of Knight Third Run first strike for the Keystone Rune with magical Footwear Futures market and Cosmic Insight Sudden Impact and treasure hunter are for secondaries one mid lane champion who fits really well into that Medium ELO bracket right now is Ari although Ari is a bit more mechanically demanding than some mid lane Champions the way you look to approach fights is rather straightforward with someone like aurelian soul you can kind of just win by existing if games drag out super long but with Ari you've got to apply a bit more macro knowledge to make her work optimally being in the right position ready to find picks from fog of war and utilizing the fog of War properly to easily hit charms is key to winning with Ari diving straight in on someone and catching them out in the open can work from time to time but if you can be throwing your skill shots from a position where the enemy doesn't even see them coming it will drastically improve your re win rate playing arum and just winning through 5v5 fights is great for someone like aurelian Seoul but Ari thrives off catch plays which requires more game knowledge core build for Ari is an Ever Frost rush into Shadow flame second and ramadan's third pick up electrocute for the Keystone with Taste of blood eyeball collection and ultimate Hunter Mana flow and Transcendence are the best for secondaries this ADC is great for any ELO bracket right now but is definitely the most optimal for Platte and Diamond being Jinx positioning and being able to kite effectively is a little more important on someone like jinxed and Misfortune so she's a great fit for the medium ELO bracket if you can press your R key at a decent time that's often all you need to do to be impactful with Misfortune while being able to consistently weave Autos is extremely important for Jinx once you've reached Platt on ABC you should have at least decent mechanics to where you can start to Pilot someone like Jinx on a level that makes her worthwhile core builds a run for Jinx is a kraken Slayer Rush with infinity edge and Rapid Fire Cannon lethal tempos the Keystone Rune with presence of Mind bloodline and coup de gras run absolute focus and Gathering store for secondaries blitzcrank is the perfect example of a champion who fits insanely well into the medium ELO bracket in the lower ranks it can be frustrating to play Blitz where your ADC never seems to be in position to capitalize on your hook place at least being semi-on the same page as your ADC is important to winning with blitz and you just never know what to expect in low ELO on the other end of the Spectrum in High ELO players are generally pretty good at playing around to Blitz not giving him too many easy openings so it's a bit harder to make him work when we meet in the middle with the medium ELO bracket your ADC is at least a bit more competent and the enemy bot Lane doesn't fully respect you so the carry potential Blitz is so much higher build you want to run for Blitz is a shiralius rush into Zeke's second and wardstone third baroons run glacial augment with hex flash biscuits and Cosmic Insight secondaries are bone plating and unflinching moving on to our five picks for High ELO the Top Lane selection is going to be Jace Jace should really be a champion only unlockable once you reach Master tier because you need exceptionally strong micro and macro skill to play The Champ to his potential that being said a Jace player who knows what he's doing can turn the champion into the most oppressive pick in the game winning early game is extremely important to seeing success on Jace so that automatically eliminates him from being a good low ELO top laner Jace can often set up waves for early dive plays however relying on your jungler to execute on them is something you can really only expect in Masters and above by all means you can play Jason any ELO bracket but his true form is going to shine most in Masters and above without question core build for Jace is an eclipse rush in a man immune second in ghostblade third conqueror and phase Rush are both viable Keystone options conqueror works better against bruisers or tanks where you need extended fights to win out while phase Rush is great when you need those short trades against squishier Champs a jungler just buffed in 13.8 and who's now an absolute Beast of a pick for High ELO is nidalee a base armor buff may not seem like a big deal but for a champion like nidalee who thrives throughout the early game any buff that helps her early on is huge as a champion who's 100 reliant on hitting a skill shot to be effective and also gets outscaled by the majority of junglers is no secret in Italy is a crappy low ELO champ but a monster in the higher lucky for nid and what actually makes her an even better pick for the current meta is the fact we've got thresh and Recon being played in 40 of High ELO games these Champs who can CC the enemy for an extended duration makes the life of an Italy player so much easier if your Masters are above and can pilot a good nidalee she should be in your champion pool for 13.8 due to those recent Buffs standard build is night Harvester with Shadow flame second and zanya's third take dark Harvest for the Keystone Rune with Sudden Impact eyeball collection and treasure hunter Transcendence and water walking are optimal secondaries a mid lane champion who everyone can appreciate when they have a mechanically sound one on their team is Cassiopeia Cass can work for the other ELO brackets as well but she's definitely the most optimal in High ELO where a kit can be fully exploited in High ELO we see a lot more of these dive heavy Champions picks that need to get right on top of you and deal their damage and Cassio completely obliterates them you see a lot less of the vagars and aurelian souls in High ELO and way more of the leblanc's and silas's Casio is super lethal when you can set up Vision around objectives and play for picks when the enemy team walks to take corridors this is something you can't execute on as much in the lower ranks since it's unlikely your support will provide reliable Vision the build for Cassiopeia is a rod of Aegis rush into Archangel second and rylies or stone plate third conqueror is the best Keystone Rune with presence of Mind tenacity and Last Stand run manaflow and Transcendence for secondaries throughout the years there has always been one ADC who tends to excel more in the higher ranks and that statement holds true right now with Draven being our High ELO pick being very early game Reliant Draven is so much better off when paired with the competent support who knows the limits of Draven you're just not going to find that in the lower ranks so even though you can still make Draven work he's going to be way more impactful for the higher end in low ELO where you can't depend as much on your support playing an ADC us scaling insurance is often way better to carry consistently not only do you rely more on your support to win with Draven but he's not easy to Pilot either catching axes is super unique to the champion and mechanic that will take a while to pick up when first learning the champ if you're playing Draven in low ELO with no mechanical skill and with the support who has no clue what they're doing it's just such a coin toss build for draving consists of an Essence Reaver rush into Infinity Edge second and bloodthirster third lethal Tempo is always the Keystone Rune with Triumph bloodline and Last Stand eyeball collection and treasure hunter are the secondaries One support who's crazy good for any ELO right now but even better for the higher ranks is milio the only issue with melio and the majority of other enchanters for low ELO is that you're very reliant on your teammates to be decent and if they're not you're quite Limited in what you can do in High ELO where you have teammates that know what they're doing buffing them up is way more rewarding as long as you're throwing everything on your fed carry you can rely way more on them to execute fights and get the job done in high elap while in low ELO it's way less of a sure thing Milio's kit is insanely strong right now so when paired with players who can capitalize on that he's an absolutely incredible pick the build you want to run is Australia's rush into Arden sensor second and Redemption third Arie is the optimal Keystone with Mana flow Transcendence and Scorch followed by bone plating and revitalized for secondaries alright guys before we wrap this up let's tell you a little more about skill cap so we offer a five division rank up guarantee and think that's a pretty crazy thing to offer it's like a gym membership guaranteeing you'll get ripped your local gym

best champions for every single rank in patch 13.8 thank you all so much for watching good luck in solo queue and we will see you in the next one ","27":"has crit Graves made a comeback due to recent Buffs does tank Caterina still work or should you be building her differently now we've got all this and much more to discuss as we break down the new meta Trends and provide you guys a complete update on the solo queue tier list thanks to the help of our Challenger players and analyzing the most recent data but before we get into it be sure to check out skill cap if you want to truly get better at League of Legends we're the only service that offers a money-back guarantee if you don't climb at least five divisions while actively using our service we do this because our service really does work and if it doesn't work for you you shouldn't pay learn more at the end of this video or click the link in the description below Olaf was the only top laner directly nerfed this patch and he's landed right where we expected power wise the Nerfs were not enough to remove him from meta as he's slotting in as a good s tier option with death's dance being changed for 13.7 we are seeing more Olaf players prioritizing it as an earlier purchase now in previous patches the build of ravenous and jock show was by far the most popular but now in 13.7 stride breaker with death stance has shot up in priority into comps that are more ad heavy skipping jock show and going into death stance instead is a great strategy both setups are still really good and a lot of it comes down to preference but changes to death stance make it a better second pick up again one top laner who has been on the rise in recent patches due to shifts in meta is Scion cyan is one of the few top laners who performs at a positive rate against malphite and mordekaiser especially with malphite being so heavily contested in meta using cyan as an answer has great value right now malphite loves playing into Champions who are Auto attack Reliant due to his attack speed slow from E and armor scaling but since Scion deals the majority of his damage from spells and removes armor with his e much of malphite's strengths are thrown out the window if you're looking for a strong Top Lane tank that does well in meta and is relatively easy to pick up Zion is a great option placed in our Top Lane s tier for the Top Lane tier list it's looking pretty much identical to where we had in our pre-patch update malphite is without question the most free elo Top Lane Champion you can play arguably the most sleeper Top Lane pick for 13.7 is maokai his core build a Sunfire Abyssal and even shroud has got even stronger this patch due to the Abyssal Buffs and is a really good answer to malphite Champ is being played a ton more over in Korea than in the western regions and is performing insanely well statistically best top laners to climb low ELO the fastest are York malphite and masses highest on the ban list are Fiora Darius and malphite as noted during the intro Graves with a crit build has been on the rise this patch and is looking like his most optimal build if you didn't read the patch notes Graves Critical Strike damage per pellet was increased from 20 to 30 percent which is a pretty massive increase as a result the win rate of a shield bow Rush has shot up over three percent there are a few different variations to the build you can run depending on the enemy composition if you're playing against majority bruisers or tanks then going Shield bow with bloodthirster is a great two item core against a very squishy enemy comp who won't be stacking any armor The Collector works great in place of bloodthirster infinity edge is going to be the third item you'll want to complete for most games Rune wise you definitely want to go Fleet footwork instead of dark Harvest it's more so about that consistent damage kiting around and staying alive with this build so Fleet off offers more value over dark Harvest if you're thinking of picking up Graves we just uploaded our master and minutes course to our website which will help to greatly fast track your success in the Champ for Graves tearless placement he finds a spot in our a tier as a good jungle pickup the jungle tier list there's simply nobody that comes close to rivaling jarvan's power right now so we're handing him the crown as the only optier jungler we were optimistic the COS exchanges would turn out net positive but so far it's looking like the W Nerfs are outweighing the Q and R Buffs in the grand scheme of things the changes were pretty neutral so we will be shifting Cobb back into a tier for the mid patch update all the other jungle Buffs and Nerfs have landed where we anticipated Wukong is now a decent eight-tier jungler but nothing special anymore sejuani is now on the weaker side sitting in B tier after her Nerfs and Vai remains a good eight-tier pick building full Bruiser now instead of radiant virtue Lee and rammus are both completely fine as well despite their Nerfs being solid a-tier pickups optimal low ELO junglers of the patch are Fiddlesticks mordekaiser and Jarvan Evelyn Kane and Jarvan are on top of the Jungle ban list Katarina saw a few changes this patch aimed at incentivizing Players to build AP instead of Bruiser AVP builds have definitely become stronger but at the same time Bruiser cat has not fallen off much at all either Divine Sunder with Wit's End and randuins is still a really great build in games where the enemy comp is more Bruiser or tank Champs when you are against majority squishies that you can easily one shot that is where going gnashers with rocket belt fits in best overall build diversity is really nice for cat right now and she can adapt well to each game and finds a spot in our mid lane s tier taking a look at the mid lane tier list we have a few small adjustments to discuss Annie and Pantheon remain on top as the best solo queue mid laners Cassiopeia has been adjusted down into s tier as the Catalyst Nerfs have led to a small decrease in power that pushes her below Annie and Pam despite vegar being nerfed he's actually performing better this patch for the lower ranks than before the scaling power of agar's abilities were increased and since low ELO games tend to last a little longer the changes haven't actually negatively impacted him stat Wise High ELO vegar is definitely worse off but since arterialists are catered more towards what's best for diamond and Below we will be moving vegar back into the mid lane a tier with Katarina being buffed this patch she's now the most played solo queue mid laner so if you're looking for a good answer to the pick our op tier Champs Annie and Pantheon both do incredibly well top three mid laners to climb low ELO include vegar malzar and Annie Annie Zed and Fizz are a few of the highest priority bands it's been a rather quiet patch down in bot Lane for ADC as the Zary Nerfs were the only influential changes due to the Nerfs zarya's lost a small chunk of power resulting in her moving to a tier but she's still a great option if you can pilot her well Jinx will continue to dominate the bot Lane meta as the highest priority ADC and the lone op champ on the tier list the vagar Nerfs have seen him lose a fair bit more power for bot Lane than for mid lane since vegar struggles to get levels in bot Lane due to him sharing experience with his support he doesn't get to benefit from the scaling Buffs on his abilities as much as mid lane vegar does despite the Nerfs vagar is still a great s tier bot laner but not super broken like before kalista was the only other ADC changed for this patch and the Buffs have shaped out exactly as we expected they have led to callista gaining a little bit of power but not nearly enough to Warrant a move back into meta after bot Lane carries for low ELO include Tristana Misfortune vegar Jinx vegar and Samira are three bot Lane Champs worth Banning out with thresh currently the most played support throughout all ELO brackets and not phased At All by the Nerfs this patch who can you pull out as a good counter Heimer is one of the best options as his turrets do an incredible job at shutting down thresh's pick power Heimer has seen a pretty big drop off in play rate over the past few patches but there's really no reason for it even if thresh does land a hook in Lane if you've got a few turrets available you're going to be able to turn on him and at least trade one for one if he tries to dive in for a pure carry support there are a few better options than Heimer and he is placed in our support s tier despite many support Champions being altered this patch The Meta has not seen much of a shake-up at all opiates here for support consists of milio rakan senna and blitzcrank we noted last patch how the majority of milio players were using the wrong skill order but now that most players have caught on he's looking even more op than before just to be clear it's an e-max first into W second and Q last for the optimal skill order on Emilio also worth noting if possible you want to be the one one running heel instead of your ADC milio runs Arden as a core purchase so the more heals you have the more ways to constantly be procking its passive thresh and Annie were both nerfed but they have only Fallen very slightly in power and are still amazing s tier options this is arguably one of the biggest filler patches we've seen in a while with nothing but Placebo Buffs and Nerfs that don't actually accomplish a whole lot in significantly Shifting The Meta the best low ELO carries for support in 13.7 are milio Annie and Zyra we've got Recon thresh and milio as the three most banworthy supports all right guys before we wrap this up let's tell you a little more about skill cap so we offer a five division rank up guarantee and think that's a pretty crazy thing to offer it's like a gym membership guaranteeing you'll get ripped your local gym would go bust if they offered that right not us we've offered this for years because our service really does work it works so well in fact that we're able to produce by far the largest catalog of Premium League guides on the internet we add over 20 videos a week with over 1600 guides curated into over 100 courses no one can compare we've also sent Challenger players into ELO hell's 704 14 times and Counting where they commentate how to carry live they also respond to all questions asked sign up today for as little as 6.99 a month if you are serious about improving so there you have it guys a complete look at the solo queue tier list as we reach the Midway Mark of 13.7 thank you all so much for watching good luck in solo queue and we'll see you in the next one ","28":"foreign Lucian or something there's no way that'll be the draft for the 900th time oh the plot twist they took Divine instead of the maokai no way does that mean they get the maokai oh my god well that's crazy and now they get the Lulu right no way no way how did that happen Jesus man dude I'm so sick of seeing Lucian Nami though I'm so sick of seeing Lucian Nami and Yumi every game bro I'm done with it hundreds of pro players around the world screaming hundreds of games a week and they've all come to the same conclusion of this is how the game should be played and with all of them coming to that conclusion I feel like the game is just so figured out that there's no room for innovation I don't think that I would normally put extra stock into content creators saying that Pros keep defaulting to the same Champions because that's just normal League stuff isn't it I can already kind of see you typing your comment right now Pros playing the same Champions every game well water's wet hope is Catholic League sucks aren't these just Facts of Life at this point and fair enough but this situation might be a little bit more of an issue than normal these two guys kadral and Dom are two of the most passionate and knowledgeable voices for competitive League of Legends both are former pro players cadral is a caster and domco streams a lot of pro matches even for n a which not only impresses me for his commitment but also proves that he's a masochist and when they both highlighted the exact same problem within the first week of pro play coming back which should normally be a very exciting time as there's new teams and new story lines I felt that it was worth discussing I believe the biggest reason is that even though it's a brand new season hardly anything changed and it almost feels like we're in the exact same meta as we were during the world championship and it's not just Pro play but also solo queue especially in two roles bot and jungle these two roles have been completely squeezed with very low variety on what actually works and this has caused the player base to react in a way that's honestly warranted a majority of the time gaming communities can be extremely hypocritical and full of baseless overreactions but in this case I feel we really do have the right to call out Riot for their incompetence here questioning what in the world they've been doing considering the pre-season change very little and the season cinematic is arguably the biggest fail in the history of the game in the bot Lane only a few Champions and strategies are viable there's essentially two categories you can pick the broken Duos of Lucian Nami who are nearly always picked together or some combination of ADC zarian sivir plus Lulu and Yumi for support and prozel just mix and match these based on whatever they get if you're not seeing this most of the time you're going to play against a bot Lane that has unbeatable pushing priority which would be like ash Caitlyn or varus ADC paired with Heimerdinger Karma or Ash support and in quite a few cases now we're getting double 80 carries in the bot Lane Caitlyn's support kalista support gin support varus support carya is on a war path determined to play any ADC in the support role I swear if caria and his ADC gumiyushi could pick two Caitlyn's or two ashes right now they probably would [Music] for these pushing compositions how come they're able to play a bot Lane that was never able to succeed in the past where is the blitzcrank all in how come they don't just Place Samira Rel into this the thing is is that pushing priority in Lane control has never been more important than it is now largely due to Turret plating and neutral objectives being so powerful you can get away with what should be an inferior composition just because of the early game map control it can be tough to give away dragons when ride buff Drakes my initial thought was that bot Lane priority is going to be even more important than it already was when a team goes up something like two Drakes to zero while it's not necessarily true that they're guaranteed to win and get Soul it's such a fantastic lead that teams aren't willing to give it pro junglers this season have shown such a high priority that they're out here soloing it as a level 3 poppy a big part of this equation that I've seen some pros talking about is the support items themselves when the support can generate more than enough gold simply by hitting the enemy with spells and autoing the turret from range with either the spelltheast or the sickle it can trivialize the laning phase the melee supports have to walk up and get hit with spells and trade Health just to generate any gold the disadvantage of being melee is constantly punished while the range support is reaping all of the benefits every time you walk up and because the jungle meta has been squeezed into s-tier only which we'll get to in a moment a common thing you're seeing now is junglers who do leashless at the highest levels of play bot Lane is no longer leashing they are always contesting the push from level 1. two marksmen both with Halo blades walking up to you level 1 taking all of your health and blowing your sums as interactive and fun as that might seem you can take my word for it it isn't as for the support 80 carry they don't really lack resources because the game tends to end before that even matters anyway your team is going to dominate to the point of no return in theory Caitlyn's support should have problems taking resources away from the 80 carry but they're not a thousand gold is generated rather quickly from the support item they can take all the play late Spot Lane they can take all the plates mid lane secure Drake secure Herald and win the game even with just one item typically being umbral glaive which is a cheap and cost effective supportive item double range bot is very strong and one of the only ways you can deal with it is by picking a broken Duo for these op combos it's true that they don't have the same priority early game but on two to three items their complete Juggernaut hyper carries stronger than we've ever seen some of the hyper carries that come to mind in game history are like Jinx or twitch or kog'maw and it's true they are monsters on six items but it doesn't really compare to a sivir or zerri who have a Yumi attached the only reason that we see this scaling bot Lane in a meta that is so reliant on early game is because nothing beats this late game it is genuinely going to take nerfing both of the Champions into the ground and reworking them to make Pros stop picking Zary and Yumi and that's exactly what Riot is trying to do they are doing their best to effectively remove Yumi from the game because we've never seen an unbeatable combo quite like this we need dragon and Herald and baron because it forces action and in theory they're great for the game but it's not always interesting at the moment especially for some of the early Dragon takes it's kind of lame how either you pick a pushing bot and you can contest for strike or you just give it this meta is so what's the word we can use boring maybe that's not quite right brainless is that a bit harsh maybe how about predetermined sure let's go with predetermined first 20 minutes of the game versus Lucian Nami okay we can never trade after 20 minutes against zero Yumi okay we can't fight anymore laning phase versus Caitlyn Ash okay we can't play the game just uninstall and go play Ellen ring this is what bot Lane looks like every game now no leash for the jungler fight at level 1 and seize control Caitlyn Ash bot Lane steps on you level one Caitlyn gets a double kill and the game feels doomed the point is that this just feels so bad to play regardless of balance maybe you could even come up with some numbers and ride can provide data to say that this is reasonable x-champion does actually beat y champion on average the amount of the time while logic should state that we'll trust the numbers here ultimately what I'm trying to articulate is a feeling if you want to play a lower tier bot Lane good luck picking something like Jinx Janna which is a classic Lane I'm sure many of us have played it countless times should now be reportable for griefing because this Lane is unplayable the jungle roster also feels like it's impossible to play anything that's not meta the gatekeeping factor for junglers last season was all based around clear speed and the ability to kite camps and while it is true that that's no longer as big of a deal that does not mean the problem is solved it's just different now the first clear beats you up so bad that if you try to play an off meta jungler it's not going to go very well even though a core thing they wanted to outline and accomplish with this new Season's jungle was to make more off meta junglers viable they have not done that maokai Vai or sejuani will gank five times before level six Wukong will dive your Bot Lane Kindred or Udyr will invade you you get the idea you are hard capped into playing the best junglers in the game who can go leashless and gank bot Lane if you can't do that your life is going to be way harder than it should be the other jungler is playing an Exodia champion who can do it all and you're just trying to complete one clear this is even more of an issue in competitive play because again the neutral objectives are a total Game Changer and missing out on the Smite upgrades makes it no longer a 50 50. the team whose jungler has the Smite Advantage has all the priority on the objective which from my understanding and what I had thought wasn't that the entire reason Riot changed it in the first place remember when Smite used to be based on your Champion's level we're sort of back to someone of a similar problem that's the issue outlined so what do we have in the future could we finally get a new meta maybe the best news to come out of League of Legends over the past couple of weeks is that many of the things that were talked about in this video have been at least addressed acknowledged or talked about by Riot and most of the things as well have been nerfed or going to get nerfed Yumi is no longer a problem on this current patch but it's not for a good reason it's because they had to Nerf the champion so much that she is now effectively unplayable and is going to get reworked she's been put into a dead State very similar to how zerry was about six months ago and we all saw how that turned out humble glaive got nerfed radiant virtue got nerfed Riot could be looking to double down on the radiant virtue Nerfs and hitting it again Riot has buffed melee supports across the board Alistar Nautilus Brahm Pantheon Pike Recon and thresh these types of Champions should have been the counter to range supports and they simply were not in order to make more Champions have a viable clear they need to do individual targeted Buffs the issue is that their history of doing this is often not very good they've done these kinds of changes in the past one time they did it with Morgana where she was hard forced into being the best jungler in the game she dominated for a while was pick and Bannon Pro got nerfed and now isn't a jungler anymore uh sick balancing I guess and just recently we got the early notes for patch 13.4 this is one of the more promising and optimistic patches for me in quite a while because I'm honestly on board with about 80 to 90 percent of these changes which I do not often feel about League of Legends patches and it also seems that some prominent members of the community are also pretty happy about it we're addressing the spell thiefs and spectral sickle which is great Relic Shield and steel shoulder guards Buffs which is awesome for melee supports at the time of recording this video I have no idea exactly what they mean by jungle sustain and clear speed but I can only hope it frees up the jungle meta and means that we can finally see some new pics I truly believe the biggest reason that League of Legends has been able to sustain a long term player base is because the game always changes the game is different year to year and as it stands right now the game is not different enough from the previous year or honestly even the previous two years so thank you Riot for addressing the problem keep doing it make more changes mix up the meta and let's play a new game let me know what you guys think of the current patch and the upcoming changes for league are you excited for them are you a little bit optimistic or maybe even pessimistic do you trust that Riot will change the game or are you perfectly happy with the way it is now whatever you think feel free to let me know in the comments down below and I'll see you guys next time ","29":"and in today's video 13.9 three most broken champions for each roll this video is going to help you out so much man like if you guys pick these Champions bro well you actually might win more I'm not gonna lie yeah welcome to the video guys it's a pleasure having you here and if you do want to give yourself a chance to get your Challenger gamelap.com is the site you need bro because it's got me it's therefore the best informative website in terms of League of Legends on the internet you're listening to someone bro who is coached to rank 1 the US who is coach rank one of us coached a challenger every single role in the game bro you can improve and give yourself a chance to climb divisions and Tears by listening to the coaching the videos that I've put on the website in the last few years you will 100 improve links down below check it out get that exclusive access to the library content by signing up let's get into the three most broke of ritual in 13.9 starting with top laners first of all we have Riven coming in at number three with eclipse from ravenous Hydra this big sordid Whitehead chick don't know how to describe it is still very very strong because of the eclipse changes and also long ago where they gave it a bill lady has to remove the omnivamp ability heads is really important for Riven also the Buster Riven herself a few patches ago this Champion is pretty nutty it's just about playing her at a higher level and to do just that again the website is just a click away so click on it number two this is Poppy if you guys want a champion who pretty much like crushes every single Bruiser fight in the game Poppy's the champion for you guys does so well because of her W it's very hard for those Champions to run into her she does struggle a little bit like I mentioned in recent videos against those Champions who are happy to play at range so be a little bit careful why I'm picking up if you do see a vein in the top lane or like an awn or a sign they spell casters you are going to FF but poppy at the moment because the bus in 13.8 she is killing it and she's number two number one a champion who hates going against poppy but is just too innately broken for me not to put a number one this is Jax Jax is number one with the whole key Stick to find Sandra Spirit shojin's on his hourglass because of the AP ratio you have I don't know what right we're thinking but anyway even if you're laning phase is a little bit weaker because of those changes early in season 13. it doesn't matter your mid to late game is so strong and most games are going to go to the mid to late game because most games are played in lower elos so the Grand Master at Arms is number one for Top Lane for another patch get me out right change the meta now moving into the jungle number three cars Xbox by the Cockroach he's number three because the bus from last patch to his Q right this means you're dealing more damage from just like your basic Cube your isolated Q is dealing like two and a half times more damage than what it was before and because of the Buffs in 13.7 to your isolate Q range this means that you can just cue you know people in isolation more often this is seen car6's win rate shoot up in every single rank is an S plus two Champion that's why he's number three just be a little bit careful early on of getting invaded and cheese number two this is nidalee bass armor going up on this champion armor per growth going up this is a champion who's uncounterable in the jungle in Korean high low she spending over 50 percent of games she's here because if you can play her well and lots of these Champions are actually kind of high skill seeming on this countdown but she could easily be the most oppressive champion on the Riff right now and there's a reason why the best players in the world are Banning are pretty much every single game she's number two number one a champion who will probably be banned even more than diddle in 13.9 is built with you guys might be like but velvet if you're losing attack damage growth and 13.9 yeah you are so mid to late game you're getting less attack damage but guess what you're getting 20 more damage to monsters your clear speed early game mid game late game well especially early mid game right because you are clearing camps for the most part in the First 15-20 minutes you're gonna be nuts bro like you're gonna be the best jungler on the rift and I could be the best Champion if I were you guys I'd play bellef and try to learn if the rest of 13.8 so when 13.9 hits the rift you win 10 games in a row moving into the mid lane number three this is Annie if you guys see close range Nuss on the enemy team some Champions who want to get in your grill then pick this Champion bro absolutely unreal you guys might be like but then she get nerfed a few pass ago yes she did put her eager on Earth to later ranks this was really for support Annie yes mid lane Annie of course you have to make sure he at some point but you're not about that what you are about is using your stun using your tebers shielding tables and it's just over but the championship is still way too good even if you're in a bad matchup in the mid lane but trust me you're gonna have chances to kill them you're gonna have chances in team fights because there will be at least a couple or a few Champions on the NBA team who want to get in your grill that's what you're playing this Champion for the Annie is number three now number two because the Buff's last patch especially to Katarina's passive the dagger damage you're now dealing to Champion's Katarina is number two and that's just how it is like her win rates and high reloads have really gone up and that's because well Katarina plays in high reels are really getting the most out of this champion and Katarina is a champion who does have like kind of a lot of hard Lanes if we're thinking about stuff like you know maybe galio Mao zahar malzaha who's very popular in lower elos but this champ is still to have like over a 51.52 percent win rate and be classified as s plaster speaks volumes to how good she actually is and it's all because those Buffs last patch in 13.8 so 13.9 cat this noxion assassin has to be here now Cassiopeia another champion hailing from noxus is number one so for Casio in the mid lane you are like Annie but on steroids so basically you're playing a champion on performance enhancers Casio is just that bastard right now whether you're going right of Ages leandros anguish and desera send to goggles stone plate doesn't really matter bro build anything this Champion is nuts the close range matter and how broken you are right now bro like number one mid laner in the game I don't think it's even close now moving into the bolt Lane here we have two a P carry bot liners kind of sorry to say that because yeah I am well kind of a boomer so you know back in the day everyone would be playing traditional lady Carrie so there's only one in the month it's countdown but yeah coming in at number three this is Swain and because Swain is getting buffed in 13.9 your Q's damage is going up the base damage the AP ratio that's not just for one bolt that's for multiple Bots you might be able to throw out right so I think this is going to be Naruto Swain not only in the early game you have to respect swine skew a little bit more you know he's not just going to tickle you with this but also in the mid to late game you're going to be dealing like a significant amount of damage especially over the course of a long team fight so Swain I think is going to be nuts the close range matter as well which is what most of these Champions are on this list for but yeah he's gonna throw off it so watch out for the crow King in 13.9 now One champion who actually would do very well against Swain is jinx she is the only like kind of typical ad carry on this countdown guys and even though you're getting nerfed you're losing attack damage growth so exactly like belvoth I guess but it's not going to be substantial enough man to bring this ad carry it down and off this countdown you're still holding on to the attack speed buff they gave you a few passes ago and because is not many champions in the bottom line are that scary for you maybe draven's the only one you have to care about so yeah I'll probably ban him apart from that man like you're chilling Jinx is number two on this Countdown the best of the pure ad carries now number one if you guys don't want to play Swain but you still want to really annoy the enemy bot Lane and Team by picking one of these kind of like yeah unorthodox picks then karthus it is but he's not unorthodox he's actually the best AP Gary bottlinger in Portland in the game right now engaged matter close range matter think about karthus okay you're thinking about I can smell the rubber burning that's why he's number one congrats now moving down to the support it's number three we are milio millio is here guys just because of stats I don't actually think this Champion is like that op well especially if you're gonna blind pick him there's so many counter picks but according to the stats S Plus they're really good Winery special given the pick rates and stuff similarious number three if you want someone to peel your ad carry and keep them alive now number two is a champion who got Nerf last patch rakan your armaged on Earth your armor growth gone nerfed wasn't really that big so regard is still going to be Giga broken yeah the bus at the start of the season and also making I guess like shirelli is better this Champion even radiant virtually you can go on him so yeah rakan is just still one of those versatile and best supports in the game he is a favorite of mine as well the he's number two so much biased man anyway number one guys on the account and this is a champion who does very well against Emilio who's the support we mentioned first but she also does very well against lots of passive laners because you outscale everyone and of course guys thank you so much for watching this video if you did enjoy please leave a like down below any questions thoughts on the pics leave them in the comment section the number one support you guys will probably guess it this is Senna because the bus to this Champion a few passes ago she's really taken off whether you're going something like hard still to just break the enemy mental or if you're going like you know Eclipse into mirror man or something like this you can even go like wrap a  there's a bunch of bills right she's really fun to play as well because of that and yeah I'll just be careful maybe about blind picking her because if you run into Pike or blitzcrank or nordl or something like this you are going to want to like just leave the game but Senator is number one guys the stats as well back this up so those were the three most broken chance of retro and 13.9 thank you so much for watching the video this has been eight peace ","30":"patch 13.8 is upon us so it's time for a complete update on the best solo carries as always we will be covering three champions for every single role that hold the greatest ability to impact games on their own for the current meta but before we get into it be sure to check out skill cap if you want to truly get better at League of Legends we're the only service that offers a money back guarantee if you don't climb at least five divisions while actively using our service we do this because our service really does work and if it doesn't work for you you shouldn't pay learn more at the end of this video or click the link in the description below now that malphite has finally been nerfed a tank top laner that should not be slept on for 13.8 is Scion Scion is slowly but surely been climbing in priority over the past few patches and with the champ being a really good answer to malphite he's going to be even better off in 13.8 in previous patches Scion was one of the few top laners who had a positive win rate in the malphite matchup winning over 53 percent of the time Darius is a solid band option for Scion as the consistent DPS and true damage of Darius is difficult for Scion to play around winning Lane and spreading that lead across the map with Scions Immaculate Rome power should be your goal in every single game we really like these Top Lane picks who have the ability to influence the map because it makes closing out games when you're ahead much easier the build for Scion is a heart steel rush into Sunfire each a second and Titanic Hydra Third Run grasp for the Keystone Rune with demolished conditioning and overgrowth minion dematerializer and approach velocity are the best secondaries our second Top Lane Solo Carry is another who has very strong map impact at level 6 being Pantheon Pantheon is the best fighter Top Lane champ that you can play for solo queue right now very easy to pick up and very strong in meta which makes him a no-brainer add to your champion pool Mal Nerf this patch is great for Panthers well since it was one matchup he's been struggling with in recent patches these tankier tops are who panth has a harder time against so using your ban on Scion or malphite is good value to see maximum success on Pantheon you need to be taking advantage of his potent laning power poking the enemy with Q when they are going for last hits whittling them down and then going all in with your full combo and ignite should be the game plan in melee matchups to learn more about trading effectively in Lane our master and minutes trading course is a great resource that can be found on our website build for Pantheon is an eclipse rush and a Black Cleaver second and Spear of shojin third Rune page consists of conqueror with presence of Mind tenacity and Last Stand run conditioning and overgrowth for secondaries a common theme among all three of the Solo Carry tops for this patch is that every single one has the ability to escape the island up in Top Lane Shen rounds out the top three and is such an incredibly reliable solo Q top laner two most common Shin matchups over the past few patches have been malphite and Scion and Shen is winning over 54 of the time against both the moored matchup is always one that can give Shen some issues so he's a good band to consider since Shen has the global impact with his ultimate he's able to run ignite instead of teleport this alone gives Shen such an edge up because if the enemy takes teleport they won't have the same all in power as Shen and if they take ignite they won't be able to match Shen's alt plays trading around W cooldown is very important for Shen to win out in Lane short trades around the spell to soften the enemy up and then going all in with Ignite will often surprise the enemy as most players don't really see Shen as his potent laning champ build for Shen is a heart steel Rush followed by Sunfire Aegis second and Titanic Hydra third as her runes roll with grasp Shield bash second wind and Revitalize for primaries best secondary page consists of cheap shot and ultimate Hunter a jungler whose playwright has more than doubled over the past few patches and is in an incredibly strong spot for solo queue is gragas now the Jarvan has been nerfed if you're looking for an alternative with excellent early gank power there's no better option than gragas you want to be super active throughout the early game with gragas ideally playing towards which lane provides the best gank setup if you can chain your CC with someone like Nautilus or thresh then there is no way the enemy is escaping your gank to learn more about executing ganks effectively the ganking masterclass course is a great in-depth resource to help you out so much of gragas's power in the mid game is from finding flash engage plays on enemy squishies so using your band on a good protector support like milio or Lulu is a good idea Knight Harvester is the optimal Rush item for gragas followed by Shadow flame second and ramadan's third run dark Harvest for the Keystone Rune with Sudden Impact eyeball collection and treasure hunter Tren and sentence and water walking are for secondaries whether you're looking for an assassin or a fighter jungler Kane is first in class for 13.8 and our second Solo Carry jungler with so many meta picks like Jarvan Lee sin Wukong falling in power the rise of Kane has been in full effect if you can Master both with Kane's forms he's such a powerful Champion to have in your Arsenal being able to adapt based on what the enemy team comp consists of is a great luxury to have collecting orbs and reaching form as fast as possible is always the main win condition for Kane when going blue Kane playing around Lanes with ranged characters is preferable while you want to be playing towards melee Lanes when going redkane Kane doesn't have the best early gank power so Banning out a jungler who does like Jarvan or hecarim will help Kane scale more reliably build for redkane as a quadrant could rush into Black Cleaver second and death stance third for blue Kane you'll want to run prowler's claw in combination with ghostblade and maname conqueror is the Keystone rune for redkane with Triumph tenacity and Last Stand followed by free boots and Cosmic insight for secondaries first strike is what you should run when playing blue Kane with free boots Futures market and Cosmic Insight best secondaries are Sudden Impact and ingenious Hunter rounding out the top three for Jungle is going to be echo echo has been a jungler on the rise in recent patches due to nasher's Buffs and with so many other junglers Nerf it's indirectly made him stronger as well magic wise for Echo both Kindred and kha'zix are good bad options as they do a really good job at shutting down echo's burst combo one of echo's massive strengths is his ability to look for pick plays that would otherwise be very risky for most Champs the whole enemy team can be grouped as five but if you have an angle onto the enemy priority Target it doesn't matter how many enemies are around as you can one shot your Target and ALT right back to safety setting up in fog of war and playing for these pick plays with W is how you're going to find great success in the mid game core build for Echo is a nasher's rush into rocket build second and ramadan's third grab first strike for the Keystone Rune with magical Footwear Futures market and Cosmic Insight optimal secondaries are Sudden Impact and treasure hunter one mid lane champ is very quietly made her way back to the top of the solo Q meta is Ari it was back in 13.4 when Ari saw a couple of Buffs and since since then her play rate has increased every single patch now the likes of aurelian soul and vegar are no longer dominating The Meta re slides by in priority and is a top tier solo Q mid Champs who have point-and-click damage are who Ari struggles against the most as she can't outplay them with her Mobility so Annie is a good ban option playing around our cooldown and changing how you posture based on whether the spell is available or not is vital to your success on Ari when R is up you should be constantly scoping out angles where the enemy squishy splits from their team giving you the opportunity to dive in and punish when it's down you gotta play more reserved looking for max range charm plays or just waiting until R comes back up this is why it's very important to run ultimate hunter in runes along with Transcendence and secondaries so you can get Ari r on as short a cooldown as possible build Ferrari consists of an Ever Frost rush into Shadow flame second and ramadan's third not a single Nerf to Annie for 13.8 so she will continue to be a free elo generator especially for the lower ranks it's actually really nice for Annie that picks like Ari and Katarina have seen massive player great spikes in recent patches as Annie's point-and-click damage nullifies their High Mobility kits super hard long range pick Champs that can catch any outside of her max range are good bands to consider so Lux or Fizz are good options the way Annie plays is often quite predictable as she has to run straight at the enemy and get relatively close up to dealer damage you want to eliminate as much of this predictability as possible by playing Andy more like an assassin setting up in Brush and catching targets out when they least expect it if you have any face Checks Into You there's quite literally no way for you to mess up on your combo and if the enemy does not see you they'll be dead before they can react playing arum with long range poke mid lane Champs is often the way to go but with Annie sieging mid is not how you're going to find Max success standard build for Annie is a loon's rush into Shadow flame second and ramadan's third electrocute is Keystone Rune with cheap shot eyeball collection and Relentless Hunter best secondaries are Mana flow and absolute Focus for the third and final Solo Carry mid of the patch we have fizz fizz is in a really solid spot right now due to recent direct Buffs and also with how the mid lane meta is is aligned Fizz is a monster of a counterterra alien Soul who has been consistently a highly played mid ever since his mini rework worst matchups for Fizz are Champs who can nullify his One-Shot power so Vladimir is one of the better bands for Fizz how you play the first three levels of the lane can make or break how successful you are with fizz give up if you CS if it means you avoid taking damage getting to level 3 with a few corrupting potion charges left is super important at three is where you look to play more aggressive looking to hard punish the enemy when they miss or waste cooldowns optimal build for Fizz is a luden's rush into lichbane second and zanya's or ramadan's third electrocutes the Keystone Rune with Sudden Impact eyeball collection and treasure hunter Triumph and coup de gras are for secondaries for the ADC top 3 there is nobody better than Jinx for 13.8 Zaya and Zary both being nerfed in recent patches has really opened things up for Jinx to rise as the unrivaled ADC get Jinx to two items in her team fight impact off passive resets is some of the best for any ADC finding that first reset in a team fight is super key to winning fights and and something you should be laser focused on with Jinx when paired with the melee support the chain CC power level 3 with flame Chompers is quite strong and where you can look to take control of the lane level 6 is where you can really get the ball rolling with jinx as her execute damage from R provides great follow-up on supports engages instead of banning another ADC you're banned when playing Jinx is generally best used on a meta engage Champion like malphite or Jarvan core build is a kraken Slayer rush into Infinity Edge second and Rapid Fire Cannon third roll with lethal Tempo is the Keystone followed by presence of Mind bloodline and coup de gras best secondary runes are absolute focus and Gathering storm not quite on the same level as Jinx but a very respectable ADC nonetheless is Zaya if Jinx and ziya are your two main adcs in your champion pool right now you're set up extremely well for 13.8 if there's one thing that ziya has the edge up compared to jinx is pure survivability into heavy dive comps it's not really just a jinx thing though any ADC without a Gap close feels bad into dive Champs but Zaya can weather the storm better than most due to her R if your last pick ADC in lobby and notice the enemy comp is hard dive even though Jinx is super strong in meta picking Zaya in that spot is often the better play playing around your R cooldown is vital to your success on xaya especially if you don't have flash available you really gotta change how you posture in team fights or you'll get blown up right away you can't go wrong with using your ban on Jinx right now with how prevalent she is in the current meta build for Zaya is a gale force rush into Quick blade second and a bloodthirster third lethal Tempo is the Keystone Rune with presence of Mind bloodline and coup de gras three boots and biscuits are the way to go for secondaries but for 13.8 and who will be without question the most sleeper op ADC is kogba despite Cog not being played very much in solo queue he has been one of the better performing adcs in recent patches with the buffs's patch more players should start to take notice of that the season 13 Meadow where you can take flash with ghost as Summoner spells works extremely well on Cog ghost popped in a team fight with the support like milio or Lulu by your side and you're actually very difficult to kill despite lacking a gap closer super hard engage is what Cog can struggle again against the most so using your ban on recon is a good choice blade of the ruined King into rageblade is the two item Spike you should be playing for the DPS potential on this core completion is super nuts and gives Cog one of the better mid game spikes third item really depends on the game as wits and shield bone hurricane are all great options the most popular Cog build doesn't even involve building a Mythic right now lethal Tempo is the optimal Keystone Rune with Triumph bloodline and Last Stand run conditioning and overgrowth for secondaries moving on to the top three for support first up is the recently released Emilio no enchanter support comes close to matching the power of milio right now Emilio's kit is absolutely insane and offers immense power when it comes down to enabling his carries with these hyper carries like Jinx and Kaiser being the most played adcs in solo queue it bodes extremely well for milio right now milio Q does a really good job at countering engage Champs however supports who can pick him off from long range are who can offer the most issues for that reason Banning blitzcrank is good value due to his relatively High play rate win condition for milio does not need to be overly complicated aided the protection the champ provides is ludicrous so sticking by whoever is most fed on your team and making sure they don't die is how you're going to be effective on Melia core build is Australia's rush into Arden sensor second and redemption or staff of flowing water third nothing beats Airy for the Keystone with Mana flow Transcendence and Scorch bone plating and Revitalize are what you should prioritize for secondaries thresh being battered down a bit by the recent 13.7 Nerf have given room for blitzcrank to emerge as the hook God down in bot Lane Jinx meta is super good for Blitz because the duo Synergy is amazing but at the same time if the enemy team picks Jinx Blitz is one of the better supports at punishing her lack of a gap closer you can never go wrong with a Morgana band when playing Blitz as her black shield makes catch plays less reliable the most obvious win condition for Blitz is to land as many hooks as possible but how can we increase our ability to do so playing around Side Lane brush using hex flash effectively and holding your hook for as long as possible are a few ways if you're looking to improve your laning phase as a support our Master minutes course just uploaded to our website last week will help you a ton bread and butter two atom core for Blitz is shiralius with Zeke's while Ward stone is great slotted in third you'll want to run glacial augment with hex flash biscuits and Cosmic insight for primary runes bone plating and flinchings are for secondaries in terms of a pure Solo Carry support in 13.8 there is nobody who comes close to rivaling Cena ever since those Buffs back in patch 13.4 Sam has been a top performer in the support meta Santa's kit is built to scale insanely well and stacking your souls to enable the scaling power should be of your utmost priority choosing optimal trade windows in lane and getting those Souls stacking is very important to get the most out of senna by acquiring a ton of Souls and hitting a few core items you can be as much of a damage threat as anyone on your team Senna struggles most against long-range catch Champions so either Lux or blitzcrank or who we would recommend Banning the build for Senna is an umbrell glaive rush into a clip second and Rapid Fire Cannon third Rune page revolves around Fleet for the Keystone with presence of Mind alacrity and cut down grab biscuits and approach velocity for secondaries alright guys before we wrap this up let's tell you a little more about skill cap so we offer a five division rank up guarantee and think that's a pretty crazy thing to offer it's like a gym membership guaranteeing you'll get ripped your local gym would go bust if they offered that right not us we've offered this for years because our service really does work it works so well in fact that we were able to produce by far the largest catalog of Premium League guides on the internet we add over 20 videos a week with over 1600 guides curated into over 100 courses no one can compare we've also sent Challenger players into ELO hell's 714 times and Counting where they commentate how to carry live they also respond to all questions asked sign up today for as little as 6.99 a month if you are serious about improving so there you have it guys the best solo carries for every single role in patch 13.8 thanks so much for watching good luck in solo queue and we'll catch you in the next one ","31":"if you click off this video You're trolling not only do we have a list of 10 Champions that will give you free low in 13.8 but we also have a link to one of the best applications I've ever seen made as a challenger coach like with these applications I normally tell students to uninstall them honestly but the OPG app easily the best one I've seen and I actually think it's useful for anyone playing this game in any single ELO because when you get in champ Stakes you can have the app choose the runes for you when you get in game as well the items that you choose that is also based off the most popular items built on those champions in higher levels of play and it's so easy to install and set up all you have to do is log in and connect your league account it's so easy and so quick and you will have this for eternity one of the things I really love as well that's kind of unique is that they have this op Champions page that updates every single hour so you can just go on to this and you can see that in every single ELO there are different op Champions because those elos change of course right so if you're diamond or above you can look at what's open diamond and above if your platinum you can have a look at what wins the most in Platinum same with gold silver bronze Etc I just think it's such a useful tool and if you guys don't install this like you are legit missing out because thousands of people are so all you have to do is click on one of those links in the description and comment section and you will know why the jizz absolutely Frost about this like I think this app is just so so good and it is a hundred percent gonna help you win games so if you want to get an edge on your competition this is the application you need to download right now super easy super quick and super freelo now starting off the countdown coming in a number 10 a champion you'll see a lot on that OPG app is Zaya whose band is still close to 20 of games picked on over 15 and still has over a 50 win rate in Platinum and above and this is where these stats are pull from guys platinum and above for this patch so most players are still having a lot of success on this Champion even those I did Culp a couple of nurse a few patches ago to her e right in terms of the damage and the cooldown it doesn't really matter too much because Zaya you're really picking her to counter all the Engage The Enemy team is picking now you can actually see as far as counter picks go Champions who don't really like hard engage on desire so who keep her in range actually really good against her so Champions like kogmore with his w ash is really good because you can keep her arranged Jinx exactly the same ride we see Jinx picked a lot against iron Pro play anything that actually Dives onto her is probably going to be bad that's why Champions like Samira for example as far as the Eddie carries go it's really not good to pick her into this feather chick but if we take it a step further and think about the rest of the rift we have Champions like nordlers blitzcrank being picked a lot Leona got buffed in this patch right Alice is getting picked a little bit more there is lots of engage and that goes for every single role in the game j4 is still pretty good karzix is on the up Cesar is just an amazing 80 car at the moment as far as the meta goes and she's strong enough to be in the top 10 Champions now coming in at number nine is one of those champers I actually just mentioned so if you want to play an assassin in the jungle and you're a fan of cockroaches I mean who isn't then kha'zix is one of the best junglers to pick and one of the most popular picked an over 12 and a half percent of games in close to 63 000 matches so far this patch in the last few days kha'zix players have close to a 52 win rate the extra damage you get from your q and I did kind of cool this actually kha'zix was going to be broken so well done to the jizz but yeah with the extra damage from your Q which is even more when they're isolated this has been massive for bug Splat this means that in the early game you're going to get more kills and especially by the time you hit Level 6 with like your serrated Dirk you can snowball game and if you know how to manipulate fog you know jungle timings and you can hit the enemy jungle on their camps as the stronger Champion when you get going in the early game you can snowball better than anything now so kha'zix I think he's in a great position because of the Buffs and he is number nine in the countdown because of the stats and how Willy's performing now coming in at number eight a champion who has the highest win rate guys out of these 10 Champions were about to mention he is a mid laner or top laner but the stats here are from mid lane action so if you need a bit of attack damage in the mid lane with insane priority because of his passive is to Auto attacks and his Q which can hit all six minions if you time it properly and it's good to pressure the enemy mid lane Champion with action is the champion for you you have so much pressure on this guy and because you have a variety of builds you can go like Kraken Slayer with sand there are probably builds out there with Shield bow maybe BT the max almost like survivability against dive compositions and because the meta again is very close range based action loves it this means you can actually get off your passive this means you can Auto attack multiple times because if you're against lots of range that's where the game gets tricky that's why you can see as far as counter picks go range Champions we have zeraph we have Talia we have Lux who can keep action at arm's length also Champions who like Champions who jump onto them so for instance Pantheon who can interrupt action's heroic swing exactly the same for vex and Swain is also really good because you can never really get close to him but still action is performing at an extremely high level with over a 54 win rate and over 16 000 games thus far in 13.8 coming into number seven guys is the second best 80 carry according to these stats and this is a guy who's Banning close to 20 of games he's one of the most banned ad carries and Champions on the rift this being Draven so in over 30 000 matches The Swinging ax of noxus has close to a 51 win rate because those changes to also Long Ago by going Essence River into Infinity Edge you deal the most damage in the early mid game out of any champion in the game I swear like you were one short people if they get caught out it's very obnoxious to play against and because of the matter at the moment it's more about engaged Champions Draven loves this this means you can get off more Auto attacks with your cues right and you can land both parts of your ultimate there is such a high chance of you catching in those adoration Stacks in the early game these days because of how volatile lanes are at the moment with those engaged supports so Draven as an ad carries probably the strongest Lane bully in the game right now so if you want to Stomp The Game and end it very quickly you have to pick Draven and put him in your Champion Port now champion who actually called well I didn't really think the nurse were going to do too much to him because yes your scaling might be affected in terms of you know your HP going down and your armor going down later into a game but the problem is this is that even if you are squishier just the fact that Champions have a really hard time of actually sticking to you and being on you because irelian soul in the mid to late game is still close to Untouchable in the majority of elos because for Rebellion Soul you're probably going to lose the game in the early game if you are going to lose the game that's why I kind of wanted the balance teams to like know if his early game even more so he's more vulnerable right because I think people can just blind pick this champion in most elos again and just get away with it there are lots of counters to this Champion Champions who can dive onto him and get in his face you can see the counter picks Christina jumping onto his head same with fears action Talon these Champions can put the pressure on him in the first let's just say like 11 levels and be like so far ahead that he will be irrelevant unless the game goes like 30 minutes that's what I thought they were going to do but these nurses patch haven't really changed too much yes he might die a couple more times but that's it your actual power spikes you're still holding on to and that's why railing Soul a 20 band raid still and he's still an S Plus tier Champion with over a 50 win rate and over 27 000 matches now starting off the top five the second best support according to the countdown this is Ryan's recent inclusion to the game this being milio now even though milio cops a couple of hot fix nurse a couple of patches ago when he got released hasn't really changed that much but despite those Nerfs even if we just look at the stats in over 62 000 matches to have close to a 51.5 win rate being picked in 12 and a half percent of games and banned in close to 17 that just says it all we don't even need to postulate about how the botland is going at the moment or The Meta if a champion has these stats they are just objectively broken that's why milio is number five now a bit like a running assault one she open who kind of got some Placebo nurse but honestly these nerves were actual Nerfs so for j4 players you are still somehow number four on this countdown but I think this is more to do with the fact this is really in Platinum and above so his win rate has actually dropped right because of the Nerfs especially your cubes-based damage going down this is important for you but he's still boasting a 51.5 win rate over that actually and to be picked as much as he is in over 10 percent of games and banned in over 21 that is actually the third highest ban rate in this list well I'm pretty sure he's gonna get nerfed again I think this Champion is still over performing to be picked this much to be as popular as he is and there's still be as strong I still think the descendant is gonna cop it once more but yeah keep picking him if he's open now number three the best support on the Riff right now this is a champion who well if you land one of your abilities you can just win Lanes from it and games as well in the mid to late game this of course is the crank Blitz crack so if you're running glacial augment pair this with your rocket grab and when you get to level 6 the amazing base damage in your ultimate which they buff towards the end of last season you're going to make Champions go boom and players go boom as well they will start tilting from this blitzcrank as well guys counters so many champions in the game right now even if we think of those 80 carries right there are some of mobile 80 carries Champions like Jinx like Draven even Zaya before level 6 is susceptible to a bit of blitzcrank action and he does so well against so many supports as well the supports you kind of need to be a little bit careful about other supports who wouldn't mind getting hurt so Champions like Tariq we have Brawn we have Leona right Rel but against a mobile bot Lanes especially those range Champions you destroy them and because they're still pretty popular blitzcrank is still gonna pop off for the rest of 13.8 now coming in at number two the best ad carry guys in the game right now I honestly can't believe she didn't get nerfed this of course is jinx by far the most popular champion in the game picked in over 154 000 matches that is 31 of games that is cracked like that's the highest I've seen for really ages to be honest and she'd banned an over 16 I really can't believe they're not nerfinger and I wouldn't even be surprised if they hot fixed nerfed her because it's well it's not breaking the game but yeah hopefully you catch my dresser right but this is just way too Op with over a 51 win rate she's classified as an S player state champion because of that and how much he's picked so Jinx is number two the bus recently especially to her attack speed have just made her really busted so she's number two now number one a champion who got changed in 13.8 is number one now this Champion if I just read out the stats for you let's see if you can guess who it is right so he's picked an over 47 and a half thousand matches that's over a nine and a half percent pick rate but he's bad I notice how I'm saying he here because I'm pretty sure it is he's banned at over 33 percent of games now he still has close to a 51 win rate he resides in the Top Lane and he did get nerfed in 13.8 this guy's of course is Rock Solid malphite and I thought this nurse weren't really going to do too much because you can kind of bypass them just by maxing your queue anyway and even going something like Comet even if you're still growing grass with a W Max it's really not that bad still into those close range Champions who you will Auto attack a lot and yeah malphite is just still innately broken I actually mentioned in one of our videos like the nurse and bust kind of like writer giving these champions in recent times anyway they're not really that severe they're actually quite nuanced and small so these champions in terms of win rate they're not going to change too much as we've seen with aurelian soul j4 malphite is just another one so malfi guys according to the win rates and the stats he is the number one Champion still in the game and yeah I wouldn't be surprised once again if there is some sort of whole fix to malphite jinx and j4 these three in particular so that was the countdown guys thank you so much for watching the video again remember to download that OPG app in the description comment section thank you so much for watching please hit that subscribe button so you don't miss any of our future season 13 content this has been the jizz bye ","32":"one tricking a champion or drastically limiting your champion pool is the best way to climb in ranked playing meta can be great but oftentimes meta Champions have super high band rates which make them difficult to one trick in today's video we'll be breaking down three champions for every single role that are amazing to one trick for patch 13.7 a few important pieces of criteria each champ in this video abides by is that they all have below 10 band rates but are still strong picks in meta despite Champs like malphite Emilio and Jarvan being very strong in meta they aren't the most reliable to one trick due to having high band rates so you won't see them recommended in this video but before we get into it be sure to check out skill cap if you want to truly get better at League of Legends we're the only service that offers a money back guarantee if you don't climb at least five divisions while actively using our service we do this because our service really does work and if it doesn't work for you you shouldn't pay learn more at the end of this video or click the link in the description below such an amazing top laner to one trick right now who has insane carry power when mastered is Camille Camille is only banned in two percent the games so she's a very accessible Champion cam is one of the few top laners that runs ignite with teleport so the early kill threat is incredible once you learn your limits if the enemy top laner does not take teleport you have such an easy win condition in this situation taking any even trade is actually a massively winning trade because you can just teleport back to Lane with full health and completely Zone the enemy due to your added kills threat with Ignite especially now that you can't use teleport for flying plays prior to 14 minutes using it to gain advantages like this in Lane is often the optimal way to use it the core build to run for Camille is a Divine sunderer rush into ravenous Hydra second and deathstance third grab grasp for the Keystone with Shield bash bone plating and unflinching magical Footwear and biscuits are for secondaries one of the most one-trick champions in the game and for good reason is Riven Riven is perfect to one trick right now because her band rate is very low at around one percent while she has a very high skill ceiling so the more time you put into her the more you're going to get out all the wall hop locations with q and the animation cancels to maximize damage output are not things you can master in just a couple the games due to riven's ludicrous Mobility you have some of the best potential to punish enemy mistakes in Lane this makes learning all your matchups very important to get the most out of Riven which will take a fair amount of games going even in Lane with Riven when the enemy picks utility tank is not going to cut it so obtaining leads through strong play in Lane is key optimal core build for Riven is ravenous Hydra rush into a clip second and Black Cleaver Third Run conqueror for the Keystone Rune with Triumph alacrity and Last Stand followed by Nimbus cloak and Transcendence for secondaries a champion that's not getting nearly as much attention as he should right now and arguably the best top laner to spam in Solo Q is Pantheon ban rate is only three percent so you're going to be able to play Pantheon in the majority of your games path may not be as mechanically intensive as the likes of Riven or Camille but that's not a prerequisite to be featured in this video the fact Pantheon is extremely strong in meta rarely banned and very easy to pick up means if you start one tricking him you're going to see great success relatively quickly if you don't have a ton of time to spend on mastering Riven or Camille then Pantheon is definitely the pick we would recommend you go with bully power in Lane is exceptionally strong especially after the recent Q cooldown Buffs poking melee Champs with Q when they go for last hits and then looking to all in with W when they get low enough is not all that difficult to pull off Top Lane being so isolated from the rest of the map often leaves you feeling quite useless when the action is elsewhere but with Pantheon's ultimate you can look to influence the map better than 95 percent of top laners once you get a basic understanding of your matchups constantly winning lane and then transitioning that lead across the map will have you winning a ton of games with pan build is an eclipse rush into Black Cleaver second and Spear of shojin third grab conqueror for the Keystone with presence of Mind tenacity and Last Stand conditioning and overgrowth are for secondaries the jungle meta has been shifting quite a bit in recent patches and won Champions come out on top and a really good one-trick option is Kane Kane has a band rate of seven percent right now so well below that 10 cut off we put in place in a way Kane is basically two champions in one as you have the option of playing red or blue King you could choose to just one trick a certain form but to get the most out of Kane choosing which form fits best for each game is insanely valuable since each form is a completely different play style Kane is not a champion you can just pick up and start winning with right away to begin seeing really good results on Kane it's going to take more time than your average jungler which makes him well worth it to one trick playing against a mastered blue cane player who can snowball effectively is probably one of the most tilting Champs to deal with especially if you're an ADC man build for Kane is Gore Drinker into Black Cleaver second and deathstance third if you're going redkane as for blue Kane a prowler's rush into ghostblade second and manamune third is extremely powerful conquer is the Keystone Rune when you are playing redkane while First Strike Works super well for blue cane there's really no better time to start one tricking Echo jungle than right now usually when Echo comes into meta his band rate skyrockets but right now it's only five percent recent Buffs to nashers have put him in a really good spot and in a great state to one trip our Challenger jungler Japanese import has a brand new full game commentary for echo on our website showcasing the power of nashers with echo's ultimate he's able to play much more aggressive with the lead than most junglers so learning the limits to Echo is key to your success dive plays the most junglers would not be able to pull off Echo can so adjusting accordingly and playing off echo's strength will take some time to get used to once you've got it down though Echo can be one of the most oppressive champions in the game with how aggro you're able to play knowing how much damage Echoes passive deals to Baron at every stage of the game will also take your Echo to another level Echo passive with Smite combo can deal a ridiculous amount of damage so being able to consistently steal objectives will give you so many comeback wins build for Echo is an Asher's tooth rush into rocket belt second and robidon's third run first strike for the Keystone with magical Footwear Futures market and Cosmic Insight eyeball collection and treasure hunter are for secondaries for our third jungle selection to round out the top three is going to be Fiddlesticks fiddle checks our boxes for a great one-trick jungler as he's only banned in three percent of games and is super strong for solo queue playing against the fiddle one trick feels like you have no room to breathe especially when he gets level 6 as the pressure he provides from Ultimate is incredibly strong both Kane and Echo are excellent skirmishing junglers but if you're looking for that monster team fight pick then fiddle is the way to go with one good are you can completely shift the momentum of a game so being able to find those openings is how you're really going to master fiddle it's not so much about the mechanics of the fiddle it's more so about being in the right place at the right time so setting up for objectives before they spawn and picking the enemy team off as they walk in is something you can play for each game build for Fiddlesticks is a rocket Bell rush and lasagna second and void staff or Shadow flame third first strike is the Keystone Rune with perfect timing Futures market and Cosmic Insight best secondaries include cheap shot and ultimate Hunter there's a reason Kiana's win rate absolutely moons in High ELO and it's because of how powerful she is once mastered band raid of Kiana is the lowest we've seen in the video thus far at only one percent her power level is actually very solid though at the moment not overly op or anything but in a phenomenal spot to one trick one trick Keanu players are a nightmare to play against as their ability to one shot a priority Target in a split second keeps everyone on their toes utilizing Kiana's invis to its fullest potential is also something that makes her extremely broken properly executing a One-Shot combo and then going in viz to stall for your team to follow up will lead to insane impact for solo queue Kiana can look to abuse the exact same build as Kane going Prowlers into ghostblade which amplifies pick power massively if you see an enemy squishy pushing up too far this two item combo is the best in the game to punish positional mistakes Rune page consists of electrocute with Sudden Impact eyeball collection and treasure hunter roll with presence of mind and last stand for secondaries if you're looking for more of a lane dominant mid lane pick then there's really nobody better than auction right now van rate is hovering around four percent so auction is a very accessible Champion there's a massive gap between an average and mastered auction player as the way they use their e is drastically different understanding how to use auction e in all types of scenarios has a very high skill ceiling which makes spending a ton of time on him well worth it if you can learn the limits of auctions e and understand your lane matchups then snowballing with this champ becomes incredibly easy stealth from W and long range Gap clothes from E gives auction some of the best Roam and pick power for any Midland Champion when you have a lead the enemy is never safe farming a side wave as you can just sneak up with your stealth pop out right in front of their face and they've got no way to escape due to the range on your E standard build for auction is a kraken Slayer rush into blade of the ruined King's second and wits and Third Run press the attack with presence of Mind alacrity and coup de gras for primary runes optimal secondaries are shield bash and Bone plating if 80 mid laners are not up your alley and you'd rather side with one tricking an AP mid then Fizz is the perfect pick this was just buffed a few patches back putting him in a great spot for solo queue while having a band rate of just four percent Fizz has so much outplay potential in his kit with the mobility from q and E so when you can play The Champ to his limits he can look like the most broken champ to exist first two levels are definitely where Fizz can be exploded the most so being able to master giving up as little as possible before hitting level 3 is key to getting the most out of Fizz consistent R hit rate is also something that won't come super easy so one tricking Fizz and getting your reps in is vital for maximizing success in the champ the core build for Fizz is a luden's rush in designing second and lichbane third Rune page is electrocute with Sudden Impact eyeball collection and Treasure Hunter Run Triumph and coup de gras for secondaries it was a long time coming but vayne is finally back in a solid spot for solo queue and a really good 80c to one trick with a band rate of just five percent you're going to be able to one trick vein very reliably right now of course there's the mechanical side of things that goes into playing a great vein but the way you play the early laning phase is just as important it's no secret vayne's early levels are where she's most vulnerable so learning your matchups and finding ways to come out of Lane even or ahead is what really makes a great Bane player when you first start playing Bane don't expect it to be pretty she's definitely got a higher learning curve than most adcs but once you put the time in she has some of the best Solo Carry power for any ADC Build for vain is a shield bow rush into rageblade second and blade of the ruined King third take lethal tempo for the Keystone with triumphalacrity and coup de gras Taste of blood and treasure hunter are for secondaries flipping the switch to quite the polar opposite of vein for our second ADC selection is Tristana one tricking Tristana is extremely worth it as learning the limits of the champion gives you immense snowball power in Lane knowing when you can dive in with w and look to assassinate the enemy team is such a valuable tool to have it can definitely be a double-edged sword though as is miscalculating your damage and losing out on the duel can make it look like you're ending with so many of these aggro supports being played in meta like thresh Recon Nautilus and Blitz it makes trist even more worth it to one trick in 13.7 build for Tristana is a kraken Slayer rush into Quick blade second and bloodthirster third take Halo Blaze for the Keystone Rune with Taste of blood eyeball collection and treasure hunter Triumph and bloodline are the best secondaries to complete the trifecta for ADC and who you could argue is the better version of vayne right now is Kaiser despite kais being played quite a bit in meta she's only being banned in two percent of games Kaiser is 100 reliant on her damage to be effective as she offers no utility for her team so being mechanically proficient is a must to see good results on The Champ you can still be effective on an ADC like MF Ash or sivir with very limited games but the same can't be said about kaisa spending the time to one-trick Kaiser and learning the limits of the champ will significantly increase your carry potential honor more specifically getting used to how you should be using your ultimate to either dive in or kite away is something that takes a lot of trial and error to truly master Kaiser Knowing When To Go full throttle and dive the back line is key but you're bound to end a few times in the process of learning build for Casa is a kraken Slayer rush into phantom dancer second and quickblades third lethal Tempo is the Keystone Rune with presence of Mind bloodline and coup de gras Run free boots and biscuits for secondaries an absolutely amazing support to one trick kicking off the top three is Recon with a band rate of just five percent you'll have no issues spamming your con right now the play-making potential Recon provides makes him so rewarding when you have him mastered there's no other support with the same kind of instant long-range catch power that rakan has a Recon that knows when to pull the trigger and find those catch plays can have incredible impact on games there's a very fine line that takes a while to learn though as oftentimes you'll see a nice engage opportunity dive in but your team is nowhere near in range to capitalize and you end up overextending honing that aggression and knowing when it's time to strike will make your recon look like the most OP support which is why he's very worthwhile in one trip build for Khan's Australia's rush into Redemption second in wardstone third pick up Guardian for the Keystone with font of Life bone plating and unflinching zombie Ward and ultimate Hunter are for secondaries one supporter becomes infinitely better when in the hands of a one trick is Senna senna's ban rate is only three percent so you rarely have to worry about not being able to play her most support Champions make their worth from Landing Cc or protecting their carries but Senna is an outlier being a consistent DPS source for your team is a big part of how you impact games with Senna so being mechanically sound at her is super important positioning and kiting are way less vital on the majority of supports while you can't get away without them on Cena the carry power on Senna is amazing when you know what you're doing but you can't expect to see results right away which makes her great to one trip standard core build for Senna is an umbral glaive rush into a clip second in Rapid Fire Cannon third the Rune Pages Fleet with presence of Mind alacrity and cut down followed by bone plating and Revitalize as a support Champion who's 100 reliant on Landing skill shots to be effective Lux is an excellent support to one trick bandra is just four percent for Lux so she will be consistently available for you to play everything comes down to Landing consistent binds with Lux and if you can do that on a regular basis she can impact games better than most supports you're going to build Lux full AP and BL legitimate carry threat so you've got to land your damage to make an impact Lux being a very squishy and vulnerable support lacking a gap closer means your positioning needs to be on point and you can't afford to misstep like you can on other supports the build is a luden's rush into Shadow flame second in ramadan's third for runes role of comet Mana float Transcendence and Scorch followed by cheap shot and ultimate Hunter for secondaries alright guys before we wrap this up let's tell you a little more about skill cap so we offer a five division rank up guarantee and think that's a pretty crazy thing to offer it's like a gym membership guaranteeing you'll get ripped your local gym would go bust if they offered that right not us we've offered this for years because our service really does work it works so well in fact that we are able to produce by far the largest catalog of Premium League guides on the internet we add over 20 videos a week with over 1600 guides curated into over 100 courses no one can compare we've also sent Challenger players into ELO hell's 714 times and Counting where they commentate how to carry live they also respond to all questions asked sign up today for as little as 6.99 a month if you are serious about improving so that's gonna wrap everything up for this one thank you all so much for watching good luck on the rift and we'll see in the next one ","33":"13.8 is heavily focused around Champion changes as there are 16 of them locked in the one item change is pretty massive though as Cosmic Drive will be getting another alteration with the help of our Challenger players and analyzing the most recent data we are set to bring you guys a complete update on the solo Q meta for patch 13.8 but before we get into it be sure to check out skill cap if you want to truly get better at League of Legends we're the only service that offers a money back guarantee if you don't climb at least five divisions while actively using our service we do this because our service really does work and if it doesn't work for you you shouldn't pay learn more at the end of this video or click the link in the description below kicking things off with the cosmic Drive changes we are going to be seeing its ability power increase from 90 to 100 a new passive will be added replacing the old one where dealing damage generates a stack of 2.5 movement speed every 1.5 seconds for the next 5 Seconds up to a Max of 10 movement speed at 4 Stacks at Max Stacks you will gain an additional 10 movement speed so 20 in total these changes are going to open things up for Cosmic drive to be way more viable on a wide array of Champions with the old passive you had to burn three separate attacks to Prock its passive so the item was rather mediocre on burst Champions one thing we have to keep in mind here though is that the item is now super movement speed heavy as you won't be gaining the bonus ability power when it Max stacks of the passive 20 movement speed is pretty nuts though and for these shorter range Mages that need to be spacing immaculately in fights like ryze and Cassiopeia they should be loving these alterations Gwen is another one to watch for sure as her kiting potential will be crazy for pics like Vlad and Silas we're leaning more towards this new cosmic Drive being less favorable for them since Silas already has great Mobility from W and E he would rather have the added AP from old Cosmic than the move speed from new cosmic we will be sure to keep you guys updated in the coming patches if any new champs pop up that are super good with Cosmic drive after decimating the Top Lane meta for multiple patches in a row we finally have a round of malphite Nerfs W First Auto Attack Base damage is going from 30 scaling to 90 to 30 scaling to 70. WQ leave armor ratio is also down from 20 to 15 percent two Nerfs that aim to lessen the power of w Max malphite which has been His Highest win rate spell to Max in previous patches to be fair though Q Max malphite is still completely viable as well it's just that W Max was insanely broken if you're going for qmax now this change is extremely insignificant so overall we can't see malphite falling out of meta as a result of these Nerfs malphite was the Lone op pick on the top Lane tier list for 13.7 so with this Nerf we'll be leaving him there but adjusting a few Champions up who will be on the same level as him now Garen has been a pretty weak Top Lane performer in recent patches so a few minor Buffs are headed his way base ad is going from 66 to 69 base armor is up as well from 36 to 38 nothing too over the top here but a couple of nice Buffs that will solidify Garen as a good a tier top laner one very underrated top laner who doesn't necessarily need Buffs but is likely receiving them because Riot wants people to know the champ still exists is Poppy Q percent Health damage is going from eight to nine percent W bonus resistances are being increased from 10 to 12 percent poppy does extremely well meta against highly picked Champs like Jace Jax Riven and Fiora so don't be sleeping on her in 13.8 the fact poppy actually has solid matchups right now combined with these Buffs lead us to pushing poppy into the Top Lane s tier for 13.8 having a look at the complete Top Lane tier list we have malphite Pantheon and Shen as the three op carries as we mentioned earlier despite the malphite Nerfs he will remain a great Top Lane pick just not miles ahead of everyone else hence the movement of Pantheon and Shen into op pant is an extremely strong pick for both top and mid so if you're someone who cues for both roles Manning path is insanely good right now if you're a Gwen player definitely look into Cosmic drive for 13.8 the added movement speed will be pretty ridiculous for a champion that deals as much consistent DPS as Gwen the best top laners to climb little ELO the fastest are Yorick malphite and nasus Fiora Darius and malphite are three of the most optimal Top Lane bands coz exchanges from last patch undershot in the eyes of Riot so he will be getting a buff in 13.8 Q damage will be increased by 10 at all ranks not a super massive buff but one that we see being enough to give kha'zix the nudge up into s tier a couple of Lilia Buffs are on the way with her monster damage cap going from 50 scale to 150 to 70 scale into 150. monster healing is up as well from 24 scaling to 75 to 39 scaling to 54. AP ratio is going from 5 to 15 Champion healing is also being adjusted from 6 scaling to 120 to 6 scaling to 90 with the AP ratio going from 18 to 30 percent in combination with these direct Buffs it will be really interesting to see how the new cosmic Drive fits in on Lilia Lilia already gains a ton of move speed from hitting her spells so add-on Cosmic drive and the slipperiness of the champ will be ludicrous all in all these Buffs are not overly impactful but Lilia will be slotting in as a good eight-tier jungle pick in 13.8 a few base stat Buffs are lined up for nidalee with her base armor going from 28 to 32 while her armor growth is up from 4.7 to 5. four base armor is actually not that bad and will definitely help nidalee stay a bit healthier throughout her clear and in skirmishes definitely a buff that will impact High ELO more significantly as the early game is way more important and getting that extra armor will bolster nid's early power like most of the previous changes though this buff won't significantly Propel nidalee into meta for the majority of ranks and we will be leaving her in the jungle a tier for a champion that has been the most OP pick in the entire game for multiple patches in a row we definitely expected a little more out of these Jarvan Nerfs Q damage is down by 10 at all ranks and his 80 growth is going from 3.4 to 3. Riot did note that they don't want to see a drastic shift in meta heading into MSI and these Jarvan changes definitely won't push him out of meta similar to the previous malphite changes we see Jarvan remaining in op carry just now on the same level as a few other solo q junglers a few minor Nerfs to Kane are penciled in this patch with his shadow form e cooldown being increased from eight to nine seconds Shadow e bonus movement speed is down as well from 80 to 70 percent pretty insignificant changes in the grand scheme of things and they don't even hit red Kane at all so we expect his overall power level to remain in a good spot for 13.8 and we'll be leaving him in the jungle s tier jungle tier list looks quite similar to last patch with a few Champs shuffling around due to Jarvan being nerfed he will no longer have control the optier as fiddle and Evelyn will be moving back up to join him one jungler to watch in 13.8 more commonly played in The Top Lane but just as much of a threat in the jungle is Poppy Buffs are great for poppy Jungle 2 and she's such an underrated answer to meta junglers like Lee sin and Jarvan poppy is such a great pocket pick to have available and if you want to learn more about her our Challenger jungler BMX specs has a brand new full game commentary for you guys on our website the low Hilo gods of jungle dispatch are Fiddlesticks mordekaiser and Jarvan highest on our ban list include Evelyn Kane and Jarvan aurelian Soul has continued to dominate solo queue in recent patches especially in the lower ranks so Riot has a few Nerfs to combat his power level both changes are scaling Nerfs to his health and armor growth which are aimed at reducing the Champ's power more so for the lower ranks where games drag out much longer the theme around most of the changes this patch have been that they're all quite filler and don't actually do a whole lot and that's what we're expecting here once again aurelian soul will not be moving anywhere on the mid lane tier list sticking an a tier for 13.8 that smaller alien Nerf is literally the only mid lane change for 13.8 if you don't count the cosmic Drive adjustment as a result the op tier remains intact with Annie and Pantheon leading the way the main focus around 13.8 for mid lane will be which Champions end up the biggest winners from the cosmic Drive adjustments who knows maybe the changes won't actually do anything and the item will continue to be super Niche but hopefully we get some new item paths that emerge let us know who you think will come out on top in the comments below best low ELO mid laners for 13.8 are vegar malzahar Nanny Annie Zed and Fizz are who we see as the highest priority mid lane bands let's move on to breaking down the ADC changes first up starting with Ezreal base ad is going from 60 to 62. buff will likely add about one percent to ezreal's overall win rate but that won't be enough to push him back into the solo queue meta as it will remain in the ADC B tier for 13.8 in ADC that will probably never fully come back into meta but who Riot will be pushing for in 13.8 is kog'maw passive damage is up from 125 scaling to 550 to 140 scaling is 650. Q cooldown is being reduced from 8 to 7 Seconds e-mana cost is down from 60 scale 200 to 40 scaling to 100. finally East slow is up from 20 scale into 52 to 30 scaling to 50 at first glance you may Ponder at whether apcog could make a comeback due to these Buffs but we can't really see it e-power is going to be the exact same at Max Rank and it's the spell you max out first on apcog so although his early game will be slightly stronger the mid to late game will be exactly the same ADC Cog on the other hand will be liking these Buffs a little more as e was buffed at rank 1 and it's the spell he maxes out last despite his low play rate Cog really hasn't been a terrible ADC in recent patches and as a result of these Buffs he's going to be a really great Ester option moving forward ADC tier list is looking quite similar to last patch with Jinx staying on top as the number one solo Q ADC the best low ELO bot Lane carries a Tristana Misfortune and vegar as they're all very simple to play but very effective at the same time with Jinx being as prominent and meta as she is she's the best ADC band right now while Zaya and Draven are two other worthwhile options as well Alistair has got to hold some sort of record for most amount of changes in a single season as he's being buffed again in 13 28th this time his R duration is going from 7 to 8.5 seconds Riot continues to chip away and give Alistar these very minor Buffs in hopes that they finally add up and push him into meta this change will Propel him closer to Sierra but we don't see it being enough to push him up so we'll be leaving the cow in a tier for 13.8 a support that definitely does not need Buffs right now but will receive three of them in 13.8 is Jonah W damage is being increased by 10 at all ranks AP ratio on W is up from 50 to 60 percent e Decay delay is up from 1.25 to 2.5 seconds this e-change is actually kind of sad to see because even though it's a buff it kind of removes a bit of the skill expression that goes into playing genre now that the Decay delay is 2.5 seconds you can be a lot less precise with your timing of the spell and it gives your ADC a longer window where they can look to trade these honestly might be the most impactful Buffs of the entire patch for a champ that doesn't even need Buffs in the first place and we will be seeing Jonah back in the S tier as a result Leona has been a very mediocre support for a long time now so a few Buffs are being issued this patch w bonus armor and Magic resist is being increased by 10 at all ranks while W magic damage is also up by 10 in all ranks without Leon has been performing in previous patches these Buffs will make her good support for 13.8 but nothing more than that which lands her a spot in the a tier and the final support change this patch is going to be a champ who's in much need of a Nerf being rakan a bit disappointing to see the nerves are very light though with his base armor going from 32 to 30 and armor growth down from 5.1 to 4.9 that's the story of this patch isn't it another set of changes that don't actually do anything in Shifting the Champion's power level as a result Recon will maintain his op tier status in 13.8 looks like Riot is trying to milk as many skin sails as they can at Emilio as he will continue dominating the support meta alongside rakan Senna and blitzcrank the optimal low ELO carries from the support role include milio Annie and Zyra Annie and Zyra are both amazing pure carry options while milio is the Premier protector support as for the support bands were Khan thresh and milio are all great options due to how much they're being played in the current matter alright guys before we wrap this up let's tell you a little more about skill cap so we offer a five division rank up guarantee and think that's a pretty crazy thing to offer it's like a gym membership guaranteeing you'll get ripped your local gym would go bust if they offered that right not us we've offered this for years because our service really does work it works so well in fact that we're able to produce by far the largest catalog of Premium League guides on the internet we add over 20 videos a week with over 1600 guides curated into over 100 courses no one can compare we've also sent Challenger players into ELO hell's 714 times and Counting where they commentate how to carry live they also respond to all questions asked sign up today for as little as 6.99 a month if you are serious about improving so there you have it guys complete look at the solo queue meta for every single role as we head into patch 13.8 thank you all so much for watching good luck on the rift and we'll see in the next one ","34":"oh what's up game leapers this is eggs and in today's video the 20 Champions that are most broken right now for every single ELO so this is across all Rags this is every bit of data we have this is in like millions of matches around the world right so we can't really go wrong can we these are going to be the 20 best guys and I don't want any arguing mate of course you can argue it's not really going to be that accurate for every single ELO but anyway yeah let's get into the fast food video oh yeah just before we do check out the game with website guys I'm sick of saying this every single video you guys are not going to improve by watching this video so in the next 10 minutes you're still going to be the same dummy you were at the start of this video and so will I I'm not gonna learn anything maybe there might be some like surprising win rates and ban rates and you know number of matches but why does that mean anything to your improvement what will is actually learning the game fundamentally right back timings wave management how you position and Lane how you space counting cooldowns all of these things are going to help you improve so much more we have all the learning resources you need on a website at gameweb.com get signed up get exclusive access to our library of content and yeah let's get into the 20 Champions coming in at number 20 and he is Misfortune played in close to 600 000 matches and to have over a 51 win rate as plus their Champion picked an almost 13 of games as well and not really bad too much she's a solid pick in most elos now she does very well against a lot of ball ladies because lots of Bot Lane is 80 carries are a mobile so MF especially if you're going something like lethality MF and we've talked about that build recently where you can go like dust blade axiomark it's actually really fun to do and kind of toxic in a way but yeah bunch of builds with MF even crack inside collector right because humax is well maybe objectively better than going like lethality but yeah MF is number 20. now staying in the bot Lane number 19 is vain and because of the bust this patch in 13.6 vein has just been off chops in the last few days and yeah for vain because your passive has received like just a 50 buff that's kind of absurd your Q is dealing more damage your W as well as dealing with damage early game and you're maxing your Q first for the most part and even though lethal Tempo might have got nerfed it's the same for every 80 carry so vayne you don't really have to worry too much about this and yeah vein does very well against a lot of Champions because that's really just how her kit is if you're playing around the top playing I'm sure it's the same thing So Vain is here 10 pick rate a bit less than MF but she is banned more so that's why she's a little bit High despite having a slightly lower win rate now moving into the jungle one of the more popular junglers here at 8.2 percent this is Wukong so guys if you need some sort of attack damage jungler and you need someone to dive into the enemy backline Wukong is an excellent choice he's still being pretty much picked and bad well maybe not bad but he's been pixel on in Pro Play Still and I wouldn't be surprised if we see some sort of Wukong Nerf in the near future because he's been picked for patches now at the highest level but even across the board right in over 375 000 matches to have close to a 52 win rate still in that many games it goes to show how good the Monkey King is now heading back down to the bowling the next best idea you carry according to the stats coming in at number 17 we have Jin picked in close to 14 of matches and he does have a higher win rate than Vayner Misfortune just above 51.2 percent now for gin I don't actually think he's like that amazing of a champion at the moment because there are just lots of AD carries who are maybe stronger and his laning place isn't really like scary enough to put pressure on those Champions but I guess the good thing for Jim right now is the meta supports right who are engaged and because as Jin you liking guys Champions because it means you can land your deadly flourish you can land your curtain calls of course the Gin on your team won't do any of that but yeah for Jin generally speaking that is good news so jyn is number 17 pretty easy Champion to Pilot and make work which also helps him now moving into the jungle for the next two picks coming in at number 16 is the ultimate low ELO champion this being Master you can see this guy even though he's probably not like the strongest jungler in the world right now he's still banded over 20 percent of games and still picked a lot close to nine percent to have close to 400 000 matches over a 50.3 percent win rate the wuju placement has to be here now beating him to number 15 is another jungle who doesn't really pop off that much in high reloads but I can see why he's so effective in lower elos this being Nocturne right and for North turn if you're going something like stride breaker go Drinker I don't know like Eclipse dustblade you've got a few builds there and whatever build you go it's just the fact that yeah lots of people aren't going to actually jungle against you properly when you play Nocturne and you'll still actually a very good early game skirmisher so even if you do get invaded it's not the end of the world porn I'm making here though is you're going to get to level 6 most of the time for your charge when you get to level six Lots Elena's just aren't aware of that timing lots of ladies aren't aware of where you are on the map anyway if you're a jungler so yeah no turn because you can really make use of just people making mistakes he's number 15. moving back to the bottling first support guys on this countdown is Lux and for Lux look at these stats for me 15 pick rate that's really high for a support 16 ban rate that's also really high if we think about it was lucky so I picked this much because Caitlyn really isn't that good anymore Caitlyn cop nurse right bass armor they say they went down and her win rate has dropped like two three percent because of it and you're picking likes really because of Kate of course you can pick her to counter enemy Champions right you can even pick it with something like lethality Varys works very well but yeah in these lower elos likes to have close to a 51 win rate and that's in close to 700 000 matches and dear me what are these people doing in lower elos guys if you see a lux picked piglets rank or something pick something that's going to dive onto it or just like out Ranger rather maybe a zerath is really good into it blitzcranker MooMoo something that can really dive into it that's what you want to pick against Champion stop letting her get away with murder because it should not work like this moving to the Top Lane number 13 the first hole player is allowing and for allowing ever since really like Riot buff Black Clover right I know this is like for the majority of elos and even if they didn't buff Black Cleaver in turns the HP and AD a few patches ago alawi would probably still be here because for lots of people she's just really hard to play into right because you can never really go into her as any Champion but there are some hard battles right those spell casting champions in the Top Lane so look at the counter picks for me Yorick with his e water Kaiser because of your Q she can never really pull you in and when you press R you take her out of all her tentacles Teemo range KO range vein range sends you can cut and cyan because you're a spellcaster as well right so the Russian Champions who do very well into allow it but because you're such a good split Pusher ride and because like yeah you're gonna get fired pretty much in every single game she can be a big nuisance to deal with and she's number 13 banned in 16 of games as well by the way so clearly lots of top laners think she is one of those demons now number 12 moving back down to the bot Lane and lots of 80 carries here by the way guys now coming in at number 12 is Samira even though she she kind of got like hard Nerf recently I mean they kind of like semi-reverted her passive right but she's still like spinning around like a Beyblade and one-shotting everyone and getting Penta kills more than any other champion and yeah that's why she's banned an over 22 percent a game still even if like statistically she did get worse it's just that people feel as if this Champion the desert rose is still too strong and has too much counter play against too many champions in the ball Lane it's kind of lucky that you have Zaya who kind of wrecks this Champion who's strong right now and there are other Champions range Champions like Jinx might do well into her right because Samira should never really be able to like jump onto you unless you're playing against like in a Mumu or something really comes down to the support there but yeah Samira is here regardless of what I say these are what the stats say a 7.3 pick rate and to have over a 50 win rate she's number 12. now number 11 is another supporter we don't really see too much in irelos you know you might see a pick specifically into something like a thresh into a blitzcrank right but Morgana in lower elos but Morgana and lower ELO's like look at the number of matches for me 371 000 matches now not every single one of these games is Morgana being picked into a Thresh or a blitzcrank right some people are just going to be picking up just to play more Ghana they won't be thinking about the team composition so it really just again goes to show how good this shampoo is because even if you do pick on it's a bad matchup bot Lane because of your black shield it's such a strong spell you land one dark binding your ultimate's really good against Close Quarter teens right and lots of teams right now are going to be engaged teams because that's just how the matter is right now right so Morgana is a very good champion and just an excellent Champion to have in your support pool she has over a 50 win rate and she's number 11. now moving into the top ten we're moving back into the jungle here and even though ram ram got nerfed ramus the armadillo is here at number 10 of 53.17 win rate at the moment anyway and he's banded over 10 of games now I don't know why this Champion is banned this much what I kind of do is because people don't know how to Jungle against him properly or if you see a rammers please try to pick AP Champions yet because he's all about armor funnily enough being called the armadillo but yeah Ramesses here because he can just punish pretty much any mistake you make quick and then anyone else you know knocked on at level six is the same Vibe so ramus being here kind of makes sense I think he's a lot worse than what he was and you should be able to play against them if you know how to Jungle properly which we can teach you on our website I've coached jungles to rank one of the US sign up learn the knowledge now number nine is vegan mid lane Vega bot Lane is also on this countdown spoiler alert he's number six but Faker in the mid lane I don't even know why I gave that away but yeah vegar in the mid lane guys because you counter so many champions and it's not even mid lane like I don't care if you're against aurelian Soul something at range right like maybe a ziggs or a Zera something you can jump onto and ruin your day like a Katarina who can avoid your cage I don't care you are going to counter lots of Champions the enemy team picks you could be against a Katarina but you could be against a Samira and like an Alistair bot Lane all you have to do is just drop your cage around them you might be against a very close range top laner and jungler like they might have maybe a Wukong they might have something like a Darius top right these Champions you just put your cage around them they're kind of screwed right this is the power of Vega also going something like everfrost you have crown of the shattered queen as an option right this Champion is still very good in the mid lane but you have to pick him into the right circumstances right so if they have a bunch of range please don't pick Vega anyway guys moving on to number we have the newest champion on the rift this being milio and four milio to have over a 22 pick rate 24 ban rate even after he got whole fixed Nerf this bad boy is still popping off and that's an over a million matches he is one of two Champions on this list with over a million matches and yeah over a 50.3 percent win rate he's got to be here right I just recommend again because this dude is an enchanter trying to pick something that can catch him out like a blitzcrank or just keep him at range Bill calls Santa will do really well right seems really free sent her into any enchanter is really good so think about picking them into milio now moving back to the Top Lane I talked about this counter pick as a counter to allowing this is mordekaiser now in high reloads he does struggle because people have their monitors turned on and they move laterally lots of people in lower e let's just move backwards and forwards the statue 8.3 pick rate a 52 win rate in his band a lot which again all players think this dude is just annoying to go against his heart to beat it kind of makes sense that he's number seven here now number six I kind of gave it away this is Vega right in the bot Lane guys and in the ball Lane even though you got Nerf this patch and turns your base HP your base armor went down but here's the thing your base armor can be zero like I'm being serious your base armor can be zero you can still be the best AP carry bot Lane Champion maybe even best bot Lane champion in the game because your W's ranging Q range got buffed a few patches ago this means you can Farm safely you're not gonna get hit by anything it doesn't matter if your base armor is note by like three or five or seven or ten whatever they want to do to you doesn't matter baby Gandalf can stay at range in Q and stack and scale effectively also the engage matter is amazing for Vega like I said close range fighting that's what this guy wants Vega bot Lane definitely think about having a manual champion pool now this Champion if you are an ID carry should be on your pool regardless this is jinx regardless of what the enemy team picks that is and yet for drinks over 23 pick rate 51.4 percent win rate she's number five I'm kind of surprised she's not actually high with these stats so yeah and that's an over a million matches as well so Jinx is number five guys if you don't have her in your champion pool like I just said you're trolling bro now number four staying in the bot Lane the best support Guys across every single ELO and we even talked about him recently in the top 10 like Korean champions in High ELO this is blitzcrank and blitzcrank has a 26.6 ban rate in the other video about the top 10 Korean champions in high yellow blitzkraine had close to a 50 he's actually banned more in Korean High ELO than he is in like bronze silver naeus Etc that just speaks volumes to how like kind of annoying this Champion is he counted so many champions like if you're a support you're probably gonna think oh blitzcrank counters me and the next support thinks are blitzcrank count as my Champions he just does so well against so many things right if it's an enchanter if it's something like a thresh right you get hooked once you're just gonna get blown up really annoying to play against so I can see why he's banned a lot awesome Champion to have guys in your pool to counter pick and punish those guys who are just blind picking support without thinking about the crack now number three malphite top plane now whether you're matching your W first or whether you're maxing your Q with comment don't really care to be honest get a frostfire gauntlet you're gonna one short people with just Auto attacks now because the boxer came into your W and for mouth that's really been it guys he does very well against a lot of Champions right just be careful about picking this guy if they have a lot of AEP on their team because you're picking malphite kind of like Ramos but armor if you're against something with attack speed or just attack damage in the Top Lane you're going to do very well but against Tanki Champions you can see here the counter picks like Mundo like cyan like Mordecai's or singe or choga most of these are AP and a champion especially like Silas you're gonna get dumpstered bro but yeah he will still work in close to half a million matches over a 52 close to 53 win rate pick Rock Solid this patch number two is j4 52.7 Win rate very close to mouth right in terms of pick rate as well 10.7 close to half a million matches this dude is kind of insane right now even though their nerfed his W ride so in terms of the cooldown and the 80s scaling hasn't really like meant anything for j4 because the bus a few passes ago were too big and yeah we're seeing him picked a lot in Pro play again and he's just dominating solo queue across the board so he is the number one jungler and the number two Champion overall but he is best it by the number one champion in the game and that is the spot Nerfs that came in well I don't even know like the last one two three patches to aurelian Soul this guy has a 40 ban rate in every single ELO guys he's 100 gonna get nerfed again like there's no way rider gonna allow a champion to have a 40 band rate and over a 51 and a half percent win rate it's just not healthy for the game nor the people playing Ireland Soul like you guys who are playing Soul before these changes I kind of feel sorry for you because it's hard to pick him now without him being banned so much but yeah he is the number one Champion guys according to the data that we have in 13.6 thus far thank you so much for watching the video if you did enjoy this fast food video please leave a like down below any questions any thoughts leave them in the comments section until our next season 13 upload the Phoenix peace foreign ","35":"oh what's going on game leapers past 13.9 mate here we go bro we're gonna be going through the changes in this patch and what they're gonna mean for League of Legends and the rift what are they gonna mean for your win rate is pretty much nothing it's still going to be 50 so watch the last video I did on showmaker playing Yasuo mid you can apply that stuff to every single role in the game you know to be able to actually play the game at the highest level anyway these changes they are interesting some of these Champions are going to be really busted I think or more busted than they already are but we also have a link to one of the best applications I've ever seen matters opgg app easily the best one I've seen and I actually think it's useful for anyone playing this game in any single ELO because when you get in champ Stakes you can have the app choose the runes for you when you get in game as well the items that you choose that is also based off the most popular items built on those champions in higher levels of play and it's so easy to install and set up all you have to do is log in and connect your league account it's so easy and so quick and you will have this for eternity one of the things I really love as well that's kind of unique is that they have this op Champions page that updates every single hour so you can just go on to this and you can see that in every single ELO there are different op Champions because those elos change of course right so if you're diamond or above you can look at what's op and diamond and above if you're a platinum you can have a look at what wins the most in Planet same with gold silver bronze Etc I just think it's such a useful tool and if you guys don't install this like you are legit missing out because thousands of people are so all you have to do is click on one of those links in the description and comment section and you will know why the jizz absolutely Frost about this like I think this app is just so so good and it is a hundred percent gonna help you win games so if you want to get an edge on your competition this is the application you need to download right now super easy super quick and super freelo let's get into the changes Champion Buffs first of all let's talk about atrox in the Top Lane your passives damage based on the health ratio is increasing at later levels also you're getting a bit of a Reaper with the old bonus movement speed this is going up by 10 15 and then 20 at the respective ranks so rank 1 level 6 Rank 2 level 11 and rank 3 level 16. I don't think these are gonna mean too much Rachel so bonus movement speed going up it's definitely nice and this will affect his winner at a bit more than the passive buff but the issue is that well omnivan really isn't what it used to be especially from Eclipse right because they gave this ability hey so no longer omnifamp and because Grievous wins are so much better these days it's pretty hard for aatrox to find himself in this matter you find yourself you'll find right let's move on to volleyball W's damage on a way to that W damage health ratio is going up to six percent from five percent also the heel health ratio in this is increasing by one percent one and a half percent two percent two and a half percent and then three percent at each respective rank this is actually like pretty nice for volley bear and this is for every role as well if you're playing him in the jungle or in the Top Lane but I don't really think volleyball is still going to be like that amazing the movement speed Murphy cop to his Q not so long ago has really made the pair well not really a bear at all and he's really not that scary maybe they have to do something with like your ultimate because it is like pretty obnoxious playing against if you do get a lead disabling Tower damage so I think they have to some more revert in which I'm pretty sure they're gonna do actually there's like a mid-scope planned in the near future but yeah most of the volleyball Buffs are to his W moving on to the mummy umu your w space damage is now going to be a flat 20. so this is actually increasing if you only have two points in it for the more points you put in it it's actually going down from its original 28 damage but the actual real buff here is the percentage HP damage you're now going to have in your W because it's increasing from one to one point six percent to one to two percent this means like the later the game goes and Champions start getting more HP right you're going to be dealing more damage through your W so it might even be worth to Max this second and get it maxed out by level 13. and let me know you guys what you think of the bus and the nurse we'll talk about in this video in the comments section now moving on to Swain I think these are like some of the low-key best Buffs in this patch so if it's when your cues based damage is increasing by a five at each rank but you're also getting more AP ratio in it now this is also the same for each bolt you actually throw out with your qrite so that is increasing as well both the base damage and the AP ratio this could be huge especially mid to late game which is what you play Swain for but not only that the base damage racing means that in the early game well if you're playing AP carry Swain bot Lane if you're playing him in the mid lane you have to respect him more I actually think this could be a great pick especially in the mid lane to counter those like close range Champions and in the bot Lane as well because the meta is really oriented at the moment a rounding gauge Champions Swain close range Champion you want people to be within that radius of your ultimate and this puff I think is really good for him now last year epic guys getting above them 13.9 is the Rundle and for trundle your base attack speed is going up this is big this is champion who likes attack speed especially if you play him in the Top Lane with like blade of the Rune king or something and your base Mana is increasing as well now baseman are increasing I don't really think it's like two in Pawn for the jungle because you can't have blue buff you'll get the sustain from the jungle item and female like killing Grump and stuff but if you start red buff and just run somewhere on the map the base matter going up means you have a bigger pool to actually spam your spells a little bit more so this is nice and like I said the base attack speed going up is just really good for any former Trundle Top Lane trundle for early dueling and you know clearing minions and stuff and in the jungle for going through camps and skirmishing sacking your Tempo this will be better so watch out for trundling 13.9 I think he could be back now as far as Champion nosco we have two we have science this is the first one it's your passive HP the actual HP you lose in your passive is increasing at every single rank now so when you're in your passive you'll be losing more of this and that will mean guys your passive is going to Decay like one to one and a half seconds faster than it was originally pretty big nerve to the passive and this is really what like players are playing a d cyan for so it's a big hit to attack damagean in particular now the other Champion getting nerfed for this is jinx your ad Grover I think I mentioned this in our previous video or one of them AG growth is going down this means you're scaling into the mid to late game you're not getting as much attack damage oh my goodness me it's over for Jinx and that's not bro like just build Kraken Slayer Infinity Edge you'll be sweet don't worry about it yeah now Champion adjustments we've got two here that are actually detailed on the patch notes and these are belveph and Talia now we've already mentioned Talia in a previous video it's your ultimate cooldown lockout you are only going to be locked out for three seconds from using your ultimate when you take damage if you are dealing damage like clearing a wave or hitting a wood or something or hitting an enemy Champion you can use your ultimate immediately still it doesn't actually matter it doesn't put it on cooldown it's only if you're taking damage so I think this is a really big quality of life but for Talia and she will be picked a heck of a lot more and just be better off for it and the other Champion is belveth and honestly guys like I think Ryan had done this so they stopped like you know players picking bellbirth in the Top Lane maybe support and this is your Q's modified monster damage is increasing to 140 percent but you are losing attack damage growth so as you get levels because you get more levels in the Top Lane right and you probably do get less in the jungle in most games this attack damage growth Nerf is targeted at the Top Lane in the jungle because you're getting more modified monster damage this is gonna actually be like kind of nuts for you and you're still only losing like not that much attack damage anyway at level 18. I think she's gonna be even better honestly if you're playing bill with jungle guys I think she'll be the best jungler in 13.9 if she isn't already so I don't really know like why Riot did this but hey it's right guys this is the balance team and the final change guys for 13.0 we actually know about is the lichbane this is a straight above the AP is going from 75 to 85 so if you're playing Victor if you're playing Echo Twist of Fame there'll be other champions of course this should be music to your ears but I don't really think it's going to change too much to be honest in terms of build pass and all that if you're going Shadow flame you're probably still going to go Shadow flame if you need a zanya's second you're probably going this but a buff is a buff guys those are the changes for 13.9 let us know in the comments section your thoughts on these thank you so much for watching the video if you did enjoy please remember to leave a like down below and I will see you in our next season 13 upload the Spinners peace ","36":"who is the most difficult champion in League of Legends what about the easiest in today's video we're going to be answering those questions ranking every champion from easiest to hardest for season 13. to be as clear as possible these rankings will be focused around how easy or difficult it is to pick up said Champion you may have heard this referred to as the skill floor of a champion think of it like how many games does it take to play the champion at a proficient level the lower the amount of games the easier the champ and vice versa from easiest to hardest will have four different tiers consisting of easy medium hard and expert these kind of lists can be very opinion based so to eliminate as much bias as possible we looked at an interesting stat to help us make decisions on certain Champs the stat being the one-trick win rate minus the average win rate for each Champion a higher number from this formula tends to indicate a more difficult champ while a lower number points towards an easier Champion for example someone like Dr Mundo top his one-trick win rate minus his average win rate is only three percent which goes to show that he's pretty simple to pick up and the more time you spend on him doesn't lead to a crazy increase in power now of course it's impossible to please everyone with a list like this so if you guys disagree with any of the rankings then let us know why down in the comments below so let's start things off by taking a look at our Top Lane easy tier these are champions that should take you less than 20 games to get the hang of them and begin playing at a level where you can be impactful malphite for example has point-and-click abilities for all of his basic spells you can be first timing malphite and easily impact games just by being super tanky and hitting the occasional ultimate in team fights just by diving on the enemy ADC and pressing e you limit their DPS potential by a large margin and it's not difficult at all to pull this off malphite's one-trick win rate minus his average win rate is only three percent So based on his stats he's someone you can see good results with almost immediately our medium tier for Top Lane consists of Champions that require a bit more skill expression but are often still pretty straightforward someone like mordekaiser is by no means a difficult pick but he does have two skill shots and Mort e can be used in very unique ways based on the situation for this reason it's going to take you at least a couple more games to learn mordekaiser's kit compared to that of malphites and bringing some stats into this one as well mordekaiser's one-trick win rate minus his average win rate is five percent so two percent higher than that of our easy tier malphite more skill shots aren't the only factor that make a champion more difficult though or else we wouldn't have Jacks in the medium tier malphite can just brainlessly toss his Q out for poke to win trades while a champion like Jax needs to pick and choose his trade Windows a little more selectively playing off enemy cooldowns is often way more important with these medium tier Champions so although Jags isn't too mechanically demanding he's definitely not in the easy tier because learning matchups and knowing what you can accomplish at certain points in Lane are more via title to your success moving up into our hard tier for Top Lane you're gonna run into a lot of micro and macro demanding Champions Nar is a really good example here as he's a champion who has multiple skill shots has a very unique kit with his rage bar and needs to time his Transformations properly to see maximum success simply learning how to stack rage efficiently before a team fight will take you multiple games to get used to although singed isn't a very mechanically intensive Champion the macro required to play an optimal singed is so much greater than the average top laner which lands him in the hard tier proxy farming is something that's pretty unique to singe that very few other Champions perform as regularly so learning this new play style is going to take you a substantial amount of games and for the expert tier These Are the Champions you'll need to spend the most amount of time on to Simply play them at an average level irelia is a great example of an expert tier Champion as there's so many things you have to focus on with her compared to the major majority of top layers keeping track of passive Stacks being aware of low Health minions for Q resets combined with hitting e consistently or just a few things that make irelia a little more difficult to pick up irelia along with most of the other expert tier Champs are also very feast or famine lacking considerable hard CC so you need to know your matchups way more to see good results learning matchups can take hundreds of games so it's a big factor to why these Champs are in the experts here so even though we had mordekaiser in our medium tier for Top Lane he's in the easy tier for Jungle so why is that the case one of the major factors in a jungler's difficulty rating is how adaptive they need to be with each game Moore can literally just full clear hit Level 6 as quick as possible and begin taking over games from then on out in fact if you want to learn more jungle for season 13 we have a dedicated course for it on our website to help you guys out shyvana is of a very similar theme to Mort you don't need to interact with the Enemy jungler or even gank at all to win games on shyvana control objectives Farm efficiently and you will win games through that consistency for the mediums here we're getting into junglers who require a little more game knowledge to pull off even though Evelyn does like to full clear and is pretty easy mechanically the way you play her due to the stealth mechanic is something very unique to Eve so it's not super easy to learn with a lot of the medium tier junglers you require more of a game plan than the easy tier junglers you can just Farm all you want on Master Yi and shyvana but to get the most out of someone like Zack's kit you need to be ganking and keeping track of your teammates Lane States for the jungle hards here we're getting into many picks that are a lot more volatile and can be punished way harder when making mistakes if you're playing a medium to your tank like sejuani Zach or amumu losing early game isn't the end of the world as you know you'll be impactful come the mid game for this reason learning specific jungle matchups isn't the most vital for many a medium and easy tier junglers for hearts here junglers though like Rengar Shaco Zed and Keanu falling behind isn't an option if you want to be impactful in any way this means you need to learn your jungle matchups understand your Champion's limits at certain stages of the game and have a set plan on how you're going to Snowball the experts here for Jungle is very volatile just like the hearts here but these Champions are even more mechanically demanding nidalee passes the eye test for an expert tier jungler but the statistics are also aligned perfectly to really solidify her spot nidalee's one-trick win rate minus her average win rate is 10 percent that spread is absolutely insane and it just goes to show how night and day the champion is depending on who's piloting her for the mid lane easy tier you're gonna find Champions who require very little mechanical skill and are also very effective with a small sample size Annie is for the most part all point-and-click even though her W and her R technically skill shots they're almost as easy to land point-and-click spells it's also super easy to impact games with Annie even if you're first timing here as multi-man Timber stuns and team fights are not that difficult to hit knowing matchups are also not that important for the majority of these Champs due to the fact that they have ways to contribute even when they're behind jumping over to the medium tier for mid lane we have someone like kassadin who you could argue is even easier to play with than any mechanically but with Cass there's a lot more that goes into the champ Beyond mechanics Cass is much less impactful when behind than someone like Annie so you're a lot more reliant on knowing how to play early game match-ups get in the hang of how to enter fights properly is also more difficult for an assassin-like cast as you have to pick and choose your openings more carefully and the hearts here for mid lane you're gonna find many more mechanical Champions and picks that are generally a lot more vulnerable Cassiopeia is a really good example of this as she's a shorter range Mage who is 100 reliant on Landing her Q skill shot to deal damage so now only do you have to worry about consistently Landing your spells but spacing properly is way more important on Cass which is not easy to learn the experts here for mid lane is scattered With Champions who are extremely volatile and need to be played in a very precise way for you to see results the stats really back up this tier as well with Lee sin Kiana Yasuo and Lucian all having the spread between their average win rate and one-trick win rate above eight percent Kiana has always been one of those Champions who decimates the higher elos but struggles a ton in the lower ranks players that don't spend a ton of games on Kiana just don't see anywhere close to the results of those who have making our way down to the bot Lane the easy carries are ones that are not extremely reliant on spacing and weaving Auto attacks to be effective Ash MF and sivir have elements in their kits that allow them to influence games without having to Auto attack at all same thing with Vigor and seraphim you can lose Lane not have a clue how to play your matchup but still end up more impactful than the enemy carry by Landing one good crowd control ability for the mediums here Tristana is a champion we originally had in the easy tier but bumped her into medium because she's more reliant on weaving Autos to be effective now with that said due to tristana's self-peel and long range Gap closer she's one of the more Noob friendly medium difficulty adcs if you're looking for that slight step up from the easy tier Champs we actually have a detailed guide on how to carry low ELO from ADC that involves a strategy for Tristana so check it out on our website if you're interested varus is a tricky one because although he has ways to be effective without requiring Immaculate spacing and kiting he's still more skill shot Reliant than the easy tier picks with Varys every single one of his damaging spells is a skill shot you can definitely be impactful on various without needing to kite efficiently but it's gonna take a bit more time than the easy tier Champs taking a look at the Hard tier for ADC a common theme you'll notice among most picks is that their very short range Champs not only are most of them shorter range but they don't have ways to be effective other than dealing damage these two factors make it extremely vital that you're mechanically sound as you have to be outputting DPS without getting caught to carry games the expert tier for ADC is just a small step up from the hearts here for Ezreal he's way more reliant on hitting a skill shot to deal maximum DPS compared to the hard tier Champs which puts him a tier above kalista is an extremely unique ADC as no other Champion has her mechanic where you can hop after Auto attack this mechanic alone will take you a ton of time to get used to and when you also factor in kalista as a shorter range extremely early game Reliant ADC she's the furthest from a noob friendly champ having a look at the easy tier for support let's talk about why we have brand here keep in mind that we're ranking Champions based on how easy they are for you to pick up right away and find success now although bran may be more difficult to master due to his abundance of skill shots all you have to do is point and click R in a team fight to be impactful you can literally be ending on brand Miss every W but have your leandries finished press R and A bunched up team fight and deal a mass amount of AOE damage the medium tier for support is not as forgiving as the easy tier you can win games on Heimerdinger by simply putting down towers and creating pressure but with many of the medium tier Champs they're a little more nuanced than that Yumi was actually one of the more difficult Champs to ranks because believe it or not based on statistics she's actually one of the more difficult Champs the difference in win rate of a one-trick Yumi and an average Yumi is 11 which is not something we expected instead of leaning more heavily on stats we sided with the eye test for this one as the skill 4 of Yumi is not all that high considering she can be impactful by just pressing e on her carries Nami was a little more difficult to rank as well because it's easy to get confused with skill floor and skill ceiling for this video we're a rating Channel based on skill floor and in that case it's not that difficult to pick up Nami and see decent results right away if you're playing with Lucian all you gotta do is Place W and E on him and you're golden which is not difficult at all hitting Nami Q on a consistent basis is where the skill expression of the champion lies and it's not easy to do if this were a list based on the skill sealing of Champions Nami would likely be in the hard tier instead of medium the hard tier for support features a lot of Champions who either have very unique play Styles or are super skill shot Reliant if you're someone who Mains ADC then learning Cinna is not going to be all that difficult for a support main though who's never played a traditional ADC Sinnoh plays so much differently than your average support which will take most support players a lot more time to get used to someone like Blitz on the other end of the spectrum where you have one single ability that makes or breaks the champion so learning how to use Blitz q and finding consistent results with him makes his skill floor or quite High just three Champions and our experts here for support being thresh zareth and Bard now you might be wondering well how is xerath an expert tier but brand and Zyra are easy aren't they all skill shot Reliant Mages yes however xareth doesn't have that easy to land AOE nuke that both brand and Zyra possess and his skill shots are much more difficult to land zareth needs to hit his basic skill shots to be effective he can't just blow the enemy team up with one spell which makes his skill floor much higher than someone like bran alright guys before we wrap this up let's tell you a little more about skill cap so we offer a five division rank up guarantee and think that's a pretty crazy thing to offer it's like a gym membership guaranteeing you'll get ripped your local gym would go bust if they offered that right not us we've offered this for years because our service really does work it works so well in fact that we are able to produce by far the largest catalog of Premium League guides on the internet we add over 20 videos a week with over 1600 sides curated into over 100 courses no one can compare we've also sent Challenger players into elohel's 714 times and Counting where they commentate how to carry live they also respond to all questions asked sign up today for as little as 6.99 a month if you are serious about improving so there you have it guys ranking every champion from easiest to hardest for season 13. thank you all so much for watching good luck in solo queue and we'll see you in the next one ","37":"hey what's up game weepers this is eggs in today's video three most broken champions for each one 13.7 and there are gonna be a few changes in 13.7 and therefore there are going to be some new Champions on this countdown and of course at the end of this video you're not going to really learn anything I might give you a tip for each Champion we'll have to see but for the most part you're still gonna like come away from this the same kind of hard stuff play that you are right now this video is not going to impact you at all bro you know it will actually watching my content on the website and our other Challenger players and coaches what we're uploading the videos whether it's like a kind of dissected coaching video from myself about one of my students climbing like divisions and tears in like only a matter of weeks whether it's one of our other content creators uploading maybe something like an ad carry guide a general macro guide whatever it is whatever resource you need whatever kind of like skill you need to develop we have everything on our website at gamelap.com link Down Below in the description and comment section so join thousands of your fellow Summoners and get signed up for exclusive access to our library of content and yeah let's get into the three most broken each role which is not going to actually improve you at all now top playing going to start by talking about Fiora and Fiora has just got like nurse in season 13. nothing is really like gone her way but next patch with Dev stands giving you the ability heads back pretty much just getting reverted this is really good for you ability hates is just more important than not giving you anything like how the previous step stance was so this is a nice change for Fiora also just the matter of the Top Lane in the moment lots of tanks are being picked other bruises have actually been kind of nerfed in a way so Fiora and according to the stats as well is a very strong champion at the moment and will continue to be if not even better in 13.7 because of the D Squared buff now coming into number two another champion is going to benefit a lot from the dev stance revert is Riven because ability Haze is one of the most important stats for you along with attack damage and death dancers giving you both of course you still want to probably go Eclipse as your Mythic item which is really why Riven is actually like strong again and I guess we should also mention the season 13 bus and that was pretty much just because Reuben wasn't op for a patch so well done to the balance team but yeah Riven with the clips from ravenous Hydra and then by going the updated or reverted death stands I think this shampoo is going to be super opinion she is at the moment as well just like fiorishi's class provide is an S Plus state champion in the high reloads and even in lower elos she's still a very strong champion and will be even better next patch now number one if you don't have this guy in your champion pool at the moment then you're probably trolling as a top laner this being Mal fight now I do think it's a little bit risky blind picking this Champion for sure because you allow AP tour planers because you are just like the ultimate attack damage  to actually play the game right and be really effective so if you're playing male fight against something like a Vladimir a Canon or Silas blind picking mouth is definitely risky so try to pick this guy when you actually know what the enemy team is gonna pick in the Top Lane you're an amazing counter to so many attack damage Champions particularly those who actually rely on attack speed because of your e right so because of the Boston malphite in season 13 a couple of patches go to your W by going FrostWire Gauntlet and whether you're taking Comet or grassly undying Comet obviously you want to be mass and Q first and poking them so if you're not actually going to be able to Auto attack the enemy Champion it might be a range Champion please make sure Q first will comment if you are going to be able to trade them definitely consider matching your W first it can be done with grass the undying visual Keystone but malfun number one top laner I think this is pretty much impossible to actually just view now moving into the jungle here coming in at number three a champion who loves close range fighting and a close range matter this is belvip and that's what league is actually becoming now because of all the support changes especially the Buffs to those like Tanki engage supports loves this right she loves close range combat because that means that you're e the 70 damage reduction well you can just get more damage off right against ranged Champions who can kite you that's annoying so if you're playing into like azeri Lulu Janna maybe a Yumi something like this all of these champers are actually just worse off now and we're actually seeing a lot more engage being picked awesome for belveth pretty much statistically as well in every single ELO billfish is still an extremely strong Champion so she's number three now number two if you actually want a bit of AEP in the jungle then it's hard to go past Echo guys this Champion even without the Nash's tooth buff from last patch so you're getting like 15 extra ability haste even those 200 extra gold doesn't actually really matter right because Ekko innately speaking is one of just like the purest strongest op Champions we have at the moment it doesn't really matter what happens in The Meta the champion doesn't really have many weaknesses like level one and level two you're not really a champion I understand that but but even once you're level three you can do stuff because you have all your basic abilities you scale extremely well it's probably just best to pick Echo when you do have some sort of setup on your team and especially if you're mid laner is some sort of like early game champion who can actually protect you in the first few levels so if you're jungling against something like a kindred or Graves a nidalee something like this it can be quite difficult but yeah just make sure maybe towards your second buff and you should be sweet but yeah Echo is number two now number one for the jungle for another patch this is going to be for my father The King j4 The Descendant this dude is just still gonna be broken like if you're not picking him jungle he's super versatile you can engage you can even peel right there are a bunch of like applications I guess for this champion and whether you're going like full lethality or probably something like door drinking even the new desk dance right you can make use of like I mentioned for Riven and Fiora j4 is still going to be in a very strong position so he is the number one jungler then moving to the mid lane here coming in at number three is a champion getting buffed in 13.7 this being Yasuo it's your passive Shield Bing bigger in the late game and also your e is now going up to four Stacks this means that against lots of range users in the mid lane so stuff like syndra orianna write these range Champions who don't really like playing against you twisted fight can be another one right all of them maxing your way you first might actually be the way to go again even at level one you can consider taking this now because of four Stacks you're gonna be dealing so much damage now Yasuo as well kind of like I mentioned for Belvedere in The Meta right now if you think about those supports who are good stuff like rakan blitzcrank Nautilus these engage Champions that's what you want just try to pick Yasuo or maybe even hover over him and champ select to your jungler and top planer just the rest of your team knows hey I wouldn't mind some knock-ups if you guys can pick them now number two an attack damage mid motor he'll be even better than Yasuo in 13.7 is Talon and he's currently the best attack damage mid laner according to the stats yes Aurelia might be strong said might be kind of okay but none of these compare to the power of Talon because of the bus from last patch right especially your passive dealer more damage and your W's man of course going down there's been some terms of the landing phase you can use your W more often and of course when you procure passive like any good Talon player will you won't dealing more damage and therefore getting more kills snowballing more and just winning more games and then challenge around now this Champion has like a 55 win rate it's impossible for me not to put him on this countdown but the number one mid laner guys despite this shampoo copy nursing 13.7 is going to be the best AP mid later this being Addy yes I understand that your e is getting nerfed but do you care about your a if you're mid lane Annie of course not right that is for support Annie for beta Randy players if you're a Chad any player in the mid lane you don't care about the nurse really one bit you're still going to be maxing your Q first you're still holding on to all the strength that you originally had despite the nurse coming in at 13.7 so Annie still gonna be insane close range better that's what you love probably the strongest champion in the game still now moving down to the bot Lane here the 80 carries coming in at number three just because there aren't many like strong laners anymore Caitlyn is a lot worse off right Draven has kind of fallen off a little bit according to the stats anyway so if you're playing something like twitch who is a scaling champion this is just a really good meta for you and the playgrounds win right in every single yellow kind of backs this up there's a bit more space for you as well yes it might be a little bit scary right playing against those engaged teams but because of your ultimate you have insane range anyway and as long as you actually keep your distance you should be chilly and that's just the case again according to the win rate they are saying that twitch is a top tier s-buster 80 carry across the board now coming in at number two a champion who is probably stronger than the twitch is going to continue to bizarre even though sorry recently as far as our ego Nerf and of course lethal Tempo got enough but that's the same for like every 80 carry well she's still going to be incredibly strong right because she's even better suited to a close range murder than twitches and a lot of the upper 80 carries because of her blade cooling ability and of course her ultimate this Champion with girl Force no Royal quick blades it is still too strong she's pretty much still picked in Ben and I could easily have put her as the nub180 carry but I think the number 180 carry here is actually just like undisputable this being Jinx I don't think there's a stronger ad carry yes you might have some difficult Lane matchups right if you're playing against something like nephilios maybe or if you're playing against a Draven for sure the first 10 minutes is going to be interesting but because of the range you have with your fish perks and because the actual buff staging so your actual like attack speed ride a couple of batches ago they just make her better at getting out of Lane so you can actually get to the middle late game you can get your crack inside spike your Infinity Edge spike a lot more often and because this is accelerated for Jinx because of those crit changes at the sign of the season it's just huge I think Jinx is by far the best ad carry and like I've said for most of these Champions the stats also back that claim up so she's number one now moving down to the supports guys and if you are enjoying these videos where we talk about the best champers and all that let us know by leaving a like down below any questions you have as well any thoughts if you want to play me go ahead leave them in the comment section and for the supports coming into number three we have set up now Santa guys is best picked don't blind pick up because you will run into stuff like Nautilus and get hard stuff so make sure you're counter picking as Santa into stuff you know like enchantresses so even something like Emilio is really good for Senna something like a Lulu something like a Jan and army all of these range Champions if you just see some sort of range Champion unless it's something maybe like zarath might be a little bit annoying picking Senna is just awesome because you outscale all of them and you just get free Stacks the lane is going to be a lot more chill than if it is against a blitzcrank Ricard you know Nautilus Champions like these it's going to be a little more difficult and there's a much higher chance if you're actually just running it down but Center number three because of the changes in season 13 to Center they've been awesome for her you still probably want to go to a Thalia so as far as like umbral clay but clips that can really make use of the actual damage Buffs to your ultimate but yeah Center number three now moving to number two a champion who would love to play against Cena and all those are Mobile support is blitzcrank one of the biggest Cooks in the game in the bowling at split screen you land one pool they're gonna get blown up awesome Champion every single ELO who's probably the most I would be support but for me actually there is one support who's better and this is because you can blind pick rakan a lot easier than you can blitzcrat yes you can still blind pick blitzcrank but what about if you run into a Leona and Alistair a Braum ataric those Champions really do counter you well I would actually love to get pulled it's pretty much impossible for you to ever like find an angle onto the enemy that you carry when the Braum Alistar or whoever is just standing in front of them asking you to hook them so yeah that is why rickon is number one the Buffs in season 13 to this champion and also the fact that Zyra is still really strong this combination is probably still the hash one bot Lane out of all the combinations so rakan is the number one support so those were the three most broken Champions guys for each 13.7 thank you so much for watching the video up until this point like actual shout out to all you guys and I will see you in our next season 13 upload the spinnix peace foreign ","38":"hey what's going on game weepers this is eggs in today's upload 13.7 changes in this video we are going to talk about the win rate so the Champions who got changed in this patch how much have they improved how much have they gotten worse we're going to get into all the details in the next 10 or so minutes so make sure you stick around for the whole thing and guys if you do want to improve for this game bro like this video is not going to help you mate you're still going to be clamped you're still going to be hard stuck at the end of it and by the way like if you're one of those people who think the Champions matter like dude Faker can pick I don't know Teemo mid lane and still pop off in like a diamond platinum game you know why that's because he knows how to play this game as well as anyone that's really what the ELO system is about who you play is largely irrelevant so you can listen to this video and tell your friends about how broken this Champion is and how amazing the bus have been for this Champion but in the big picture it doesn't mean anything what actually means something is telling your friends about the gameweave website because I challenge your players and coaches upload so many videos for your benefit and that's right for your benefit you will actually improve like hardcore improve not like pseudo improve and win one more game in the next 100 because you're playing an OB Jam been we're talking about improving fundamentally of the game which is what every challenge a player has under their belt so to know exactly what it's like to feel the power like a challenger Player sign up to the website linked down below and yeah let's get into the video so we will start by talking about the Champions who got buffed in 13.7 starting yourself we have kalista whose win rate in Platinum and above and all these stats guys are from platinum and above and kalisto's win rate has actually dropped by over one percent now I'm guessing the reason for this is that like lots of callista players well there's just more of them now who aren't used to callista right because they kind of like you guys watching this video kalista got buffed oh my God let me pick her and you don't actually know how to play the champion which is just like a big issue it doesn't matter how broken she is if you can't play her if you can't Kaiden she is very difficult to play You're Going to lower the win rate so yeah I just think there are a bunch of like new Calista players playing this champion and that's why I win right shot but there's no doubt in my mind she is stronger anchor list domains let me know down below if you can actually feel that your attack damage growth and buff in particular now next up we have Yasuo and funnily enough yasuo's win rate has also decreased it even though you are getting a bigger passive Shield the e-buff is kind of like maybe a bait in a way yes you might be getting up to four Stacks from your e but the issue is is like how often are you actually going to be getting to four Stacks during the laning phase of course you can like E34 minions and get onto the enemy Champion but it actually takes longer to stack up now and it's a lot easier to react to for the enemy Champion's ride so in a way this was actually just a Nerf and that is actually reflected in the win rate drop hit but the way to still play this Champion is to still Max your Q first and because you're maxing your e last and you actually get the damage at rank 5. now you're gonna wait until Level 13 until you get the max juice out of it so a pretty interesting patch with one of the win Brothers now moving into the jungle here we have Graves whose win rate I don't know why it is guys but like most of these Champions who got buffed their Windows drop and Graves exactly the same thing but the reason here is actually really clear and that's because his pick rate has gone through the roof it's actually doubled than what it was before so again it's kind of like the kalista thing right kalista is almost double so with gray is being played over twice as much this means that lots of new players who are new to graves are playing him and affecting his win rate no doubt he got buffed they might not be the biggest boss in the world but his win rate certainly should not decrease again the only explanation for this is because lots of people who don't know how to play the champion are just playing him because they're like you guys watching this video they think this is going to be the cheap easy shortcut to getting better it's not they are still trash now Katarina mid laner Hope Winery has actually gone down almost one percent why I've got no idea I don't know if it's because people are going like hybrid build or trying some you know random Builder because of like the attack speed thing they gave you with your ultimate I'm not sure what the go is here but maybe again it's because her pick rate is improved by three percent so it's over 12 percent now her band rate has also gone up quite a lot and her win rate is still around like 50 but platinum and above it's really like not that bad even if it has decreased maybe because yeah well to new katarinas are playing her and I'm guessing like lots of new Katarina players are just locking her in and running it down the mid lane with her now Alistair if we go down to the bomb Lane Alistair actually got legit buff and there's no doubt that this like I don't think it changes anything dude honestly like even though his window has gone down point three percent guys just playing like he's a lot tanker in the early game he works really well with a lot of Champions who are pretty good in the bot Lane at the moment whether it's something like Kalisto who got whether it's something like Samira to counter Champions maybe like Draven and affilios he has a lot of actual uses and you don't even have to engage sometimes you can also act as a peeling Alistair so Alistar in 13.7 he's definitely better these stats are just pretty pseudo at the moment but one Champion the only Champion guys who actually got like changed or buffed in 13.7 whose win rate has improved almost two percent thank goodness for this is is it so for the emperor sharima the best way to play this guy now is actually to match your W first and the funny thing at the moment right now in 13.7 in Challenger ELO azir has over a 55 win rate now honestly we just know what's gonna happen right like if the pigeon stays like this bro he's going to be picked and bad at MSI and we're just going to be in the same like Pro play meta we've been in for God knows how long like since what season five or six whenever he like really became popular so yeah it's kind of unfortunate maybe but he is actually buffed so a w Max into a qmax with the new damage you get from your W and the less damage and range I guess you get from your conquering Sans is obviously more work to match your rides and your win rate as a result has arisen that was pretty bad but I don't care is this better and azir means if you're listening I'd love to know how he actually feels in the comment section are you happy are you unhappy with the bus let us know down below now moving into the Champions who actually got nerfed in 13.7 and all of these win rates have actually dropped thank goodness now the champion who has actually dropped the most in terms of win rate is ramus because you're getting less armor in the mid to late game if your winner has dropped over three percent that is huge but the funny thing is it's just below 50 so it's still kind of respectable that's in Platinum and above now Olaf in the Top Lane his Winery does also drop close to three percent and that's because you're getting less attack speed from your passive and your Q which your Maxim first is actually dealing less damage now there might be some interesting take out there where you might Max like your W or E first maybe we'll have to wait and see if that actually becomes legit but yes if you're still playing Olaf the same way in 13.7 as you were from 13.6 the Viking is a lot worse off in the Top Lane I wouldn't even be surprised if Ryan gave him like kind of a little bit of a conversation but for this win rate is still close to like 51 and moving to the Jungle Wukong one of those popular junglers in Pro play at the moment who got nerfed well thank goodness he's getting nerfed it's about time because he's picked him and all the time right Divine sunderer conqueror stacking Wukong it's too strong and because your early game really got hit here as far as your attack damage goes and the actual attack speed from your e that you're getting the W cooldown Nerf doesn't really like do anything but hey it might mean something in mid to late game team fights and yeah his win rate is dropped 2.7 it's still about 50 so of course you can still pick The Monkey King but he's nowhere near as strong that's the same for sejuani as well guys her winner has dropped just over two and a half percent so a win rate overall is actually now below 49 you only really want to be picking sejuani therefore if you've got a lot of melee Champions on your team or if you think you can just like cuck the enemy Champions so like your Q is really good at knocking up Champions who are in the air or go Airborne something like a Zack for instance sejuani can do very well into but yeah sejuani worse off in 13.7 another champion Warsaw is Lee's sin his winner has dropped 2.38 and kind of like work on your base attack damage going down your base armor going down this means at least since early game which is really where he you know kind of like flourishes is not those are good so Lee sin be careful about locking in The Blind Monk thinking he's as strong as he was before because he clearly isn't Now zarya is really the only pure ad carry who got nerfed in this patch guys and what's happened is that your win rate has dropped over two percent they'll actually think this was good I know the zero Mains are probably going to be unhappy right but you're still playing zerry it's not like her identity got crushed where you're losing movement speed or attack speed or anything like that yes you're losing a little bit of Health growth and a couple of other things but it's not the end of the world this Champion as well especially in high reloads was very oppressive this brings her in line a bit and I think in lower elos as well you can actually pick her without her being banned and you know picked by the enemy team in every single game now moving to the Jungle Cassie's got some interesting changes not really Nerfs but they actually have proven to be nursed kind of to my surprise as well because for the enemy Champions to be isolated well they can actually be closer to their teammates so you can actually proc your isolation damage a lot more but the issue for kha'zix is that well you lost a lot of your slope yes the slope was like 90 when you got your live void spikes evolved but the issue here is that your W is kind of like just a useless ability until you evolve it now because they really just like gig on Earth the slope on the pre-evolution and yes your ultimate might be lasting a little bit longer and it does make it interesting if you're going something like accident a mark but it doesn't really do that much like kha'6 in the current meta against a lot of conqueror champions in the jungle it's pretty hard to actually like make him work ever since the durability meta bug Splat hasn't really been like popping off so kind of unfortunate but maybe if there is some sort of like follow-up of the kha'zix he actually becomes really good again now thresh One support who got changed in 13.7 and that's just the fact that your Q so the actual light kind of when you get it back up well you're not gonna have it back up after you land one death sentence now so you can't chain CC someone with that lasso this is just a good change from right and his win rate is still about 51 in Platinum above really not that bad so it has dropped like close to one and a half percent but honestly guys not a big deal still pick thresh in the same games you're gonna pick him in now Annie in the mid lane guys and also is to support it which is where she really got enough has decreased in terms of win rate so your win rate is still over 53.4 in the mid lane so big deal but it has dropped over 1.2 percent because of the E Nerf and as the support is dropped even more to over 52 but yeah it has actually dropped over 2.6 if you're playing any support in Platinum and above because yeah as any support audio Max in your e first and because that's what they really nerfed from Rank 2 onwards so if you put more points in it it's actually less worth now so Annie's win rate in both roles have dropped which makes sense for mid lane as well it was of course going to impact her but nowhere near as support any but the final two Champions here guys both begin with the letter V first of all we have Vega now if you're playing Vega in the mid lane or in the bot Lane both iterations of purple Gandalf are going to be worse so his win rate in the mid lane is just below 51 for platinum and above this has dropped over one percent in the last couple of days but AED carry or AP carry ball Lane Gandalf this has actually decreased over two percent so wherever you're playing Vega at the moment you are just in a worse position it's harder to get out of the early game without being behind whether it's even in terms of farm now because you're losing a p ride in your q and even your W it's harder to actually get those stacks and get to the mid to late game without being super far behind because of this you are a lot more team Reliant so if your team is running it down in the first 10 to 15 minutes it's a wrap it's GG now the last champion to talk about guys and if you are enjoying our season 13 content make sure you leave a like down below any questions about the video as well leave a comment don't really think there are going to be questions for these videos but anyway we have VI whose winwriters actually dropped the least and it's only gone down by point eight percent she still picked on over seven percent of games and to still have over a 51 close to 51.5 win rate not really a big deal here we don't have to go around you know complaining about how these nurse killed via so yeah I think VI you can still pick her kind of like thresh right just still pick these champions in the same games you were going to pick them in no real worries there so those were the champions guys who got changed the most in 13.7 as far as like the boss the nurse and yeah what actually happened to their win rates in the last couple of days tomorrow we'll probably do some sort of like updated till this video so make sure you hit the Subscribe button so you don't miss that more fast food I know you guys love it and yeah we'll see you in tomorrow's video this is Phoenix peace thank you ","39":"oh yeah the game leapers what's going on guys this is the expatch 13.8 the list of changes got released today on Twitter so what are they like who are the champions actually getting changed and stuff well we're going to get into them in this video so make sure you stick around for the whole thing I might even give my opinion on whether these Champions should be buffed or should be nerfed and maybe what these bus on those might be but if you actually want to improve guys this video light means nothing like seriously like you might as well go and watch a cooking video or something bro this is not gonna do anything mate like you're still going to be the same player in the next 10 minutes right if you do actually want to improve sign up to the game website link Down Below in the description and comment section sick of saying to every video if I challenge your players and coaches are actually uploading like actual fundamentals of the game where I like back timing positioning spacing wave management counting cooldowns jungle tracking all of these things right that's what we're talking about on our website I rarely talk about them in these YouTube videos I talk about builds and champions who are op that's about it they're not going to help you at all like you can go ahead and you can play something like a malphite top right and then it's like week until 13.8 comes out and you might win a few more games but what are you gonna do after that when you get to know you're gonna play another champion who's op and you just keep repeating this process you're still going to be in Platinum you're still going to be in Gold bro but yeah let's get into the video anyway right the Champion's getting buffed in 13.8 there are a few of them so we'll start by talking about the junglers now there are three junglers here potentially four getting buffed so first of all we have kha'zix now I actually called this in one of the recent videos I said something like you know Khan sex might get some compensation first because the nurse to his W because it pretty much is like the most pointless ability in the game now even if you do evolve it like I actually said he would get some compensation but because his win rate has actually gone down quite a bit and too much and he's still struggling a lot so well done me I guess but hopefully it's something to do with your W maybe like if he landed it reduces the Champion's armor or something like this maybe that's what happens if you evolve it but yeah they should definitely do something to his W it's just like the most pointless ability in the game and yet the other three junglers or potentially three junglers getting changed but one of these is definitely going to be nidalee she's getting buffed now niddly I think right have to be a little bit careful here they are permanently quite a lot like in recent times actually and they haven't really done much to her but I don't really know why she's getting birth like I still think she's strong especially if you can play her well so if you guys check the stats in high reloads she still does very well right she pretty much has no counters in the jungle she's a very oppressive early game Champion she scales pretty well so I don't really like understand why they're buffing her maybe it's just like a pure low ELO buff but they have to be pretty careful if it doesn't affect High ELO but yeah nidalee is a champion on her getting buffed also an AP jungler getting buffed in 13.8 is Lilia that Lilia at the moment that actually makes more sense to me because she is worse off right whether it's like the Demonic Embrace nurse Lily are being changed to what was it like a melee Champion so she doesn't get something from demonic I don't know it's something like that I can't remember exactly but you guys know what I'm talking about especially those of you who play Lilia and at the moment yeah I think she's outperformed by a lot of AP junglers Echo Evelyn Fiddlesticks nidalee even so Lydia really isn't performing as well as she'd like to be and her getting buffed in 13.8 I can definitely understand it again we'll have to wait until tomorrow to see exactly what these changes are gonna be now the other jungle guys well you can play as a top laner as well and even as a support in certain team compositions this is Poppy so poppy getting buffed yeah kind of agree but I guess because she's normally like the most popular Champion I think they could do like a lot with her kid as well that might make her a lot more interesting and you're only really picking this Champion to counter certain things probably things with dashes right so if it's like a Jack's top or something like this you can just lock her in if it's like Zack jungle you pick poppy you press W and the game is GG right so there are certain Champions and you know like interactions I guess with your own kit what you'd really like to pick poppy but generally speaking she's not really like innately strong so probably getting buffed on all four as well now if we move him to the Top Lane here there's only really like one Champion getting buffed this being Garrett now Garen I understand maybe in like a lower elos might be performing at a higher click than he is in higher reloads so I do think they have to be a little bit careful in terms of buffing this guy but Gavin I think like maybe the problem is that his kid is just like so I don't even know what you're calling maybe linear because if you're playing Garen you're just like running in a straight line spinning around and then running back out in a straight line there's not really much like dynamism to his play right so if they can bring this into his kit it might be interesting but because it's just listed here as Champion Buffs it's not like they're updating anything here you know they'll probably do something to of his abilities of course or Bass stats I don't know but yeah Garen is getting buffed in the tall plane now if we move into the mid lane there is only one Champion here guys getting buffed this being Zoe and I don't know why because she's really strong right now yes in terms of like the meta she might not be picked in Pro play that much because the meta isn't really about like just kind of putting someone to sleep and blowing them up but in solo queue she's so oppressive because solo queue still revolves around Lane but even Pro players like lots of people just don't actually understand that but anyway like Zoe and Lane it's very difficult to beat like she beats every control Mage because of her range and her priority like if you're playing a mage you have to run like d-mat again Zoe because you just get shoved in 24 7. it's really annoying and also against like assassins because you have your e it's very difficult for people to actually like jump onto you and even by level six because your ultimate isn't really like an ultimate compared to like a zed death Mark you should have a big enough lead to not worry about them too much so Zoe getting buffed I'm really scared about this for all you mid laners out there so hopefully this won't be too big of a buff or Buffs now moving to the bot Lane here we have two ad carriers getting back the first of these is Ezreal and Ezreal getting buffed I can kind of see why like he really doesn't have the best win rates but that's kind of Ezreal for you and I guess at the moment in The Meta like there are other ready carriers who are just better Ezreal as well gives a lot of free Lanes to people because he's not really like the most oppressive early game Champion so if you're playing something like cars or affilios you can scale for free so these Buffs I think it makes sense the other attack damage carry getting buffed is kogmore and for kogi well you haven't really received much love especially because Lulu and Yumi are worse off right those attack speed givers kogmore therefore kind of drops off as well you really want Champions next to you who can peel you and because it's like an engage meta in the bottom Lane with Nautilus Leona all these Champions running around thresh as well right so you're really not having the most fun in the bot Lane at the moment so hopefully the boss will actually help you out during the laning phase so you can actually get to the mid to late game just like these other strong 80 carats now Champion Nerfs who's getting nerfed in 13.8 well there are four Champions here and I've already mentioned one of them this being malified in the Top Lane ever since Ryder she buffed his W where you can get like a frostfire gauntlet when you're taking grass into melee Champions you can actually makes your W and just bash them to bits or you can still take comment with your Q if you're against a champion you're not going to Auto attack that much the point is malphite is just innately broken and if you actually look at the stats websites this guy is like ranked one this guy's classified as the most OP champion out of every single champion in the game every single role so malfo getting nerfed I don't think anyone can be mad about this now moving into the jungle we have the champion who's classified as the second most broken in the game right now this being j4 and for j4 to get nerfed exactly like malphite guards I don't think any of us can really complain about this ever since Riot buffed his W this Champion has really just been back in the game and dominating the matter he's got like over a 52 win rate in every single Lilo with conqueror the death dance buff as well from this patch which you can make use of riding 13.7 I just think this Champion is just way too versatile way too easy as well to actually make work so j4 getting nerfed is pretty much just like malified in the jungle right now now moving into the mid lane here I kind of feel sorry for anyone who played aurelian Soul before Riot changed him because at the moment he's just so gimmicky he's easier to play because you just like kind of Glide around the map and you just kill people with the ray of yours right and after a while it just gets really oppressive and even obnoxious to play against like it doesn't even matter if she dumpster this Champion during the laning phase it does scale very well but that's kind of like the Nuance of it if you're playing against Ireland soul and higher reloads should be very easy to actually kind of just like abuse him in the early game so he doesn't even get to the middle again but that's providing that mid lane player knows how to play the mid lane properly and how to make use of their advantages people in lower ELO just don't understand how to do that and again you can actually learn how to do just that via our website link down below but yeah because they don't know how to do this aurelian Soul scales for pretty much free so that's why he's a lot better in lower elos than he is in higher reloads and it does become very op I don't think he should actually be nerfed again just like I mentioned because the higher up you go it becomes very different so I think they should have waited for a patch for this but anyway rolling Soul guys is the third Champion getting nerfed the fourth Champion getting nerfed is just like the malphite of the supports I guess this being Recon and I've mentioned in our recent videos how this Champion like if you're playing the support role you have to have rakan in your champion pool he's so versatile who worse than the most broken ad carry this being Zaya or one of the most broken ad carries you can engage you can peel the buff swim this season which Australia's battle song or radiant virtue the champion is just too good man so Ricard getting Nerf in 13.8 I think this makes perfect sense as well so not bad from the battles team honestly and the only other change here guys listed for 13.8 again in tomorrow's video we will get into all the changes and what they actually are so make sure you hit that subscribe button yeah so the only other change is to Cosmic drive so there's been a lot of talk about Cosmic Drive Right trying to make like a battle mage item for Champions who are actually fighting for an extended period of time again we'll have to see exactly what the changes are because they could change by tomorrow but if we're playing something like Vladimir Silas maybe even something like rise right with the movement speed again we'll have to see exactly what the changes are but those of you who are playing those Majors who would appreciate the item make sure you stay tuned so those were the list of changes guys for 13.8 thank you so much for watching the video this has been eggs and until NX upload peace ","40":"hello and welcome to another best junglers episode this one for patch 13.8 and we've actually had quite a nice meta shake up over the past couple of weeks and months as right have changed the jungle and I'll Tink it with a lot of different Champions they try to Nerf Jarvan let's see if they actually succeeded and clearly right hired someone on the balance team that loves kha'zix a little bit too much so as always we will go over the absolute best jungles for every single MMR overall as well as for high and low but as per usual most people struggle to make the right itemization choices compromising one rates are actually very strong Champions and so to Streamlight the builds process and remove the guesswork head to mobletics completely revamped builds 2.0 feature not only is it significantly faster and more accurate it also calculates the data way quicker as we go from patch to patch and with more unique options presented it gives you four real build options for your Champions this includes off meta varieties for those who want to really figure out a playstyle that suits them and along with these better build calculations means that the items are not just thrown together by win rate data like other sites there are actually full builds that people play and actually end in in games on along with new builds from other regions so you can actually discover what the Korean one tricks are building should you build void stuff should you build death cap Frozen Hut randuins the better situational advice for most items will allow you to make better decisions also available in the app of course and will also import into your game should you want to have things streamlined for you click the link in the description below to itemize like a savant with mobolytics so they've decided to know if the kha'zix W back in 13.7 the thing is they also extended the ability for him to hit isolation on a Target and buffed his ultimate by an extra two seconds activation time and then this patch they decided hey what's a 17 increase in base damage to the Q you know the thing you used to farm and fight and basically use it off cooldown yeah that's a very strong buff to any champion in the game because it affects you from Level 1 and at each level where you level up the ability if they were to adjust bonus ad ratios total ad ratios that would mean you're scaling as the game goes on but this is a strong early game buff making your clear faster your Skirmish ability better and when you shift that in conjunction with the other Buffs and we received the last patch albeit enough to the slow and the W well assassin kha'zix is once more becoming the king of the jungle except in this case it's kind of ridiculous I did cover an hour of off kha'zix on my gameplay Channel and a lot of people are going through that Q evolve and of course people are saying no but Bruce is still better Bruiser was never better my friends unless you were a gurin or someone as such it was not better statistically it was not better an effective reality because if you were just a good positioner good itemization Builder and obviously very good at the kha'zix mechanics you had no issue actually finding some sort of success in the last round of Buffs now however this is above to all forms of kha'zix because base damage just has no bias now let's shift on over to Javan and we will Marvel at the fact I didn't make a kha'zix Evolution joke until this very moment now it's funny is that they Nerf the base damage on Jarvis Q by 10 whereas they buffed kha'zix's by 10 they also however affected the attack damage growth of Javan and reduced that by a little bit as well the thing is he has locked down CC and a giga shield now so what this means is Javon while he was was very very strong he's now nerfed a little bit he is still strong right you don't go from op or Giga strong to being piss useless volleyball level at least within the realm of normal Buffs and nerves so now while his base level clay will be affected in the opposite way the kha'zix was positively affected and his growth on the ad is also likewise not going to be as good the King still is able to lock people down the king is still able to kill squishies the King was over killing people anyway and his CC and guaranteed damage profile with that shield now means that while you might still feel these Nerfs in the first clear early skirmishes and a little bit in the scaling you're basically still going to be like wow I killed that person a little bit slower I needed an extra Q or Auto anyway and I feel like that's a really good segue to udio because we had a Spam gay Kimera with a lot of Jack show demonics abuse they nerfed all of those things and the people were like well I guess we just don't play Udyr anymore yeah but they put experience and gold back into the jungle camps Udyr likes that his playwright keeps going down but his win rate stays huge the champion is still amazing in the jungle the champion still chases people down the champion still has the shield the champion still has a burn damage to Magic damage and percentage damage the physical damage the shield the disruption the get in your face that burn you down to slow you he still has everything that he had before just because they know if the movement speed a little bit on Phoenix and they know if the demonics Embrace clear speed doesn't change anything the guy's still clear as fast as hell runs fast as hell kills people first as hell and is still becoming a little bit unkillable as the game goes on the one thing he isn't is harder than hell but at the same time who really cares when he's this damn effective at winning games from the jungle play your deer again my friends and I can't believe I'm saying this because I hate facing it next we have Evelyn and she is definitely still the Empress of the Jungle and I don't care what you belveth Maine say this is the queen of purple and pink obviously I'm biased in this regard but at the same time the champion just skirmishes Jules assassinate scales and has camouflage I mean what do you do against that unless you're playing something like rek'sai which isn't really that great anymore and Warwick which again is really just a top laner fortunately Rengar players are okay with this but trust me ADC Mains are not immobile Mages or not and he's squishy Champions or not and the fact of the matter is a lot of junglers are not because you have to abuse her early if you do not she becomes a question mark she gets back into the game very very quickly swooping side to side and picking off people one at a time and then killing you in your jungle in your face when you had the lead obviously that's on you to fix but at the same time she has a very straightforward build path and nice alternate conqueror Rune set for the mobifi games which is really effective I show this on my channel you can't miss it it's the one with her on the thumbnail but really what we've got here is assassins Fighters and someone who can really be an effective tank in the Udyr as well as a fighter this is a very diverse top four and when I talk about this in my jungle courses all linked below GG of course we really focus on jungling with each and every style in the most optimal way what are the jungle principles that work for all of these champions in any matter and that's the kind of stuff I'd like to talk about from silver to gold to platinum to Diamond because if you can understand this in the meta these top four how they work you can understand how to play nidalee but can you have the Mechanics for nidalee that's the big question she also received Buffs and everyone in masterplus took a deep side eye of pain it said why just leave her alone she's absolutely fine and now they want to make it more accessible to the people which I don't think is a good thing the champion is absolutely and utterly oppressive when suited to The Meta and when she has high enough stats however I'm still only recommending her for Diamond plus if you play nidalee and you cannot currently get to at least die with a master plus you are either not going to Jungle or you're not good at nidalee you have to pick one I'm sorry that's the reality if you think you're in Italy surviving your jungle sucks well hey I can help you with that but at the end of the day just people don't have the mechanical prowess to make this Champion work effectively she is looking very very strong in hailo only behind kha'zix and win rate at the moment will have to monitor that situation but as a general population I don't normally put nidalee in this page unless she is truly strong and it seems that she might be obviously data will evolve and The Meta will evolve but for now be aware of the cat next up with hecarim who at this particular stage seems to be kind of fine and balanced and it's weird because he's really strong but most people still don't build right and then that gives enemy at jungles the opportunity to shut his him down to play against him appropriately if you're playing assassin and Squishy you have to play Assassin and Squishy you can't just run in 1v5 if you're playing Super tanky you're not gonna be able to assassinate everybody once a pentakill when they group up and have a Kumbaya party but the rotational power the farm Speed The Objective take the scaling the snowball although his new icon looks absolutely ridiculous he looks like a caricature of himself and he was already a cricketer of himself in the first place the horse is strong and the horse is capable much like ragas not only at drinking and throwing drinks at other patrons but also at knocking people up knocking them away stunning them slowing them and juicing them with his overtly powerful kit win rate around 50 still a very difficult Champion you need those animation cancels to be Snappy fluid and understand every single one and when to use them but at the same time remember you are not FK farming you also likewise not AFK ganking a nice Fusion of both principles as we talk about in all my materials from causes to YouTube channels I've always spoken about having a nice balanced approach to jungling and if you can do that and master his combos you will have great success and echo on the other hand I'm putting up here because I think listen this Champion is something that snowballs so damn well if you can have the right measured aggression approach to the champion early game and sort of at least help Elaine here help Elaine there get an Envy there do some counter jungling you know you're just taking pieces a little bit you're compounding your finances and then you're gonna realize you have more experience than gold than everyone else in the map and that's when it's fun time you can do your Arcane cosplay with that nice Bridge scene and take over the game next one to the ATM page and we have Fiddlesticks obviously he was a little bit scared this week when right floated with nerfing the jungle leash ranges again fortunately it was just a bug we can all breathe a sigh of relief but in terms of farming sequencing alting and doing what he does there is no one that sucks better than Fiddlesticks and no one will ever suck better than Fiddlesticks at being an eternal one-trick meta presence that allows junglers to master the art of sequencing and team fighting and just winning if you play fiddlesticks you're most likely a winner likewise via players are also still winners despite the nerves still has guaranteed lockdown scale and people who just don't play around it appropriately they also don't respect it if you can interrupt her Q do it they also don't understand that that queue's like in a three second timer later in the game so her Mobility is insane try and disrupt her early try and get ahead of her early and you have no issue dealing with her but if you let go of the controls and she is able to move side to side and ALT your crucial carries Then You're Gonna Lose Control she's gonna dominate team fights and you'll be wondering what the hell happened next up with ranker I love this pick I think he's in such a great state I covered this on my gameplay Channel as well talking about the fleet footwork Rengar tag this wasn't some sort of Niche thing this was like two three four percent better than other Rune sets on average really dominating in terms of hey look there's a movement speed the sustained elongated Bush jumps way better positioning to get back in and out of bushes and obviously when you combine that with the gas Walker hatchling when you combine that with the full Precision tree as well as whatever secondary tree you would like to have most likely domination you're looking at a champion that doesn't need electric here to First Strike damage procs to kill people he already over kills people so why don't we boost him up just a little bit and give him a few other stats to take him over the edge Rango one tricks are definitely enjoying themselves at the moment likewise Nocturne players are enjoy bringing the darkness to the map obviously they're upset they didn't get the rework he should have got the rework because they have no idea what to do with skarner I think although he is a pretty hidden RP Champion Nocturne isn't hidden up here at all well he is for the ADC but he's not for us we know he's strong in The Meta we know he can Jewel we know he can scale we know he can Farm play around your ultimate know which Champions you can lethal Tempo invade and Destroy time your spell she had appropriately build correctly and remember when it comes to late game team fights if you cannot dive into the five-man death ball Split Force rotation cut in and make the numbers Advantage your advantage next up we have both Earth and I could have put Kindred here but I feel like kindred's always going to be there here and there for one tricks and beloved has good data at the moment people don't play her aggressively enough to try and mess around with builds too much but if you keep things crack and if you keep things blade of the ruin King obviously you can go the Black Cleaver attack if you wanted to her level 1 through 3 her early invades are early pressure her Take Over Control absolutely Bonkers and make sure you're getting them Herald for the fishies and your macro will fall into place as well an Exquisite Champion that is obviously misused you've got to hit your W and you've got anticipate spells from the enemy so you can use your cues appropriately people kind of waste those spells and then you're just a Sitting Duck next we have Kane who was nerfed for the shadow assassin Giga step but that's not really going to change anything until you get to like those quick rotational spells and even then I've seen funny tweets about using Transcendence and as many others have tweeted oh no I can only cross a map in five seconds now instead of 4 seconds anyway he's still gonna kill people he's still gonna over damage people and Ross is like you nerfed shadow assassin why aren't you playing rast in the first place Lilia had a little bit of a shift here giving her some more damage to monsters shifting or healing and giving it way better scaling and basically what we're looking at is a champion who is now fine by fine I mean she's pretty damn good one red boosted up 1.5 percent looking to be a solid pick for low and mid mmrs decent and high although I don't necessarily think you would play her over a lot of the other Champions on this list but if you like AFK farming and you can actually movement speed space and Skirmish appropriately with her she is going to be in a great great spot much like Mercy who exists eternally and as soon as you take away all the CC demonics embracing Jack show Champions is one rate just goes straight back up matters with less CC and less inherent tankiness appeal mean mercies win rate always will increase Champion is fine looking to be okay to play not something that's super Giga op but if your master you player cenarius rank 1e West you know that this thing definitely has the power but if we go to the low ELO page I'm slapping Nocturne on the top because I honestly think if you could rinse repeat player and ultimate you're not going to have the death will comp issues at 20-25 ensure you are learning how to close yes make sure you are playing their pressure again my silver course and iron bronze course really I focus on all this kind of stuff I want as many people to get gold as possible and that's why I designed those things that way to kind of help you say look these team fights are 40 minutes this is not your game my friends I know we always talk about it but why don't we just fix the systemic issue however if you want to go Master Yi and have that issue then you know do it and despite the nerves ramus is ready to counter all of those attack speed heathens and obviously I'm gonna put down the Mordecai's and the Lilia is nice picks in this MMR range likewise Warwick if you're a newer player or someone who just wants to have a bit more rotational power oh yeah and why now for High ELO obviously kha'zix needed Lee driven and you're saying where is Graves if you're putting Lee sin down because of his low when red and high Pickering where's Graves I'm putting Lee sin down just because when I watch zibin Brock sir play it I'm like that's a champion that can do work when I watch most people play Graves I'm like I kind of want to go to sleep and also he has the same winner at 47 there are still issues where I have a 60 70 CS lead and you're only one level ahead of someone who's managed to get a lot of kills here and then you can have more objectives as well so we haven't quite moved the jungle back to the really nice season 12 balance matter that we have I do think we need to do a little bit more shifting there but obviously with MSI they don't want to Tinker too much however we also don't want to swing it back to the hekram meta where it's basically hey this is the only thing you can do and again Grog this is amazing belvoth is amazing yes you can use Kindred Rengar is amazing ailo always has these great picks you can use it's very difficult to quantify which are the best eight so basically use win rates plus play rates and raids to come up with this list as you can see here Plus for my scouting I Scout a hell of a lot every single day I can tell you I see a lot of graves but I'm very rarely going ha that thing should be on this list ahead of all of these other Champions a lot more carry potential and effective style points can be used over here yes I'm aware that hecarim faces the old face but that's because I just couldn't look at the new face anymore I hope you feel the same way they're your best jungles for 13.8 hopefully 13.9 but I'm sure we'll see some more shifts to Once MSI is over don't forget infographic t-list is available via email this weekend on fakai.gg thanks to my politics for once more sponsoring the best jungler series with a new itemization build set and if you want to understand the best Commandments of jungling such that you can use any champion on this list click the video in the Box in the top right ","41":"do you guys think you know who the most broken Champions are going to be for 13.7 you don't bro you know who does me mate I'm the prophet now in today's video guys and this is eids by the way what's going on in today's video 20 most broken champions for 13.7 this is based off the changes that are coming in in 13.7 and also who's strong now because some of these Champions yes won't be actually impacted by anything and they will still continue to be carving up the rift so yeah to know who these 20 Champions are gonna be and because I'm such a nice guy I'll probably give you like a tip for each of them but yeah you can probably also scroll down to the comment section where someone is typing in timestamps the start will be zero zero zero zero the end will be I don't know something like 10 something but yeah anyway guys if you do actually want to improve at this game the timestamps this video is not going to help yeah even if I do give you like one tip it might actually help you but in terms of actual like learning the game and getting better that's what you want to do you want to learn how to play the game not actually how to play a champion like the builds and the runes for sure they might help but they're the setup that stuff you can easily research but it's not actually going to like change how you play a game right yes okay like if you take grasp it's more of like short trading rather than if you take something like conqueror right there are certain specificities there but those the most part I means nothing sign up to the game leap website I coach people to tear climbs on the wreck and I actually upload kind of like condensed highlights from those sessions where I talk about what the student has learned and the key points from the coaching sessions and that's for every single elope by the way even if you're climbing from Master to Challenger Diamond to master gold to platinum bronze to Silver unranked we have everything on our website so check it out links down below alright Guys Without further Ado let's get into the Champions now honestly I think these top two Champions will be the top two in 13.7 these being malified and j4 nothing is actually changing for these Champions by the way well actually something might be for Jarvan so you're actually getting kind of indirectly buffed because with death stands you're actually getting the ability heads back and it's pretty much getting reverted now this Dash you won't get this as maybe like a first you could maybe get it as a second item into the late game with desk dancers j4 especially against those attack damage teams it's a really good item right so j4 is going to be better off and he's already like one of the strongest Champions so malphite is also here guys because of the recent W bus ride if you go frostfire on this guys like unkillable with grasp if you're taking like Comet into a range Champion by the way that's important as well guys if you're playing against someone who you're not going to be able to Auto attack that much please take comment because your Q is actually going to be way more important than your W but yeah malphite j4 I don't think anyone can argue with these two now moving down to the bot Lane here we've got 380 carries on this list now the first of these is jinx because of the recent bus okay especially to your actual attack speed this has made Jinx really strong now other AD carries also like aren't really that good at the moment like can we think of a really OP 80 carry apart from Jinx and the other two I'm gonna mention probably not maybe like travin's a little scary Caitlyn got Gigan earth right ashes like better for sure but is she like op I don't think so like I think Jinx has a lot of free lanes and you can get to the mid to late game your Kraken spike your Infinity Edge Spike and just take over games even if that's with the lethal Tempo Nerf recently that hit every 80 carry same with BT BT isn't even that important on Jinx especially if you play a range and have your screen turned on so she's the first of three Eddie carries number two is Zaya now if you're against a close range Team guys playing Jinx might be a little bit scary in terms of them having engaged right so if they have something like Nautilus j4 Jinx get ready to play that's why you pick Zara even though the champion has got recently nerfed in terms your e in terms of the damage and the cooldown doesn't really matter too much because she counters so much in the bot Lane right now because it's really an Engaged meta desire that is just what you're built for to counter-engage so she's the second 80 carry the third here is twitch and twitch is really here just for the stats I think because I don't know how like strong twitch is in terms of like getting out of Lane and actually playing well because I actually think like during the laning phase it's pretty easy to hard bully him but like I said before I let lots of Lane bullies aren't that good anymore so something like a Caitlyn Draven isn't performing as well as he was he's still very strong but I just think twitch as well kind of like Jinx you can pick this guy and get out of the laning phase into the mid to late game kind of free of charge so here's the third ad carry now moving to the mid lane here we've got three mid laners who are based off attack damage the first of these is action now for Action I kind of mentioned in our Taylor's video I think this guy is really popping off right now like his winner it has actually improved by like half a percent close to a percent in this patch and again I just think it goes back to that engage because action your big kug is just getting out range right and not being able to actually get into the enemy team or it's just too risky to now if you have something like a nautilus on your team in the bot Lane you have something who can create space for you especially with the Enemy team diving into you as long as you you know don't actually just get one shot you can pump out your damage with your passive and of course for the rest of your kid so yeah action in the mid lane as well and same prior amazing Roman potential and really high snowballing potential he has to be here now the other two attack damage mid lane is Talon is here because of the recent bus ride particularly to his actual W's man of course it's really helpful laning effects also dual passive this means that if you can actually play Talon well procking is passive now especially in the mid to late game because it really increased there by like 30 damage that is big you will be getting more kills and yet even in Challenger right now you guys can check the stats he's like an S Plus their Champion close to a 55 win rate pretty nutty so Talons here and the final attack damage mid laner is Yasuo now why is Yasir because he's getting buffed now his shield from his passive is getting buffed and also your a is getting buffed in the sense that you're gonna actually be able to stack this up to four times so maybe like an emacs you asked where it was back this is really scary for Champions than the mid lane particularly those range Champions yes with an emacs being able to deal that damage of 4 Stacks if you're playing something like a syndra and orianna watch out for yes in 13.7 but let's just say you want to play a magic damage dealing mid laner well Annie is the best guys even though she is getting nerfed but Annie's support is getting nerfed because her is getting nerfed mid lane Annie you don't care about your e as long as your Q is going to be dealing the same damage as long as Tibbers are still like unkillable and you can put your e on him even if he is getting nerfed like who cares Annie in the mid lane is just such a big Force right now and she will be in 13.7 kind of like I said for Action right over close range stuff and he loves it so yeah if you need a bit of magic damage in the mid lane Annie is definitely the best pick now moving into the jungle here another champion who loves close range fights this is belveder and a close range meta yes this champion from the void is just the ultimate void monster an ultimate Rift monster at the moment don't know what that was but yeah but it's true right like he won Champions to jump into this is why belveder for most Halos is like an S Plus their Champion really good win rates and honestly I could see why people would want to ban this Champion super annoying now Echo is another annoying Champion who's got a pretty like decent band riding take rate in the majority of elos and the reason being is because he's just unlikely strong right now and has been for ages also because of all the engage at the moment Echo loves it especially if you have some sort of like support with setup right or your teammates have set up Echo really enjoys this also the ability has recently that got put into Nash's tooth is just better for you so Echo is here and that's the same for Evelyn as well not in terms of Nash's tooth but just being innately strong the bus I think that came in towards the end of season 12 right pretty sure that was Evelyn Buffs Evelyn has just been frothing it since she's as plaster and every single Halo and I know I may have said that for a lot of these Champions but that's why this is like a top 20 Champions countdown like these Champions are going to be on this list and Evelyn just like Echo she is innately broken so she's going to be here as well now moving to the Top Lane I know we talked about malphite earlier but that's because I think he's like almost the Undisputed number one Champion these ones might be a little bit more disputed but specifically like for your own Riven here death stands getting the ability hates back is amazing for you like these champions in the mid to late game particularly something like a Riven rifle the ability hey she'll be getting that's if you go Gore Drinker actually but most ribbons here are going Eclipse which is really why she's here as well and anyone who has played against like Eclipse ravenous Hydra Riven knows how broken this stuff is so Riven has to be here same with Fiora as well gross the undying Mana flow Scorch that stuff is all still there and because tanks are getting played a little bit more Fiora just has to be there she crushes so many champions at the moment so that's why she's in this video and yeah the other top laner here being Jax the hockey stick how can I not put him on this video guys he's got to be here broken we have to mention Jax now moving down to the bot Lane three supports four supports actually look at this well let's have a party first of all we have blitzcrank if you guys want to Snowball the bot Lane out of control best Champion to pick by flowers Blitz like if I was playing support 100 I'm picking this dude he counters so many things and even like kind of hook Champions he does very well against something like a bike you can end up blow up something like a thresh you can instant blur up and these are pretty popular Champions also enchantresses lad one rocket grab boom goes the bot Lane boom goes the game you're gonna carry now Nautilus is the other one so if you want to play like a budget blitzcrank but not yeah I don't actually think it's like a budget Bliss he's a very very strong champion because of the Buffs at the start of the Season 13 to him especially to your passive damage and annual ease damage as well this has made his all wins even better and yeah no it's got to be hit does really well into a lot of Champions right one of these Champions is up next this being Santa Santa is an unreal Champion guys if you're playing against passive laners because you pretty much outscale everything right and Santa's power has also been enhanced recently by those Buffs that came in whether it was to like your actual attack speed whether it's to like your ultimate space damage and its cooldown which is great for a validity Center which is yet probably the best way to play off you can even go stuff like hostile which is really obnoxious but it's actually pretty good yeah there's just a bunch of stuff you can do on this champion and yeah like I mentioned she does so well into a lot of passive Lanes which is still pretty popular so if you see stuff like I don't know Janna if you see stuff like Lulu Sona saraga like enchantress are being picked Senna doesn't even matter who your ID carrier is just lock her in and the last support guys is Recon now this one is probably like the most blind pickable support because in terms of counter picking Recon it's pretty difficult the champion doesn't really have like many hard counters if any and counters a lot of things and just innately speaking like we talked earlier about how Echo and Evelyn right it doesn't really matter what happens to the meta these champers will be very good because they're strong rakana is in exactly the same boat the bus in season 13 have made this do so good especially with zai being better as well pushes him up into the top tier now the final Champion guys to talk about here this is kind of like a off-road one not really sure what I mean by that but yeah like low-key broken type thing that most people I don't think have realized how broken this will be and yeah if you have enjoyed the video guys please leave a like down below and also make sure to leave a comment with your thoughts on this video I'd love to hear what you have to say but yeah the final Champion to mention Heroes kha'zix now if you're a carsex manual when you commenting if you actually like the adjustments now the adjustments are as follows your eyes are arrangeled the enemy Champion's isolation it's gonna be smaller which means you can actually be closer to them and get your isolation I think this is massive because all your damage is pretty much your isolation like that is the raw damage for Galaxy your W slow getting Nerf who really cares about this it's still going to be slowing them enough for you to actually do what you want to do and in terms of the game itself like a kha'zix w evolve like you know slowing someone for 80 90 like is that actual healthy for the game of course not right like you're an assassin you don't need a slow that does that and if if you really do have like just a w of all finish you can go something like surilda's garage as well but yeah also your ultimate lasting longer so you can use the second and third charges I think it's really really good yes kha'zix might not be amazing at the moment but these bus I think are gonna put him in the top 20 Champions I think it's a pretty fair assessment what do you guys think let me know Down Below guys thank you so much for watching the video I will see you in our next season 13 upload this is peace foreign ","42":"what's up gameweepers you hard stock clamp players now in this video we're going to be going through 10 top laners right who are going to be open 13.8 now there might be some other Champions who are good right this is not like the be-all and end-all of Top Lane is you've got to play these are champions are just going to be strong objectively now in this video we're going to give you like the runes and the builds and all that but I'm also going to give you a tip or maybe a few tips for each Champion when you do actually come around to picking them so make sure guys you stick around for the whole video to know what those tips are going to be but hold on a second guys because we have to have a quick chat I think we all know and love that League of Legends is a free game sometimes you don't want to have to break the bank in order to actually enjoy your free time however that isn't the case for every game right now and some AAA titles are insanely expensive I for one don't want to pay those prices and I'm willing to bet that you guys don't either but thankfully our new sponsor g2a is here to help you guys out g2a is a website that has hundreds of games all at discounted prices it doesn't matter what kind of game you want to play they have options for you they've got titles ranging from GTA to the last of us to Daisy and much much more and if you guys are looking to score a deal on some League skins they even have codes for RP there and there's no better time than right now because g2a is running an insane spring sale with some stuff being up to 98 off so don't miss out on this opportunity click the link in the description and save today now starting off at number 10 I mean it's not really a countdown I'm just gonna give you 10 top laners so you guys maybe can make your own list in the comment section who you think's gonna be broken in terms of the order but yeah the first Champion we're going to talk about is Canon so if you need a bit of AP in the Top Lane picking Cannon is good because of the bus racingly right Canon has been really really strong especially in high reloads and these stats that you see on your screen right now these are from Challenger across the world now a couple of tips for Canon right one of the most important things on this Champion is using your actual enhanced Auto attack from your W because this deal was more damage and also applies a mark of the storm then you can actually activate your W shred away you want to be trying to time this so if you want to attack minions three times you then get this empowered Auto attack this is where you want to pressure the enemy Champion as much as possible during the laning phase it's a really nice way just like keep poking them down and also in Canada guys think about using the brushes as much as possible in the Top Lane most matchups you're going to be going against a melee Champion so if you can keep them out of the brushes they really have nowhere to hide also in terms you're spacing it's really important that you try to space that key cool down the enemy Champion will have as much as possible so if you're against Darren it's about spacing his apprehend if you're again something like maybe a Jax it's about saving your e for when he jumps in right and also maybe your W so you can stun him straight away so specific Champions with gap closers you have to be a little bit careful of but those are really the key points to playing a good ninja in the Top Lane so Kenneth is the first Champion now if you want to play a much more simple well I don't actually think the ship is that easy but yeah in terms of being strong cyan is probably the best top laner in terms of tanks in the Top Lane for 13.8 simply because malphite's getting nerfed now malfo could easily be here but I just decided to put sign because now sign if you are new to playing this Champion he is actually kind of difficult to well just learn I guess in terms of using your abilities and learning like kind of a hitbox of your Cube also using queue guys like it's important to try to use your Q of your e so if you can land your E when the enemy Champion is going for a CS you land the slow ride then it's pretty much well not guaranteed but there's a much better chance of you Landing your Q right so these are a couple of really important concepts for site also using your W in terms of wave clear but also blocking the enemy Champions kind of like key source of damage this can also be a useful tip and of course guys like when you recall and you hit Level six if you have your TP up you can always think of olding through mid or even ball Lane bot Lane probably better because it's just a longer Lane ride and then after that play happens and you Snowball the ball Lane so then TP back top super strong tank and 13.8 consider picking your next patch a champion who probably destroys cyan on lots of Chambers on this list this is vain but vayne doesn't have the highest win rates guys simply because she's difficult to play around like if you make one or two mistakes in terms of your spacing positioning you're gonna get dubstep right and the reason you're picking vein is to win the side lane is to win the 1v1 and the split push right which is actually really doable at the moment because of those stupid bus ride gave up but just a couple of tips when you're playing vanguards in the Top Lane one of the most important things right because you're going to win the 1v1 you kind of like automatically have pressure in any Lane you're against right it's actually just tracking the enemy jungler this is really what's going to get you cocked more than anything now of course there are going to be 1v1 situations where the enemy Champion might have chances if you do stuff up so in terms of maybe saving your Q or having your finger on the ready for your condemn against a champion like a Jax right he jumps in you just press e what is that Jack's going to do that's why Jace is so good against Jax because you switch to a hammer form and knock him away he can't do anything afterwards this applies to a lot of top laners but most top laners are just going to be linear Champions they just run in a straight line with no Gap closes this might be a Darius right who he mentioned this might be a Garen as well there are a bunch of other Champions so the way you kind of lose against them is actually just getting 2V1 dollar so make sure you are putting a war down at the end of the second wave make sure you know where the enemy jungler starts make sure before you even show maybe when you get back to Lane put a control wall down in the river brush or try brush cover yourself even be careful of Lane ganking right this is going to be the real big cuck for you when you're playing something like Lane top now one of those linear champions in 13.0 you guys can pick as Garen because of the bus that are coming into it his base ideas going up his base armor is going up this is going to make his laning phase good and that's what we're talking about here Top Lane remaining phase okay so Gary is going to be stronger now what tips do I have for Garen well here's what you're gonna do bro you're gonna spin around mate and you probably win the lane now but honestly guys there maybe are like a couple of tips probably using your W right when you're going to get damaged kind of like the same thing for Scion using your Q for Minions that are probably hard to get the movement speed is really useful as well right but again it's just about realizing that you are Garen and you don't really have any sort of escape from ganks so your Q giving you movement speed is important your W as well for the tankiness ride but it's mostly just about playing cooldowns when the enemy Champions on cooldown you can look to make plays when you're on cooldown you should probably look to just be passive but yeah guarantor playing in 13.0 because that's going to be better now another champion is going to be really strong in 13.8 this is Olaf despite him getting Nerf recently right so they nerfed what it's like passive attack speed and his cues damage it's still really fine for the early life because the nurse went massive they're not just like you know cutting his legs off they're kind of little Jabs to it so he's still going to be really good because he was insanely strong beforehand now keys to playing oh laptop your Mana pool is pretty much everything if you are going to use your Q like on repeat off cooldown you're trolling bro like you're gonna be earned by level two what you guys want to do is use your cue for certain things right like the actual deliberate I don't know like whether it's a minion or the enemy Champion's going for a last hit or something particularly if you're stronger at level one so the enemy Champion might be running something like flash and TP you have flashing ghost to Zoloft so you can just run them down even at level one when they go for us yes but when you are the weaker champion because lots of people might think I'm playing oh life I've got to be like super aggro that's true but on any Champion you are going to come back to Lane where it might be shoving into you the enemy jungle might be in fog so you have to chill for a little bit so just sometimes understand you might have to relax and farm it range with your queue and just let the wave come into you not all the time you have to be that raging Viking now one of the most Lane dominant champions in the game is coming in next this is Jace now because of those random busts that they gave him kind of like Olaf right where they buff like your base damage and God knows what else like your W's damage maybe even your Q's base damage I think it was Jason's just going to be in definitely on this countdown guys that's just the way it is but when you're playing Jason the Top Lane you guys have to understand that your melee form you rarely want to be using this bro like honestly unless you think you can severely chunk an enemy champion and there's no counter play so like after that trade happens right if you jump in as Chase so you go in in your melee form you cue them you Auto attack them and then you knock them away if you're playing against something like a Jax or a Darius with ghost or Riven ride with gap closing potential they can chase you down and one shot you after that what Jace is about really is just persistent damage I guess or even burst damage if you can see an opportunity to queue or QE or something right in your range form but just keeping the enemy champion at Bay at arm's length range Champions against melee champers you guys should have an inherent Advantage right so all you have to do is use it you really want to be saving your Hammer form and your knockback but when the enemy Champion actually looks to jump on you again like I mentioned before with vayne with her condemn Jace with his knockback it's such a big cut to these Champions so keep that in mind when you're playing this dude has a footage for hextech Darius is the next Champion guys he's still so good and has been ever since the 1210 durability matter hit the rift and tips for Darius in the top plane well it's just important to know that maybe your W is an auto attack reset that's going to put out that DPS quicker also in terms of using your q and E right whenever you e an enemy Champion using your Q straight away it is guaranteed to hit also using your e is useful against Champions to actually stop them in an animation so it might be like a Riven third Q it might be a Jax with his e-ride you can time that e it will stop them and interrupt that ability these are important things to consider but yeah your e is really going to be the make or break of a laning phase if you're using this like on repeat you're gonna go um so quickly so you want to be saving this for the enemy Champions key called out now for your guys is one of three campers we have left here and fourth Fiora with grassly undying manaflown Scorch this Champion's got to be here she's like s plus two in every single ELO still which is kind of annoying because she's been here so long and that goes for a lot of these chamfers but anyway Fiora in the Top Lane is super good right now now in 13.8 what are some tips I can give you for playing Fiora while resetting your vitals is a good idea so running out of vision of the enemy champion and coming back if it's unfavorable for example the vital might be right behind the enemy Champion it's like impossible to proc right run out of vision providing you're not going to miss Cs and then come back and the fighter will be in a better position for you also remember that your e is an auto attack researchers like darius's w so in terms of trading if you're actually going to like go in for an all-in or an extended trade you can cue in Auto attack and then press your e and then you'll Auto attack them straight away and also in terms of your W guys remember it slows the attack speed of Champions you don't just have to use your W to repost or Parry that key ability of course it's important in some matchups right like against a Camille with a hook shot or a Riven with a third Q or stun you want to try to anticipate these things but when you have big kill pressure and you don't need it for that reason you can use it to slow the enemy champion and their attack speed now speaking of attack speed Jax is number two guys so I would honestly put Jackson like the top two top players here he's just been by someone else but for Jackson 13.8 with Sandra shojin I don't know like bulk if you want to go this Frozen Heart later sonja's with the new Apu Jax has got to be here these stats and challenge her career you can see a 55 win rate get me out just for Jax uh just picked Jackson you should be sweet now moving to number one guys this Champion you could lock her in and probably still win a bit like I said for Jax you guys actually want a Jack's tip like I don't know man you can try to think of maybe using like when you're level six for instance using your actual like enhanced Auto attack off minions so Auto attack a minion once and then jump onto the enemy Champion with your W proc like this will deal half their HP yeah that's all you need actually but yeah the number one Champion guys in the Top Lane for 13.8 I think it's going to be Riven and really continues to be yes this Champion is harder to play than pretty much every other champion on this countdown but if you can play her at the highest level she's just nutty look at these stats and Challenger for me S Plus to a 52 win rate at least a 52 win rate that's if you can play it though right so a couple of important tips here animation canceling is key right so make sure you guys practice this when you use your cues you want to be hovering your mouse over the enemy Champion not pass them or around them on top of them your Q will always land on them at that point then we want to input a movement command so click somewhere around the enemy champion and then Auto attack them instantly this will actually cancel the animation and speed up your combo another important thing that kind of like separates I've coached a bunch of like Master ribbon players these guys compared to Challenger ribbons They Don't Really Auto attack that much they kind of like cue in and W and then e out and that's it you want to use your passive guys your passive is everything on this Champion a great Rhythm player most of the time anyway is going to start that combo with an auto attack or if they have to like Q in they're going to weave in Auto attacks with that combo that's DPS that's conqueror stacking that's damaged that's Challenger so guys thank you so much for watching this video if you did enjoy this video by the way where I'm actually giving you like hopefully concrete applicable tips let us know by leaving a like down below and maybe a comment saying this was actually a nice change or you'd like to see more of this in the future but yeah thank you so much for watching I will see you in our next season 13 upload the spinnings peace ","43":"in the world of League or any mainstream competitive game whenever you hear the word meta it usually refers to what Champions items or strategies are most effective at their current moment subsequently there's this unspoken notion that players have to formulate their gameplay and perspective around it that has come and go all the time as bounce patches or player Discovery Alters how we understand the game but there are times in history when a meta has become so overbearingly dominant that harboring even the slightest desire to do anything else bordered on intentionally trying to lose the game gauge supports that can also use the art of sansster playing into artist sensor and when sues plus the art sensor art sensor though starting to turn the fight yeah let's talk about the artist sensor having been around for 12 years at this point there have been plenty of instances where we had to encounter these tier zero strategies or builds that siphoned all Summons of enjoyment out of the game sometimes for months or even years at a time so today we're going to go through some of the most toxic methods throughout League's 12 years of release going on 13 explaining why they were so pervasive and their lasting effects on the game Hereafter to preface what I'll be doing in this video is give a brief rundown of a few metas what they were about what caused them how they have to the game for better or worse usually worse and then give my thoughts on why they were so problematic and what could have been done to prevent them I'm also going to refrain from any super super old stuff like Sunfire Evelyn because that's like season Zero season one kind of stuff and also I am not going to refer to single Champion dominance like when affilios made everyone question their sanity when he was first released so let's get to it but really quickly I just want to let you guys know that I partnered up with Apex gaming PCs and released the line of gaming computers for anyone looking to upgrade their Hardware this holiday season Apex offers cutting-edge budget and high-end rigs that are fully customizable and made on the spot so you don't have

capital to pay all at once definitely suggest you check it out if you feel like treating yourself this holiday season but for now let's get back into the video [Music] foreign things are going to be a bit different today usually you're supposed to save the best for last but I'm going to start with the First with no caveat no asterisk no ifs ands or buts the most toxic meta to ever played League of Legends at least to me would have to go to the dreaded audience sensor the premise of this item was very simple and as a niche item supports a go4 if their team possessed a lot of Auto attackers like Master Yi kogman Jacks that kind of stuff while the stats are rather gold efficient and everything you would want to have on enchanters the specificity of it is what kept it in check it was strictly for audit damage during the preseason however a new effect was given to it where it would heal you equal to the bonus on hit damage so one from an HP damage to an HP drain essentially doubling the value of the buff going from a net 20 damage to a net 40 in damage and healing interestingly this alone didn't draw too much attention it wasn't until version 7.2 when Arden sensor got another massive buff increasing the scaling from 20 flat to 20 to 35 based on level almost double and remember we're talking 70 bonus damage in essence from the heels one other thing is that the healing wasn't even based on damage it was just a flat amount your opponent could have 9 000 magic resist and you would still heal for 20 to 35 HP per hit now imagine if you were a kog'maw with runan's hurricane every single Auto would heal you for 105 HP so long as he wasn't cc'd he was pretty much Invincible the sheer overwhelming power this item granted was able to overshadow the Nish usage of it it didn't matter if your team didn't have a lot of Auto attackers attack speed on a damage on his sustain in tandem without gold deficiency item was in stats alone made this one of the most overtuned items in the history of League art and sensor would remain a stable presence throughout all of season 7 and as we entered that year's World Championship Riot would release a quote-unquote balance patch that sought to Nerf the item's capacity by reducing 20 to 35 scaling to a flat 25 on both attack speed and health trade technically this is a Nerf in the late game but they compensated by making it stronger in the early game defeating the purpose of the Nerf altogether every match boiled down to whichever team could rush out in censor first 80 carries would go relish she'll start to give this support as much gold as possible solely to purchase this item top jungle and mid were all but Irrelevant for the most part especially in solo queue patch 7.19 would eventually remove the healing component but replace it with the buff that is granted to do both the support and their teammate and then in version 7.21 which I believe was right before preseason the attack speed and on it damage were completely gutted finally ending the cursed item's reign of terror what's really strange about this meta is that for how all consuming it was it lasted for an extremely long time practically an entire season players were quick to abuse odd and censor long before worlds began yet there was no response bear in mind Grievous wounds wasn't upgraded from 2540 to 4060 until season 11's Mythic items so there was no effective and easy way to stop art and sensor let alone everything else Champion had to offer such action or lack thereof would be uncharacteristic in this day and age the moment anything becomes tier zero it gets nerfed almost immediately I actually believe that was due to hardened sensor if you think about it ever since then right would be really quick to pull the trigger on nerfing a strong item Rune or Champion into Oblivion in a matter of weeks which I think is too hasty but I'd much rather that than the alternative the issue behind this was simple they wanted to make Garden sensor more of a worthwhile purchase but the way they went about that was incorrect by adding on hit healing they negated what kept out and sends a niche in the first place I think the current iteration was the right way to go about it where it would Grant the Boost to both parties considering most enchantments are arranged they're likely to weave in Auto attacks while waiting for their abilities to come back up even after being reduced to a shadow of his former self Arden sensor is still ridiculously gold efficient providing up to 3.74 times more value than their cost if you can give this stock to your entire team at the same time for some enchanters that's Child's Play like Sona Soraka and Janna While others can make it happen through a combination of moonstone renewer and font of life now they think about it wow it's been five years since audience sensor holy crap [Music] up next we're going to go back further in time to a more archaic generational League of Legends roughly 10 years ago the Black Cleaver meta Black Cleaver as you know is a staple item a Cornerstone of the vast majority of diet diverse juggernauts a few skirmishers assassins and even marksmen on my garden censor it's retained its identity from the start of its conception way back in season 1 to now who granted attack damage health and cooldown reduction now known as stability haste upon dealing physical damage it would reduce the armor of a Target by a percentage stacking up to a cap what made this item a staple in so many champions was how all purpose it was armor is a stat president on every member of the cast from the squishiest enchanters to the most durable tanks therefore this item's passive will always be useful to varying degrees the attack damage and ability haste makes it exceptionally useful on any ability casters but even Champions to deal the bulk of their damage through Auto attacks can make it work since Otto's are physical attacks at the end of the day a long time ago though Black Cleaver stats used to be 250 Health 50 attack damage 10 cooldown reduction and most notably 15 flat armor penetration the kicker is that the armor shark component was not a unique passive as you can see on screen it just said passive meaning you could build multiple black labors and get the full benefits of each one what happens was that each black Cleaver would apply stack so in theory with enough black Cleavers you would get Max shred on a target with one attack the average non-tank champ back then would have somewhere between 80 to 100 armor so 30 shred would bring you down to 55-70 then you would have 90 flat armor penetration meaning versus any squishy Target you basically did true damage I believe at the time there was also the Mastery Sunder which gave you another 5 armor pen and weapon expertise which was another eight percent so to tally it all up at five black Cleavers assuming installed boots who would gain 1250 bonus South 250 pounds attack damage 40 CDR 95 flat armor penetration and by your fourth Black Cleaver any auto attack or damaging ability would instantly shred 30 the target's armor any and every physical damage dealer in the game would just run Black Cleaver it's true damage like even against tanks it would basically do true damage at least without an sensor the only ones who built it were supports and the occasional iron jungle or Karma top but during preseason 2013 and early season 3 everyone was running Black Cleaver the only counter play against someone stacking Black Cleaver was to stack black Cleavers yourself or stack age HP using his armor was practically useless fun fact Blackley vermetta was partially responsible for admob's meta shortly after as it had the same basic principle but instead of making your target squishy you made yourself Invincible the very first patch of season 3 would attempt to slow down Black Cleaver stacking by reducing the stats and needing to get 5 Stacks instead of four but ultimately in version 3.9 they act the entire thing by applying only one stack of armor shred in a single instance all traces of black Cleavers abusability would then be shut down in season 5 where they would remove the flat armor penetration altogether black Labor's escalation was mostly a design oversight as the item on its own was perfectly balanced it's just they never thought to consider what would happen if someone tried to build multiple copies of it I'm pretty sure the black believer meta is what would eventually give rise to the practice of applying unique passes to everything to prevent this ready issue from happening in their future although it would be interesting if rabidon's dead cap could stack thank you so much money moving on for the next meta let's go forward in time to season eight now by this point I think the trauma from past escapades has gone up to Riot and they would develop this Zero Tolerance policy for anything that compromise build diversity or fostered a degenerate experience or league but that doesn't mean they thought things through they would clean up the mess after they made it but that wouldn't stop them from making a mess in the first place and one of them was kleptomancy meta spawning shortly after the root system overhaul in pre-season 8. also known as rootsuite forged the idea was to make runes a more central part of a Champion's gameplay by having Keystone set directly influence their playstyle for example a predator would give you a speed boost for your first attack or a face rush for making more slippery during combat kleptomancy was drawn up to encourage brief traits with your opponent strike fast and get out hopefully with a little something extra it operated in a Spellbook fashion where upon using an ability your next basic attack with grand bonus gold and a chance for a consumable item ranging from potions to Wards to free Hotel shampoo size elixirs or just more gold on very rare occasions you would even get an elixir of skill which would allow you to rank of an ability as if you leveled up which was insanely broken players got on to what was essentially free gold and any Champion with a low cooldown low meta possibility who could apply on hit effects from a safe distance or without much commitment would run klepto coincidentally many of these Champions also happen to have rather poor early games and or a way to Pokey for those items further incentivizing than to take this rune for one simple goal to reach their late game Power Spike faster and more safely so Champions like Fiora Gangplank kale as Sewell with Q spam on you or you spam for kale during laning phase continuously racking up Golden free items allowing them to scale faster without having to take any substantial risk at the start klepto was very overtuned some players were averaging almost 1500 to 2 000 golden free stuff by 10 to 12 minutes so in version 8.2 they significantly reduce the moon's drop rate in the early game and decreased it even further after 15 minutes while this did lower the efficiency of klepto it still didn't prevent players from abusing it since you know free gold is three gold so in version 8.23 they have the drop rate again and split it across two Auto attacks trying to bring the went back to its intended purpose of rewarding short burst traits not poke damage even so that still didn't stop players from using it as a poke tool Capri season 10 klepto was replaced to a prototype omnistone arguably the most pointless Rune in the game which I actually made a video on if you're interested in its defense kleptomancy wasn't as pervasive as Black Cleaver or Autumn sensor it's not like everyone was using it in every game the problem was the Champions who did ran it were using it to bypass their most vulnerable point the early game it doesn't make for a fun experience when you're a Garen and the enemy GP can just keep spam on you over and over and over at Novus to his own life and have two items by 20 minutes while you're stuck in one just by playing laning Phase it would eventually swap out prototype omnisone first strike a keystone that still some are prone to being abused by poke Champs but more proportionally rewards those who go for quick trades like burst Mages or assassins foreign last one then I know the video is running kind of long so I'll make it brief this is probably one many of you have been waiting for me to talk about season five to Seven's tank meta humorously we're on the precipice of another potential tank meta entering season 13 with the new tank item changes that followed after the durability update from season 5 to around season 7 there was an ostensible lack of damage sounds crazy I know with all the damage we've been exploding to over the past like five years this also coincided with tank items being exceptionally over tuned to giving rise to the deadly combo of Sunfire keep or cinderholk if you're a jungler I spawn Gauntlet and spirit Visage around the same time tank busting items were few and far between not just in terms of Champions items like last whisper were horribly inefficient early on and most Champions didn't have the base deaths to survive tanks additionally this was still back when we were in the old Mastery system so we didn't have runes like cut down conqueror Etc meanwhile tank set the Keystone Mastery courage of the Colossus which is basically the femble winter Shield pass that we have today this Universal absence of damage reached a Breaking Point in 2017 when hauntzer famously retained over 30 Tower shots in one team fight on Nautilus and survived kranti who was supported by Lee sin and Nami but it goes to show you how excessively overtuned defensive stats were and install the console was playing malphite and had six armor items he just had Sunfire Cape frozen heart and ninja tabbies alongside standard tanks like Nautilus maokai sejuani gragas many vgus were also targeted at tanks Poppy shanghalio and Warwick non-tank Champions would also dab on this combo to see how far they would go giving rise to the infamous tank Echo tank Fizz tank akali tang nidalee and so on where they would rely on their base damage and defensive abilities to slowly but surely beat you down over time since most of them were assassins a simple numbers change like reducing their base damage in favor more scaling would do the trick again just like Arden sensor and Black Cleaver this was never really a tier zero meta where all five members of one team were playing tanks mostly just top laners and occasionally junglers which is why the metal lasted for almost two years before it was eventually phased out but much of what made tag matter so problematic was The Lager counterplay for it items runes or even stuff like how much damage turrets would do actually if you notice season 7 is roughly around the time when we would see a noticeable increase in percent Health damage or true damage on new Champions Kane orn Zoe kaisa Pike sort of Silas depending on the ultimate Yumi Kiana Sana sent Lilia yonez so on and so forth I'll have a modicum of percent Health damage or true damage via current health missing health or Max Health consequently that would result in an arguably more degenerate span of time where everyone was getting one shot at left and right regardless of if you were a tank or a Soraka Riot has a tendency to over correct on things the dynamic between how much damage a tank should be able to withstand and how much damage a carry should be able to deal Ebbs and flows all the time right now we're just recovering from that and maybe entering another tank matter come season 13 but I have a feeling it won't be as prominent as last time even though I criticized ride a lot for struggling to learn from their mistakes and by no means saying they never learn it's interesting to see the long-term effects those toxic Menace had on the game art and sensor meta is what made Riot pull the trigger on nerfing overpowered items more quick Black Cleaver meta is one made right at unique passes to every item so you only have reason to buy one of them Tech meta is one main new Champions and reworks have a lot of tank busting in their kit and tank busting items and runes became more accessible we all like to complain about how far gone the game is now and it is but it will be completely false to say the past wasn't filled with its own share of catastrophes okay video is running long my throat hurts so we're gonna add things off here in my opinion Arden sends a matter Reigns Supreme as the most toxic meta in the game's history but I know many League Boomers who would argue Black Cleaver meta was even worse let me know in the comments which meta you think was the worst or if you believe there is something even worse than the 4i covered today I know there's still a ton of other metas I missed like Banner of command but we'd be here

Platinum and above for 13.7 and yeah like I just said man this video is not going to do anything for you in terms of improving bro like I don't care if you're picking Teemo jungle or rakan Top Lane it doesn't matter man like you actually know how to play the role of course not right so if you actually want to play the game at a high level guys and just pick anything like it doesn't matter what's in this video bro like if you can play Your Role effectively like 80 carries it's all about range right and keeping One champion in your auto attack range pretty much at all times and staying healthy while dealing the most damage right these are just Concepts and kind of techniques if you will that we can teach you and we have so many resources on our website at gameweave.com that will help you to do just that so stop being hard stuck get unclamped and yes sign up to the website for exclusive access to our library of content upload it to daily buyer Challenger players and coaches from around the world and let's get into the 15 most broken for 13.7 according to the stats and yeah in Platinum and above coming in at number 15 I'm kind of she's surprised by this is Veigar in the mid lane now I don't know what you guys are doing a and Louis he was like are you guys picking stuff that's really bad against Vega when you see him in Champs like are you guys just forgetting that his cage kind of has like a long-ish cooldown and you should just play around that are you forgetting that he's absolutely doctored because of the nurse to his q and W like the AP ratios in this like I don't get why he's on this list maybe it's because lots of Champions at the moment are close range and Vega like especially in the bot Lane right and Vega does very well against them because of yes his Event Horizon but I'm still pretty perplexed by this if someone wants an explanation in the comments like just unleash bro like explain to me why Vega despite getting like some pretty big Nerfs is op and platinum and above now a champion who I can actually believe is being good and op at the moment is for your work coming in at number 14 and even in Platinum and above where people might not get like the max juice out of this Champion she's still doing very well picked in over 33 000 games and to have over a 50 win rate is definitely respectable more respectable than Vega and I guess this patch as well with the new death stance which is now giving you ability host which you probably appreciate more than it actually giving you more attack damage and armor because you're still getting enough of those two stats getting ability has now reducing your cooldowns in the late game that's just like really good for fjora and I'm guessing that's why her win rate has actually probably improved since 13.7 it's summoner's Rift now coming in at number 13 a champion who's well win rate hasn't really improved that much but she has stayed at the S Plus to category S Plus tier level this being Evelyn in the jungle so if you guys want to go invis after level 6 and just make the enemy team to their hair out and ban Evelyn for the rest of their lives pick this Champion really really good though guys if you can pick Evelyn when you have like a lot of attack damage in your team because if you have a lot of AP what your magic damage will just become less valuable right when you ideally want to pick everyone is when you do have an ad mid particularly a strong early game mid laner maybe something like a Pantheon an irelia Renekton and top these type of Champions because they can allow you to actually jungle properly without getting invaded and hardstormed and yeah scale them to a game for free so kind of important in terms of Team compositions but it doesn't matter like if you're playing this in lower elos you're gonna hard Stone brigado award Champions are picked and because the bus I think they're at the end of season 12 to Evelyn she's really been here ever since so unless she gets nerfed I can see her being on this countdown indefinitely and that might be the same for Darius as well guys a champion who's banned in 20 of games but he's still played in close to 40 000 one of the highest for the top players if not the highest and he's still an S plus two Champion Gary's because he does so well into so many top laners and that's really been the case since 12.10 hit the rift that durability matter and yeah extended fighting that is what this auction general just loves he loves it when the fights go long because you get that Henry stacking you get the Conqueror stacking your DPS is unreal also with ghosts the scaling this has as well into a game two combat Summoner spells we could also talk about the TP change from last year as well so there's a bunch of things here going for Darris and a bit like Evelyn unless this guy actually gets directly nerfed I think he'll be on this list pretty much forever now coming in at number 11 moving to the mid lane this is Annie so even though Annie got nerfed in 13.7 the good news for Annie in the mid lane is that your e doesn't really matter all too much yes it will hit you right like as you actually start putting points in this but it doesn't matter too much because you're all about well just matching your queue first and getting off those one short combos your e doesn't really do much for you so for any means to be picked in close to 20 000 games and they still have close to a 53 win rate this is the second highest win rate on this video it's just kind of impressive but yeah also like op so I wouldn't be surprised if again in 13.8 and you received more nerf because of the stats that we're looking at now the highest win rate guys on this video is coming in at number 10 and we're staying in the mid lane here this being anivia so I know the Catalyst of Aeons now is 1300 gold the point here is that anivia is just incredibly broken regardless of kind of what happens to our items like if we think about Ryan's right he's actually kind of like falling off because of the nurse around him to his items but a Nivea if you're doing something like Lee Andrews you can go everfrost you can even go something like crown of the Shadow Queen you don't even have to go role of Ages and yeah once you actually do get serious Embrace that's when the fun really begins on this Champion also a new year is just so good against close range Champions right running into her a bit like vegar in a way maybe like a budget version but yeah she's just innately stronger because Vega has copped so many nerves recently so nevia kind of the same thing right The Meta at the moment is so good for her and in the mid lane there aren't many champions who are really scary for you if someone's picking like zarath or velcos they're not really picked all too much but yeah I would just recommend Banning one of those long range artillery magers so you can actually play the game now coming in at number nine one of the best all-round champions in the game and all-around supports in the game is rakan and he's actually picked an over 12 percent of game series like the most popular support at the moment and to have over a 52 and a half percent win rate look at this for me this is an over 64 000 games it's actually kind of nuts so if you guys aren't picking rakan like if you're a support player you've got to be trolling bro like this Champion is clearly op and there's no doubt in my mind that he will get an earth next patch if this keeps up now staying in the bot Lane one of three A.D carries on this list this is Draven so if you guys want to play a dominant early game 80 Carriage draven's probably the pick here right because well nothing is really going to stop you at the moment like Caitlyn got nerfed what else is there like Samira really isn't as good as she was yes her passive kind of got like semi-reverted and therefore buffed a few patches ago but apart from that like Draven is chilling like you're gonna get out of the early game and get to the mid to late game super far ahead and yeah with the actual matter at the moment being engaged that's what you really appreciate because you can land all of your abilities right and get more Auto attacks off so drayven being here I think it just makes sense he's Banning close to 20 a game so obviously ad carries still feel as if this guy has a problem and he certainly is they're saying in the bot Lane the second best support guys according to these stats in 13.7 is milio and this little kid despite cop in a bit of hot fixing still has a very impressive win rate close to 51 and he's picked in over 14 of games and banned in over 24 which means that in total he's been picked in close to 75 000 matches and it probably is that point by the time this video has been released and I think it really just goes to show how strong he is because he gets counted by so many things like if you pick blitzcrank into him or Nautilus like a hard engager if you pick something that outranges him like it's pretty much impossible to actually play the game as milio so if you pick something like a velcos xyra might be annoying Santa is definitely better than milio hard counters because you just outscale so there are certain matchups that are really difficult so familiar to be number seven on this countdown he has to be op now number six on this list despite the recent Nerfs to her like directly so we're talking about Zaya here to a blade cooler to her e hasn't really deterred Ira by being peaked in close to a hundred thousand matches and to have an 18.6 pick rate 18.6 band right you still got close to a 51 winner like she's gonna be picked and banned in MSI I think there needs to be like a lot more 80 carries either brought up to a level or as I just pushed down a little bit she does so well into the meta kind of like what I was saying for and if you're in Vega if something is running into you and engaging onto usia that's where you thrive that's what the matter is right now so zai number six number five an Eddie Carey who doesn't actually really appreciate that too much is jinx but Jinx is so innately busted like picked in over 140 000 games close to a 27 pick rate and to have almost a 10 higher pick rate than Zaya and almost half a percent a better win rate like you're joking mate like this Champion there's no way she's going into the MSI this strong I think she will also get a Nerf the reason Buffs especially to her attack speed right I just pushed up over the edge so I think she's definitely gonna get in there she's way too good at the moment with the crack and sire Infinity yet Spike as well you know how it's 40 crit now but you actually get the pattern from Infinity Edge it's too good on this Champion man also with bot Lane at the moment so many Eddie carries getting to know if the laning phase really is nowhere near as scary as it once was so Jinx is chilling she's number five number four I don't know what's going on maybe in like lower Heroes maybe it's me being a little bit kind of ignorant here but a really insult well I don't think he's been gutted in recent patches but he's been Nerf like that many times in a row now and he's still broken apparently so picked in over 32 000 games he still has close to a 51 win rate and he's just chilling at number four on this countdown like I don't get it like what's going on are you guys just like picking stuff that doesn't Downstream in the early game are you guys like hand shaking Lane are you not putting any pressure on this guy this is what I mean by the way guys as well like it doesn't matter who you pick into it it's because people like in Platinum and above can't play mid lane properly that means that aurelian Soul who is super good into the mid to late game and you know even when he gets rallies right this Champion is oppressive but he's oppressive because no one does anything to it no one had a lane properly against a weaker opponent no one knows how to actually like keep Tempo and snowball from an early lead so of course castan aurelian Seoul vegar these scalers get to the mid to late game free of charge that's why his win rate is still really good but if you look in high reloads it's a lot worse than what it was so really in Soul being here I can kind of understand it but yeah if you actually don't want to see him here sign up to the website and actually learn how to play mid lane now starting off the top three wow what a toxic way bro down to the top three but it's the truth but yeah coming in at number three this is the best support guys according to the stats this is the crack now blitzcrank has been here man for so long I don't think I need to go into too much detail here but yeah he counters so much right of course that our heart engages at the moment they do well into him so if we talk about like maybe a Leona Braun with the recent Buffs to him for sure Alistair as well would be very good into the crack but most people aren't playing these Champions I also think like since last year where they buffed his rocket grabs damage at level one so it's 100 damage and also his ultimate base damage I think that yeah because it's enhance you'll want your potential It's Made for This crank because that is your identity even better right so unless they actually Nerf those stats I think Blitz will be here yeah kind of of life for ages now coming in at number two the best genre in the game this is j4 with a 52.75 win rate and over 14 of matches is gonna get enough so all you j4 players if you're playing for your father of the king you are going to cop it next patch bait like there's no way this is going to be allowed into MSI just like I said over a 14 pick rate close to a 25 ban rate to have this healthier win rate like he's gone bro next patch but maybe the same could be said guys for this next champion because this Champions bandra is 32 so he's picked in over 66 000 matches and yes this is The Rock Solid this is malford in the top Lane at 52.3 win rate like you're joking bro so the bus was W recently and of course you can actually Max your W first by the way guys especially if you're taking grasp into a melee Champion like if you know you're gonna proc your grasp a lot and auto attack and you know go down to the wire you're gonna fist fight them a lot you can actually think about National W and when you pair this with frostfire gauntlet because you'll get that slow activating off your orders now when your W's going man like it's so broken so those were the 15 most broken Champions guys of 13 points seven according to the data that we have so far don't really agree with some of them but hey that's what the stats are telling us but yeah if you guys did enjoy this video let us know by leaving a like down below I will see you in our next one thank you so much for watching this is Phoenix peace thank you ","45":"what's going on game weepers this is the jizz and in today's video we're going to be revealing the 13.5 tier list based on the changes that were released on Twitter now these aren't like the most official nodes but they are what is currently live on the PPE and these will most likely hit the rift in a few days time so we are basing these tier lists off those changes and who's performing well at the moment and who isn't performing well so make sure you stick around for the whole video to know exactly which Champion is in which tier and of course guys if you do want to master any of the Champions we mentioned in this video or in the game itself make sure you check out the game with websitegamely.com Linked In the description on comment section you guys know the drill by now if you want to stay hard stuck and just bad then you don't have to sign up you can keep watching these videos and think that they matter but let me tell you something they don't you can pick a champion like Annie right now who's super busted you can pick a champion like I don't know like Aurelia mid lane you can pick GP top who's actually getting changed you get my drift right like you might ELO inflate a little bit but you're still the same player what are you gonna do when these Champions get nerfed you're still going to be in silver you're still going to be in Gold sign up to the website watch my coaching sessions like if you don't climb divisions and tears I'll be amazed just from watching a few of them but yeah get signed up links down below now let's get into the tier list and we're going to start in the mid lane now in the mid lane itself there are a few changes in terms of like items that will be affecting a lot of Champions so first of all Sarah's Embrace is getting nerfed so not only are you losing AP from the island but you're also losing HP as well so this means that for Champions like you know Cassiopeia and Nivea rise all these Champions building Sarah's you're going to be worse off for it also Cosmic Drive is the other item getting changed and this is getting some huge Buffs so the AP is going up to 90. now even though you're not going to get any HP from the item even though it's meant to be like a Bruiser AP item kind of funny but that's a balanced team for you this is going to be unreal for Champions like Vladimir maybe Silas and this is why Vladimir is in Loki broken and Silas has gone up from Esther into most broken tip and alongside Silas we have Annie Cassio piran irelia I don't know Cyrus is getting ner so of course Cassiopeia you will feel this but she's so busted at the moment it's unreal even in Pro play right we're seeing her being blind picked because she is that good like there are a bunch of counterpets to cast but they aren't strong enough to compete with her so you can just obnoxiously blind pick her she's that op whatever Mythic you go whether it's like rower ever Frosty Andrews whatever it is and then you follow this up with aceros and then gargle stone plate just get me out you are literally The unkillable Demon King awkward and of course we still have to have Annie here nothing is really going to affect her next patch she's still an amazing Champion exactly the same as irelia even though irelia's win rate might not be as high as the others she's still in a very good position Now One champion who's receiving some really nice Buffs for 13.5 as fits so not only are you getting more Mana refund from your actual W so it's pretty much getting fully refunded now the Mana costing your e is going down finally now is this going to mean that for Fizz you can actually build rocket build or night Harvester we'll have to wait and see right maybe it is if it is I honestly think he might even be one of the most broken Champions because this has been what Fizz Mains have been wanting for so long to be able to actually go and assassin with the garden so these bus look really juicy for Fizz and that's why he's gone up the S tip now other Champions who have been affected in 13.5 we have a rally on who's moving down to a tip because your health growth and armor growth are both getting reduced and your cues burst AP ratios also getting reduced so in the mid to late game you're not going to be one shotting people as much I think these are decent notes to a really in Soul and these will mean he will not be as good so that's why he's moving down a couple of tiers now we also have GP who's gone all the way down to seater even though GP you're probably playing him in the Top Lane for the most part your passive base damage getting reduced by this much especially later on in a game is big but also in the early game you'll ease recharge timer is going to be 18 seconds flat and guess what the number of barrels you have are now displayed for all players on your HP bar so your enemy so your opponent can actually see how many barrels you have that is the biggest  in the world at mid lane because it should be anyway like harder for GP to get out of this is why he's going down a tier now also in the mid lane we have a zit and azir has his own tier in this video because he is just going to be trash I think anyway I think the changes that they're doing to him where they're giving you like pretty much no manner in the early game pretty much like the essence of the changes of these while your early game is weaker but the funny thing is and you your late game might be stronger but the funny thing is to get to the lake and you need a good early game as it needed that bully Lane phase to actually be able to play the game and even when he did your win rate was still like 45 I think it will probably be even lower now of course like in the majority of ELO's right I say this now and I might like kind of contradict what I just said but yes like the longer the game goes as it will become more powerful and yeah the majority of ELO's games do go longer right so maybe you will get access to these changes right but they just don't look good because your laning phase is going to be a lot worse because of them then we also have Pantheon guys who isn't actually moving because I've kept him in AIDS here and the reason for this is because even though your Q's cooldown is going down which is really nice even though the q's Mana cross is going down and the cast time itself you are losing base Health regeneration and you're also losing a bit of cooldown in your e now honestly this doesn't mean too much and the Q cooldown bus are nice but that's all they think they are I don't really think anything is going to change like too much for Pantheon in the mid lane yes you're still going to be a good Champion but on the whole I actually think these buses just more effective the top playing Panther would even support Lane Pantheon and the other Champions against consider here guys is the block and LeBlanc is in low-key broken because your Q is now going to deal bonus damage to minions depending on the actual level in the game you are it's also going to refund 100 of your Mana cost if you last hit that Target and also 30 of its cooldown if you last hit it as well now your ultimate and your Q so your IQ this will do exactly the same thing this is amazing for the block like the fact you could actually now you know CS minions and last hit them with your q without any real side effects is great because you're getting all that Mana back right this is really going to help not only your csing of course but also your wave clip you can use this a bit more often we might even see this you know being Max first instead of your W but whether you Max this first or second and it kind of depends on the matchup as well so you probably want to be maxing Q when you know you can never jump into the enemy Champion like a Vex for example but anyway regardless of the actual matchup there's a really nice bus for LeBlanc and that's why she's in low-key broken and in the mid lane as well guys we have Kiana and Kiana Mains at the moment they're really struggling right ever since right really knows like the damage in your passive she's kind of been trash and what you really need is maybe a bit of HP maybe a bit of Mana maybe even a reverend on your passive but what they gave you instead is Cubase damage and increased at later ranks and they give you a reduction in terms of cooldown in your e by one second is this really going to help like it makes your early game better for sure because there's base damage there's an increase there but are you going to hit hard enough no I don't think so maybe this will really change Kiana means I'd love to know what you think of these Buffs in the comment section and in the jungle as well guys like for a champion like Kiana again I just think you're much better off playing her in another role you might be able to make her work for you there are much better Champions to pick apart from that guys like that's all that's really changing the jungle again something like Silas or someone who can make use of cosmic Drive might really benefit here but for the most part everything else is really staying the same just don't play azir now now the final Champion to discuss here guys this is Zed and for Zed just like Pantheon you are staying in a tier now I know that whenever Zed gets buff people are gonna freak out but there isn't really too much reason I don't think to freak out unless you're maybe playing in like a very popular you know like kind of long game duration Halo maybe like silver or gold because Z's e-cool down is going down under three seconds of rank 5 which is kind enough now it's not just amazing for your Shadow size but also your W right because your W's cooldown will get reduced each time you use your Eep so this is really really big but the big problem with the said will be your early game because your magic resistance is going down by three your base magic resist which means if you're against Mages in the mid lane which you are probably for the most part right you're going to be so much more abusable and I actually think at the moment you know for Zed to get out of the laning phase it is your weakest point it's going to be quite hard and before I just get flamed in the comments for saying that but it is true now moving on here guys to the top plan and for the Top Lane of 13.5 there aren't really like too many changes I know the cosmic Drive changes might be really interesting for a champion like Vladimir and Silas but I'm actually keeping them in their respective series from last batch so beats of Vlad dito Visalus because the Top Lane is just too treacherous I also think this is just like my way of saying if you're gonna play these Champions play them in the mid lane it's so much easier to actually do that unless of course you have a free Lane right like if you see an awn you can just pick Vladimir if you see something like a Gnar you can pick Silas or Shane if you you know you can pixel Alex Anderson there are certain Lanes of course you can pick them but in the mid lane you're just gonna have more success I think but anyway let's look at broken so we have Darius who's staying here Jax who's staying here Jason's staying here we have a newcomer this being silent now whether you're going like Sunfire ages heart still cyan or sunflower just I don't know like Jack show sign it's actually really good thing especially in high reloads sign is actually super op at the moment the kind of recent Buster ride have given him they've really helped him out and statistically speaking across the majority of elos sign is really outperforming a lot of top planers which is why he's in broken too they'll surprise Champion's actually getting changed in 13.5 where we already talked about Gangplank right and this is why GP has gone from broken all the way down to AIDS it so again the fact that people can see how many barrels you have it's going to be on a flat 18 second cooldown and we also have nurse the grassly undying that we have to take into account as well and overall for grass it is actually going to be nerfed so if you are playing a champion like GP it's not going to be as effective on you do I actually think if you're playing gangbang in 13.5 you're really going to feel these changes big time and in a bad way now the other Champion getting nerds in the Top Lane is Yorick and unfortunately for York you're Easter the bonus School damage this is getting reduced and it's kind of unfortunate because your e is like the only skill expressive thing in your kit I guess of course like your W okay okay that's probably a lie but we all know that you know Landing your e on York is the big thing so why are they nerfing this this actually takes skill it takes you know like anticipation on the enemy Champion's movement like you should get rewarded for landing your e instead they're just nerving the actual damage your ghouls are going to be doing so that's a pretty big Nerf and this is why York is moving all the way down to b-tip now what about Champions getting buffed well we've already talked about Pantheon and this is why Pantheon is going to be in low-key broken even though you're losing a bit of Health growth regen this really shouldn't impact you too much in the Top Lane because I actually think you're going to be more oppressive than the enemy Champion so they'll just be lower HP than you pretty much all the time you'll be able to spam your cues until the point where the enemy Champion is just killable with your W or diveable so Pantheon that's why he's in low-key broken now Top Lane is the actual buff Champions first of all I want to talk about age rocks atrox is moving into A10 now the blasts don't look huge right they're only really going to affect you from level 11 onwards because that's when your ultimate ad is increasing right and also level 14 which is when you'll be putting more points in your W and then the cooldown and the slow increase which they're buffing they'll come into effect but again most games in most elos are going to go past level 14. you are going to be able to make use of these Buffs yes your laning phase might not be as strong as it was right but honestly it's still like not that bad and you're late game getting buffed I actually think like aatrox might even be low-key broken just yet be very careful of picking him into a champion like irelia for example now the three other Champions getting buffed in the Top Lane and one of these is actually going to be even better in the mid lane and I'll start with him actually this is Trend to miss your health growth going up and your attack damage growth going up in the mid lane are actually just think it's easier to make Tryndamere work because there are just less oppressive Champions than the Top Lane at the moment you can get punished super hard for playing this Champion yes you will be stronger next patch but these Buffs will really come into effect like mid to late game I think in the mid lane not many champions could bully you in the mid lane and when she do get to that mid to Lake in your sideline you're just gonna outpush anyone and you're way too scary for those of mobile champions for the most part for them to actually go near you you can easily track them down and kill them so that's why tryndham is actually staying in beta for the Top Lane now the other two Champions are AP Champions the first of these is Rumple so your ease magic resistance reduction is increasing and this is without your Danger Zone by the way from a flat 10 to 12 to 20 and the danger zone numbers are going from a flat 20 to 24 to 40 this is huge for rumble this is legit like having a free void stuff I swear like the numbers look absolutely cracked and this is why Rumble is going all the way up into low-key broken so watch out for him in 13.5 now another champion in low-key broken the final one to talk about this is Canon who is getting maybe even bigger Buffs maybe even the biggest bus in this patch so your Cube space damage is increasing at later ranks you're maxing this first to a level 9 you'll be getting an extra 20 damage on this also the AP ratio is increasing by 10 this is massive this means that when you start getting AP in your kit so when you start getting like alternator and then you get Rocket belt you will be dealing so much damage I don't care if you're against a tanky top laner you'll be shredding them also your e damage to minions anyway is increasing from 50 into 65 percent really helps with your wave clearight this is amazing for Canon I actually think he's going to be low-key broken he does very well as well into top laners at the moment who would pick quite a lot if we think about Champions like you know Jax and Fiora you can really cut them because you're stunned because you arrange your poke it's very hard for them to do anything to you and these busts I actually think are gonna make him op now moving into the jungle guys in broken tear we have Evelyn and Fiddlesticks same as last patch and then we have a j4 and then Lee sin even though j4 got Nerf last patch in terms of the actual W so the cooldown and the damage from this he's still really really broke it like the stats tell us that in every single ELO this guy's an S plus two Champion like 51 52 win rate picked and banned a lot he's got to be here and alongside him is Lee sin yes Lee sin and higher reloads if well guys you can do it yourself you can check the Star website he is actually like the number one jungler in pretty much every single region in higher reloos I understand right if you have someone in silver like you know Ben the flower pot man he's not gonna be as good as someone like Canyon playing him I understand that but we're talking about like actually maxing out the potential on these Champions at least in even if you're like half decent at him you don't have to be amazing at him to make him work that's a really big bonus because he is a very skill expressive champion and he's got to be in broken too now in SD not much is really changing even though ramus is getting nerfed I don't think these Nerfs are actually going to hit him too much and his win rate at the moment especially in lower he loses close to 54 I still think he will be very very strong indeed apart from this not much is actually really changing in the jungle guys apart from the ramus knows okay so yes okay we have Zed honestly pick him in the mid lane guys I mean maybe at a Max Zed in the jungle might be good but yeah the champion of the mode which is so bad anyway I don't think these Buffs are really going to do that much to him now as far as 80 carries go in 13.5 some super exciting changes here guys especially if you play Jinx that's why she's in broken tear you can see here your attack speed is increasing your W's Mana course is reducing your W slow is increasing and the monster damage from your ultimate is increasing from 800 to 1200. this could be like the most annoying change in the patch I swear like no one wants to play against the champion with spiders or ultimate it's super frustrating right like as a jungler someone has to block it and just too much to think about I mean it's not really but yeah I just don't really think this is a healthy change but anyway your attack speed growth increasing and I still think like Jinx at the moment even without these bus ride he's a very good Champion to pick these are going to push her over the edge she will be picked and banned mark my words now One champion who was in broken tear before guys who's moving down a couple of tears to 80 this is Kalyn because your base armor is getting reduced by one and your attack damage will base attack damage is getting reduced by two now what does this really affect well it affects your early game your laning phase right you're going to be less oppressive you're not going to be able to get to those two item spikes with let's say go Force Infinity Edge has often with a lead as well right so this is double trouble for Kayla and that's why I don't think she's going to be nearly as relevant as she is right now now we also have twitch who's getting now if your AP ratio per stack is going down by five percent doesn't really change anything for ad twitch and that's why he's still in broken tear because with the new book you know the more damage you're getting if you're a range Champion think it's amazing for twitch that's why he's still in broken tear then we have Zaya and zyrus still guys remaining and broken tears despite getting Earth to your e so your base damage per further is going down this will actually affect you and the cooldown is also increasing as well but I still think so I once you get to like novory quickplate also the bus recently so they actually just like kind of rescinded the bus or the nurse sorry they were going to give desire so to your like base attack speed and the attack speed ratio they've rescinded this so you're keeping all of that I think it's really nice and once you do get to novory I still think you'll be very powerful so that's why she's remaining in broken tip then we have Ash as well guys who's moving into Loki broken because they're buffing 80 carry Ash pretty much so you'll accuse maniculus is going down to 30 that's a 20 decrease and also the duration for your Q is going up an extra two seconds that's a 50 increase this is big now even though your w space damage is getting reduced right and your ultimate cooldown is getting increased these are really going to hit support Ash more so than 80 carriage and the Q bus I think will be really nice and feel really good for her so Ash is an 80 carry watch out for her next patch and alongside Ash and Loki broken we also have Lucy in here yes most people are still gonna probably play Losing with like an army and you run first strike and you start W or something like this but guys actually PTA Lucian with certain supports especially engaged support you still have a lot of like power here I don't think people actually realize this I'll probably expound on this in a future video so make sure you hit that subscribe button so you don't miss it now the last role guys to talk about is of course the support role for 13.5 and if you are enjoying these tier list videos make sure you let us know by leaving a like down below now the broken 10 supports for next patch Annie blitzcrank nordis and the new Yumi oh God I don't want to talk about you me for too long but guys you can direct your ultimate your abilities look as if they're going to deal more damage and just be really effective when you're on your best friend in other words the ad carry next to you I think this Champion will be picked and bad and honestly I think people are going to be calling for her to be deleted she's just that annoying to balance and play against and because she's still going to be untargetable just get me out just permanent seriously I'm calling for right now now in S2 we have Morgana Pike brokan Center the new center we have Shaco really good against engage Champions which are popular at the moment Tariq same thing same thing with Morgana as well and we have thresh because of all the recent busts new Loki broken keep in mind what I just said right about engage Champions being really like the meta at the moment Bernardo and Swine I love it when Champions push into them when they come in close right because Ronaldo's ultimate let's say your Q as well and Swain's in his ultimate you will destroy them now because of the nurse the ash guys this is why she's moving down from broken tear all the way down to 80 will still be playable so don't worry too much about it and that's literally about it guys for the supports Asha knew me yes the changes Pantheon might be getting like buffed in the Sapporo which is why it's actually gone up to beat it a bit more poke in the bot Lane you can poke them down more right so you're all ins are just deadlier there's High kill threat there but yeah apart from that just make sure you're not playing something like azir Kayla and kalista these are obviously your troll play something else and by the way can you guys remember me saying that belleva support was good like we've actually seen chovy been playing it and going on like massive win streaks and carving up games kind of the same as Renata and Swain just make sure you're picking her into engage supports or even engage team compositions amazing pick in the bot Lane so those were guys the tillers for 13.5 any questions any thoughts leave them in the comment section and until our next season 13 upload this has been it peace thank you ","46":"one of the best ways to win games and climb is actually by playing Champions that are hidden op the non-meta Champions that count to those that you face every single game not your off meta stuff non-meta that means low pick rate low ban rate but a very decent win rate and strong counterability to the popular Champions so yeah and as since hidden OB junglers and I have four of them for you today to showcase exactly why they're good what their power is and what builds you should go and if you want to steamroll that climb by making it even more effective then you can use one of my jungle courses on vacayo.gg whatever you need to climb quickly and to reach your Peak faster than anywhere else how to keep building on strong fundamentals from low ELO to Gold to platinum to Diamond each step of the way improving every aspect of your jungling and making you a more powerful total jungler along with the free jungle Improvement PDF that I provide to everybody as well as weekly tips and free video symposiums and lectures that's right not to mention we have copious success stories on the website as well as one-on-one coaching a coaching Rod Library jungler's learning Paradise okay so let's start off with one that you probably know is going to be on the list and that's going to be Lord Pantheon man thighs Thunder clapping down onto the lanes and making sure adcs are miserable the thing is his playwright is only about 0.7 percent his win rate isn't that good below Master Plus why is that well mostly because he isn't actually that easy to pull off people don't really fully understand the kit they don't use Immortal World 5 stack passive appropriately and of course they are not clearing optimally as is the way effectively the reason why he's so potent in hyilos because you can leverage a lot of early game pressure into snowballing leads and basically take over games with your macro control that being said it's also because he's a very powerful stump bot that can drool almost anybody with ease and his atomization is pretty good you see here the eclipse lethality Spike for the Mythic we're going into the Black Cleaver very juicy good item nice for melee carries like your pantheons and then of course the deaths dance but you can go more mortius if necessary you can go the spicy Pig blade of the ruined King why our W applies on hit at 100 effectiveness not only that but he also received direct Buffs in patch 13.5 two seconds after that Comet spear q cooldown that basically means your clear speed now gets amped up and as of patch 1223 13.1 he was already doing a 318 for clear now of course you're shaving off you know six to eight seconds from that optimally but at the same time you're not necessarily for clear but you can if you wanted to you can three Camp You Can level 2 cheats you can invade you can 5 Camp he has options available to him thanks to these Buffs thanks to the fact that we now have jungle pets to Aid in that AOE clear speed but the champion is just an absolute monster 1v1 PVP skirmisher holding that comet's BF Q gives you that below 20 Max HP effective pseudo execute by that I mean basically if they have less than 20 hp you're gonna be doing some more damage and yes his W scales with ap as people like to point out but it still does physical damage he has so don't build AP both full ad maximize all of your physical damage output and then use that armor penetration passive that he gets at level 6 10 20 30 from Level 6 11 16 that guy will scale with penetration you can of course go Cirilla's Grudge if you wanted to for some more armor penetration if necessary but what we're talking about here is a champion that PVP is extremely well has guaranteed lockdown ganks can rotate to things better than most jungles other than perhaps a nocturnal Carthage alt but it requires proactivity it requires an aggressive game plan it requires user or more to will appropriately it requires you to have macro and those things are not always easily come by which is why I introduced this video by you know talking about my courses because I talk about all these things so that you can use whatever Champion you want to win and that's why he has a good winner at a Master Plus because those jungles are better at doing these things now if you can maximize your Pantheon PVP mechanics and understand jungle's potency and power from those kind of passing requirements too you know rackside gaming at least get me you're aggressive right you're not afcon farming get in their face drop your cheeks on bottlene multiple times rotate when necessary and you're gonna find someone who is really the Greek king of the rivers and the jungle now the next one we're going to talk about is Jax he is definitely less viable in terms of the off meta non-meta hierarchy but he does have a place in the game you're seeing some high yellow Jacks players use him in the jungle quite effectively he can easily Dominate and carry in Laurel why can he do this well because yes you can easily look to do your red Raptors Grom level 3 gank dive that can be done you're quite potent early while in the sense that people underestimate the damage that you can do and Counter-Strike is a great ability that doesn't tilt anybody I love it dodging all incoming non-turret basic attacks reducing 25 of damage from area of effect abilities and having a 4 Target Max HP damage profile on this that's a pretty good spell because of course we didn't even mention that it stuns you now the thing about Jax is yes they changed him and shifted him around and gave him a lot of AP ratios but that's still not the best way to play him the best way to play him is still by using our passive Relentless assault in summary he basically gets a hell of a lot of bonus attack speed and guess what scales with attack speed physical damage because is every attack you do every bunk you do is gonna be hitting harder stronger faster and then the leap strike which scales with 100 bonus idea is on a basically low cooldown especially for a Mobility spell that gets empowered by W which coincidentally is also called in power either basic attack or the leap strike one of them are empowered when you press that button so while you have AP ratios on the W on that e on that ultimate the physical damage profile is just too good to pass up also it allows you to basically say look I don't want to be active early I want to scale counter jungle use opportunistic ganks although I have seen a Jacks go red Raptors Grump he goes against the bottom Lane he then ganks the mid lane he then ganks a Top Lane he then does a full sequence and goes back to base and then goes straight back to the bottom Lane again and then there's a dragon the enemy jungler who I was coaching at the time didn't know what to do about that because he just used this road Tempo and guaranteed stun Counter-Strike with a leaf strike to annihilate Lanes unsuspectingly he became a scaling monster he split pushed that opportunity and won team fights GG so if you like a more passive scaling split pushing style he can can do that if you want to basically snowball yourself like a snowballing Champion to take over skirmishes and fights Jax does it extremely well you use the spear Shoujo build just to ensure that you are the 1v9 carry and why you stack a bonus armor on your ultimate you're also stacking up buddies and kills as you annihilate their entire team next up we have poppy now poppy here plus the next choice their power really isn't only in their isolation 1v9 potential like the pantheon and the Jacks different reasons right Panther only game mid game spiking scales better than he used to but that's the ideology Jax hey look you're not that strong early but you will scale like a beautiful ugly 400-eyed beast whereas poppy while she is a really really strong hidden op jungle and I mean that very seriously but Power isn't that she just exists it's in that she also has very strategic counters you hate Silas shinshao karthus Kane grogas Echo trundle Leeson mathematically she does very well into them and I say mathematically because obviously pilot issue is the largest thing in this game and for most elos it doesn't really matter what mathematically gets counted it's just about hey look you can pilot your Champion better but if you know you have that statistical Edge there is more room for error and of course he's one of the original or the original anti-mobility Champion you want a dash she says W now what people don't know about Poppy and it's two very explicit things obviously those of us who know poppy know that there's a q flash Q mechanic we also know that the passive Oreo gives us a nice shield and everybody knows that their ultimate is the ultimate hell no button but it's the raw fact that her W while it also interrupts dashes makes people sad especially yasuo's which I think we all agree is a good thing it's that when she goes below 40 HP her passive on that W the bonus armor magic resist increases so the lower HP she goes the tank ish is going to be also when she does that first charge you that e if you go against the wall not only do you get now hard stunned there's also bonus physical damage applied and that is the important thing here she has a very unsuspecting amount of damage that just comes through from her full combo especially when she stuns you into the wall because again while the that Q does physical damage up front after one second right the area detonates and then does more damage now what people don't realize is that impact field she creates when she hits that queue yeah it slows you and in both procs the first and the second detonation eight percent Target Max HP that means there's a total of 16 of your target Max HP being dealt by that q and by the way you heard me mention Jax's leap strike having a hundred percent ad ratio yeah the total physical damage from this Q the hammershock 180 bonus ad ratio so if you can effectively hit your East stun them against the wall get both procs if the Q that's a lot of damage which is why we like to go dark Harvest it allows us to amplify the damage using things like cheap shot it allows you to be fast it allows you to eyeball Hunter and of course Solarity and water walking are de facto standards you can go other runes there are other options obviously I'm just giving you the bass line here so obviously we're gonna like sheen sheen is great for Champions like this obviously we're gonna love the Warhammer the cooldown and the Divine Sandra hybrid penetration passive the W does magic damage so amplifying that just a little bit if Max HP on your spells you have Max HP and the Divine Sandra you have scaling damage and now you go into your Deadman's and force of Nature and you're unkillable because you've got so many resistances so much movement speed your accessibility into the back line of fight so just to hit a great stun or just to disengage and po it doesn't really matter you have damage you have tankiness you have antim ability you have engage and disengage you have percentage Max HP damage and then after all of this you're saying well how do I actually jungle the champion well all you do is you take a jungle pet choices yours basically must stop us great Gus Walker hatchling is good and now you look to be active you're again not afcon farming so the trend here is these are hidden op Champions great non-meta Champions because they specifically counter certain meta Champions but they are also strong in their own right when played appropriately so 5 camps three camps four camps early gangs pressure River control understanding how to team fight knowing your damage profiling your tankiness profile understanding your abilities because again The Meta Champions and the people who don't play these don't know what you do you do they don't that's a huge advantage and Poppy is one of the absolute best of bringing unexpected damage unexpected tankiness and a crap ton of CC now while you might know those three Champions you understand them this Champion here is a new one no one really knows about him his name is skarner he kind of shows up every now and then as a special event in these kinds of videos because he always has a very low play rate but a decent win rate likewise nobody knows what he does or the fact that his Q does Max HP damage as well and basic attacks reduce the cooldown so you can just keep Auto attacking which is why we like basic attacks and attack speed apply Sheen procs and also just keep repeatedly doing Max HP damage that's not even the selling point the fact that he has a huge shield and bonus movement speed on his W that he can use which Again The Shield strength is based upon HP so you're already saying okay attack speed HP yes and then he has his e which can Mark Champions and when he hits them they then get stunned and everybody knows the Stinger which is basically the flash engage chem tank engage pulls someone to your team and then eradicate them inherently his kit has always been good at stopping things in the matter if you hate Z if you ain't Master ease you hate warwicks and low ELO his copious amount of damage that he has plus the immense amount of stuns in CC and guaranteed lockdown really can change the nature of 1v1s and obviously team fights the singular use of his ultimate forces adcs to go qss compromising the damage profile that being said he is seeing a lot more success simply going full tank here because his damage profile isn't really cutting it in the current meta at the same time one of the coolest builds that I'm seeing from him is the rush of Black Cleaver giving a shred stickiness HP and of course physical damage ratios for our spells while in this case spell with a Q Plus your jack shows to really get into teams with a dead man's you can go stone plate to really tag things up and if you wanted to be a hyper carry machine instead of going the sheen iceborn Gauntlet for tank build you of course can go Trinity Force into things like dead man's and of course the force of nature so what you're Gathering here is the champion has a copious amount of build versatility based upon exactly what you want to do with them and what ELO you might actually be in and yes if you're struggling or a team Compass basically very difficult for you to engage on using your ultimate hey then you can go your iPhone golden for stickiness your slow field and go the turbochem tank to get your full-on engage and he's probably the only champion in this game at the moment who is reliably building that item that being said you can see a champion that has a point-and-click guaranteed lockdown suppression that can drag someone into their team priority targets rip someone who has movement speed and a shield to do something about that engage and then of course someone who has a cool down refreshing Max HP physical damage spell that allows him to clear really quickly in fact there was a scar in season 9 which was ganking meta yes we were all ganking 2 minute 30 respawn timers on the cams it was hell if you want a clear Max Q you can do that in fact that would be my mostly normal recommendation but you can Max that e if you perhaps wanted to be more of a ganking jungler to amplify that slow and that damage from that spell and obviously reduce the cooldown bombing your ganking style you have your choice but a damage but a tank bit of both you have your choice he is a dynamic champion in terms of these aspects if you specifically just want to counter the matter you've got your poppies you've got your scanners they can do that they have multiple play Styles available to you and if you just want a 1v9 in a different aggressive way but the jungling style that will make the enemy jungle very confused as to what he should be doing exactly then you've got the pantheon and the Jags four very strong hidden OPI junglers when used correctly their data doesn't always reflect that because of this but should you do so there is always good data at specific ranks to Showcase they do have the power will you use it use the 10 jungling commandments on your screen now to amplify your jungling as well ","47":"the title of this video might have you wondering what we're talking about after all you see flash all the time in literally every single game so what do we mean that it's not meta there's an important distinction that we want to make here flash used to be basically compulsory you just had to take flash there wasn't another viable option every Champion every role would take it and that was the end of it it was so unquestionable that you take flash every game that there have been debates for a decade now on which key should be used for it I mean of course F stands for Flash but basically there just wasn't a ton of variety or options when it came to Summoners some notable exceptions like Shaco jungle will run ignite but in the same way that ignite onshaco is pretty much mandatory for him there's just not much variety when it comes to Summoners for a lot of Champions people have sort of agreed that there is just a best in slot option and that's usually flash we can see how this was not too dissimilar to how heel was treated as well for adcs it used to be the de facto best Summoner spell in bot Lane and it receives several Nerfs over the years before we saw things like teleport cleanse barrier and exhaust crop up more frequently however in this case these other Summoner spells were taken alongside flash it was Unthinkable that someone might not run it not using it was actually one of the easiest ways to tell that someone was trolling and disco Nunu is part of League culture that will probably never go away I mean just listen to this reaction from sneaky and doublelift when ghost and cleanse get picked in a pro game wait what the am I right [\u00a0__\u00a0] Summoners he's actually running it down for some reason flash on the Champions that it's good for has just been treated like it shouldn't ever be swapped out but that's why I'm here to make my case that you really should be thinking about doing just that way more often in High ELO it's just now starting to catch on but in low ELO you rarely ever see other Summoners today we're talking about why flash isn't The Meta anymore and why you shouldn't be scared to be flashless and you know what else you shouldn't be scared of joining our hyper Improvement platform at skillcap.com that's because it's completely risk-free as you're kept safe with rank up insurance if you don't significantly improve while actively using skill caps then you get your money back no questions asked come check us out with a link in the description below and get the rank you've always wanted alright now let's get into this guide to First understand why we might not need flash we need to understand why flash is so good and I think we can chalk this up to a few different points one flash lets you immediately reposition in an instantaneous way and two flash interacts with abilities in a way that doesn't exist without it let's break down these points further one by one the first part of point one the instantaneous part instantaneous abilities are very rare in League of Legends the fact that flash is one of them makes it unique and it does something that no other ability can replicate even Champions that have the most comparable ability to a flash Ezra's Arcane shift and caston's Rift walk don't have instantaneous blinks this is because most abilities in League have what's called a cast time whereupon pushing your button for that spell your Champion will stop moving and cast the ability before it goes off and control is once again returned to the player these cast times commonly last 0.25 0.5 or 1 second ezreals and castins both being 0.25 seconds other instantaneous abilities exist in the form of certain spells that with cast time would feel incredibly awkward syndrais Q has no cast time but as a result does have time before it actually deals damage spells just don't really exist in a truly instant way of course some other champion do not have cast time on their dashes but rather travel times instead or other restrictions gravesdash kha'zix sleep shantant Jax Q Etc these movement spells have this limitation even echo or Zed whose second half of their dashes are instantaneous are gated by the first half in fact having a travel time there's a reason why these cast times are the duration that they are and that's counter play the median human reaction time is 0.273 seconds on average most people are going to be able to see the start of even the fastest ability and have some chance of reacting to it of course if you try to react to an ability with a 0.25 second cast time or quick travel time with your own ability that also has a 0.25 second cast time you're not going to be able to react unless you have something that acts instantaneously and that's where flash is insanely valuable if an entire enemy team comp is full of things that you need to react quickly to like a malphiteled blitzcrank hook or a gragasault flash definitely provides a ton of value where a normal Dash might just get caught anyways either due to cast time travel time or a lack of distance creation in this game I purposely didn't take flash into a malphite just to see how playable it would be and well it wasn't even though I was super fat but in the case that none of these things are present flash isn't necessarily doing that much at least not because of its instantaneous value the second portion of this point has to do with repositioning and terrain scaling and some Champs are just better at that than others the stereotypical dashless ADC isn't moving around nearly as much as a Riven Kindred or Gwen with spammable dashes would to bring up counter play again something like a vague arcade can lock down those Champions with tons of dashes and make them feel like they're just as immobile as an ash you can go over or get out of terrain in many different ways jarvanold and vaguard cage both create terrain but act very differently a blink versus a dash in these situations is an important distinction blinks will get out of the cage dashes will not on top of this some dashes specifically have to be able to go over terrain to get out of a German alt some dashes just don't go over walls if you can already get out of something like a vague arcade or a driven alt you might not necessarily need flash because you already have counter play but if you don't you're probably going to want it somehow AKA take Flash the difference of going from zero to one movement spell or going from three to four is really drastic and the more movement options you have the less flash actually matters other effects like grounding from singew or Casio W can make flash lose value as it just can't be activated and that is something to consider as well but let's go on to our next point flash has a lot of cool interactions the nature of being able to instantaneously reposition means that some abilities get a lot better flash buffering is a huge one something like Annie ultimate works by placing your cursor on a location and if Annie is not in range she will walk to get into range before actually casting however if you flash instead of allowing her time to walk the alt will be cast immediately as the flash happens it's a common misnomer that we say flash ult when really what happens here is that Annie presses alt first and then flashes to get into range and this achieves the desired interaction any ability that can be cast outside of range can work like this which includes Lux e velcasi and more even abilities that don't work like this have some other interactions as well in a time that it takes you to travel during a spellcast where your aiming might need to change and Flash can add a lot of Versatility gragas e can be instantly repositioned after casting and that is probably the first thing I think of when it comes to cool interactions vikue and shenton's also has a similar effect when using Flash and other abilities like Ezreal are and casiar can be redirected or made to look like they're coming from the place that they're casted while not actually being the case this works due to cast times where your location can change during the cast of an ability but usually only through the use of Flash and something like dravin R can also redirect in a way that he normally cannot do without the most famous example of this is definitely the Lee sin ultimate commonly dubbed the insect where during the cast time of your old you can Flash to change the direction of it at least an R actually can both be flash buffered by flashing into range and also flash redirected which makes the Summoner incredibly versatile for him in particular even weirder some abilities that are uncancelable like nocturnar can be flashed out of when normally the ability is Unstoppable by any other means including interference from your opponents but honestly this one isn't really that important so how important flash is to your Champion really depends on how useful the specific interactions really are of course for Champions that have massive use out of flash it's probably a no-brainer to have it but let's talk about the Champions that don't really get the luxury of using this super well Scion Q has a long cast time to get the desirable effect of a knock-up and you can't cast flash in the middle of it to reposition it on top of this you can't flash while his R is active and that needs to channel for a certain duration in order to increase the damage and CC duration because of this Scion can't really use Flash offensively super well when it comes to surprising your opponent with instant reach all of his abilities have a long startup and generally just don't interact well with the ability for a lot of Champions without these interesting options we do see some adoption of ghosts because Hunter Gwen and Scion among a decently large player base but other Champions benefit from the same idea in a similar way and ghost really isn't taken commonly on more out of the box picks except amongst Challenger players in this Challenger game both junglers have ghost and one of the top laners as well kha'zix is not something that is commonly seen running ghost in lower elos but is really starting to be taken the majority of the time and overall seen as the better Summoner by some High ELO and pro players especially so in this game Ghost is good for kha'zix Flash will always provide defensive and offensive benefits but that doesn't mean that other Summoners don't do that as well sometimes even better than Flash flash does create distance and allows you to escape situations you normally wouldn't be able to but in the case of a long distance flash definitely doesn't win at doing this when compared to ghost over the course of ghost's 10 second duration just look at how much better it is at actually getting distance if I want to get some more faster ghost is a better Summoner than flash unless flash would be able to cut out a wall that you couldn't normally scale sometimes you don't want one relatively large burst of movement but instead smaller bursts of movement that you can control over a period of time if you want to kite a champion like Gwen singed or in this case Udyr who mostly just runs at you pretty quickly Flash doesn't actually get you out of range as they can still catch you given time even if you flash out you can't turn back into try and do damage back the second you get back into Auto attack range or spell casting range the Gap can be closed again ghost can help you maintain the same distance the entire time instead of giving you a dash which is sometimes just strictly going to be worse like in these kinds of scenarios in the case that you are a more a mobile champ dealing with someone who has a lot of dashes ghost can also allow you to actually catch up to someone where flash fails chasing the casted in this game with Ghost is much easier than using flash to chase him for example this is just a perfect Showcase of someone who is looking at the individual game and selecting the best Summoner for the situation he doesn't pick ghost on kha'zix every single game but for games where it out classes flash he has it kha'zix Graves Kindred Wukong karthus and trundle are awesome jungle Champions that don't have important interactions with flash and given that Smite is absolutely mandatory to take in Jungle you can't exactly opt to run both ghost and Flash like top laners and ABCs have done in the past however I've seen ghost ignite and exhaust all be used on these Champions to adapt for the situation which goes to show how sometimes another Summoner can definitely be considered and I do think that alternative seminars are overall stronger for a lot of picks like these given specific comps in this specific example flash would maybe have allowed a similar thing that ghost allowed me to do which was not getting hit by Zack's old and to continue kiting but there are a couple of other advantages that ghosts have over flash that make it something to be considered in a lot of games the cooldown of ghost vs Flash is a 90 second difference for a lot of junglers it can be pretty common to go into a lane use your flash to blow the laners Flash and then come back later to punish it but you also don't have your flashback before theirs they come back at the same time this isn't true of ghost if you ghost into a lane and get someone's flash you will have a 90 second window where your ghost is up and their flash isn't this imbalance of resources and frequency of use can be extremely strong and allow you to punish someone who has the quote best Summoner in the game where you wouldn't be able to with a flash of your own on top of this we should definitely bring up the idea of difficulty of execution we have all made terrible flashes that just didn't do what we wanted them to do whether it was just flashing into a wall instead of over it or putting your cursor in the wrong direction and going in the wrong direction or maybe you just hit the button accidentally at the wrong time and it messed up a combo flash is hard to use other Summoners not so much we can use ghost as a main example and you can accidentally hit it at any point and the worst thing that can happen is it goes on cooldown you can't actively make a play worse by pressing ghost where for Flash that is not true in terms of execution and mental burden ghost is much easier to use than flash just because you don't need to Target it but also because it doesn't have to be used at the exact right time it lasts for 10 seconds which is an incredibly long time and a lot of players don't know that it also extends in duration when you get a kill essentially it can provide you value over the course of an entire fight without you having to think about it while flash is very much an option you have to constantly worry about and even then maybe you just wouldn't react in time to dodge the malphite all anyways you just have way more room for error with other Summoners and league is often all about consistent and getting value out of your play if you don't place a flash perfectly and time it correctly it often provides little to no value just some food for thought in general consider taking other Summoners over flash more often if you don't have a specific interaction that you're looking for with your Champion or a specific enemy Champion's ability that you need to play around you might find yourself getting more value out of another seminar in a situation where you never would have thought to switch off a Flash before this hopefully we got your brain thinking and we'll see if more people can adopt the use of other Summoners to truly optimize their game and you want to optimize your improvement at League of Legends there's nothing better than our brand new

we'll catch you in the next one ","48":"yo yo yo what's up gang leapers it's the spooge mate and in today's video we're going to talk about the Champions that got changed in 13.5 bus on Earth and yeah what's actually happened to them like if they've got better if they've got worse so make sure you stick around for the whole video I'm going to be revealing these windows very very soon and guys if you do want to mask any of these Champions like check out the game weep website our Challenger players and coaches from around the world uploading so many videos a week for our subscribers and there are thousands of them so why not join the club there is no way you want Giga improve by watching my videos on there but yeah check it out links in the description and comment section so as far as Champions who got buffed in 13.5 the champion is actually decreased funnily enough in terms of win rate and these stats by the way guys are from every single rank okay so from like iron four all the way to rank one but aatrox apparently his win rate has actually decreased by a little bit but I really wouldn't pay too much attention to this this is really minimal the champion actually did get buffed like there are no Nerfs or adjustments where I gave him the only thing here is that the bus really come into effect from Level 14 onwards so it's really like late game oriented at that point yesterday game can be decided so it won't have too much sway on his win rate but still he is an improved champion and yet this win rate will probably turn into a positive one over the next week or so now Champion is improved by about point four percent in terms of win rate this is Samira because Ryan kind of like semi-reverted her passive Nerf from a couple of patches ago so what they've done is they've given you actually just more movement speed in the early game and this has actually seen samira's win rate increase a little bit those nurse a couple of patches go like I mentioned they completely guttered this Champion taking her from S Plus to all the way down to like B tier now she's probably around bn80 and you're probably only picking this Champion to counter certain champions in the bot Lane so something like a Draven and a Philly or something like this so yeah just keep that in mind if you're gonna pick Samira and 13.5 now in the Top Lane tournament his win rate has increased by 0.9 this has actually gone up quite a lot in high reloads so the extra Health you're gonna have in the mid to late game and also the extra attack damage you're gonna have in the mid late game is really nice right but the question is is if you can actually get to the mid to late game and survive the laning phase which is when you're actually kind of weak especially in the Top Lane against those strong early game bruisers and Fighters even tanky Champions like chogeff and sign when they get like Bramble best it's pretty difficult to run into his Trend a bit so matchups at the moment aren't that favorable for him but his win rate has improved because of the bust now moving into the plus one percenters of win rates in terms of the Champions who got buffed in their win rate the first of these is LeBlanc with her win rate going up 1.13 and former will be the changes to your Q where it's actually giving you Mana refund and cooldown refund when you last hit a minion it's just so good like it just feels so nice playing up now you have a bit more wave clear a bit more wave management right and you'll see it as a result is going up because of these busts and honestly these bus might see the bone picked a heck of a lot more in Pro play because she does so well into so many mid laners LeBlanc Mains let me know down below how the changes to your Q actually feel now staying in the mid lane Kiana's win rate is improved by 1.15 and the changes yes they did improve your early game right so as far as your Q's physical damage goes to base damage from Rank 2 onwards increase and also your ease cooldown decrease by one second so you have more opportunity it is right and you're all in your poke or they just deal more damage but I don't know if these Buffs like how significant they actually are yes I know her win rate has improved but yeah Kiana Mains as well let me know down below like if the changes are legit or not like do you need something else do you need some sort of like passive Reaver when they Nerf this do you need a bit more HP or man or something like this let me know down below now moving to the Top Lane I mean you can play Rumble in the mid lane but Rumble in the Top Lane his win rate is improved by 1.27 and funnily enough in the mid lane it's got a 1.5 reason for this is because you're e so you're Electro Harpoon the actual magic resistance shred on this on the first Harpoon hit it's gone up from 10 a flat 10 to 12 to 20 and the second Harpoon that hits 20 to a scaling 24 to 40 percent of magic resist shred that is legit like having avoid stuff this has been an unreal change for rumble and a master and above right now the champion has like a 53 win rate and is classified as S2 when this Champion gets into that s tier territory we're gonna see him a lot more in Pro Plan he's a great Flex pick as well as of course but people are still maxing their queue and then they're e second so just keep that in mind if you're going to play rumbling 13.5 now another AP Champion Fizz one of the big talking points in this patch is this wannabe Aquaman and for Fizz the fact that your W is giving you more Mana back and also your ease damage increased and the Mana cost went down this means and I have checked the stats that you can actually go rocket build on this Champion now which is just like unreal it's what Fizz Mains have been wanted for so long ever since they changed items and kind of got rid of Proto boat back in the day this is what Fizz Mains have wanted no more ludens Tempest no more lost chapter and a Mana Mythic we want to go full damage we want to go full magic penetration assassin mode that's what you can now do with rocket belt this is Win rate because of these insane changes has gone up a 1.36 percent and Fizz means I'd love to know if this is real like is rocket build the actual go-to build now let us know in the comment section now moving to the ball Lane the ad carry who got Giga buffed and 13.5 as Jinx and a win rate kind of as I predicted has gone up 1.62 and honestly I think she's gonna be be like Picton band and Broadway because she's that good maybe the only like Lane that you don't really want to play into is something like a Varys at the moment because that champion is very strong so maybe you ban Varys and you just pick Jinx and you have a free Lane like I don't think there's anything else that will really pressure you during the landing phase Caitlyn got nerved right Draven you can probably just like keep it Bay and once you get to two items you'll just outrange him and should be able to like do fine but yeah jinx's win rate has increased by a lot and one of the big reasons why is because the attack speed ratio you're getting extra a 36 increase in this for a champion who just values attack speed so highly as Jinx so Jinx honestly is probably the best 80 carry to pick but the biggest winner guys of actual 13.5 is a top player now I actually put him in the top three most OP top laners for 13.5 in our three broken Champions video for each role a couple of days ago make sure you check that out if you haven't already this being Kenneth now Canon with the extra damage in your queue right you're getting 10 extra EP ratio and the cooldown in the early game is going down as well now you're not going to get that much damage like in the first you know like six levels let's say because you're not gonna have that much like ability power in your kit right from your items but once you do get roll kippo once you do get zhonyas and whatever else you're building after that this chair pin is unreal the extra damage from that is so good even like the e-buff where they increase your ease damage to minions this means you're wave clear particularly in the early game is just better right you're not going to be called out as much shoving those minion wears so can an amazing counter pick in the Top Lane does so many things because you arrange your poke and because of your disengaged you can stun someone a out and you should be chilling and just go back to poking them with your buff cue so even though his winner at overall might be 49 he is a difficult Champion to make work in lower elosa remember this is for every single rank but it's definitely going to be higher and higher reloads when you know actually how to like kite and play this Champion effectively now as far as Nerf Champions go well not all of these God knows some of them got adjustments but yeah at the bottom of the list we have Gangplank his win rate has decreased by 2.82 poor GP now your passive go nerfed and your ease recharge time is now 18 seconds flat but maybe the biggest like Nerf I mean they kind of listed it as like a change but it is really just a straight Nerf right the fact you can actually see under GPS P bar the number of Casey has available I think it's just like so easy to play against now I think for GP means like the element of surprise you might have of your case I don't actually like think it's there anymore unless you're like in fog of war and no one's seen you people just know how many cases you have and that means how much range you have against them so they can space you a heck of a lot better knowing that you've only got one keg up or if you've got zero kegs up they can just run straight at you this is useful not only for the enemy top laner but also the enemy jungler and when you start team fighting right I just think it's a massive like kind of hit to GP and a big buff to anyone playing against him and yet his win rate is now 47 or just above now moving down to the bot Lane the support here this is Ash home win rate has dropped almost 2.6 and honestly thank God for this like this was the most obnoxious Champion I think in the game so the W damage Nerf for sure has affected her and also the ultimate cooldown increasing in the early game I'm really glad about this like I think this was just really unhealthy of course you can still probably like play Ash support but only in like specific circumstances now I think you can't just like blind pick a you know like Pro players pick and ban super annoying right like Asher Paul like you know she's meant to be an ad carry anyway yeah her win right just above 47 like GPS but I actually think that's like kind of justify now moving to the mid lane um I don't really want to talk too much about this champion because we mentioning him so much recently this being the Emperor of pigeons I'm in sharima this being azir so for azir your win rate has dropped 2.2 it's now below 43 I even called this like in our videos right looking at the changes your Mana pool in the early game is 320. right like how many combos is that like maybe a couple and if you like you know get ganked once you're gonna be um after you weq out like it's just over for you like his ears laning phase you needed a strong laning face to even like have the thought of getting to a mid to late game right which is when you might actually be able to play this champion and that still might be the case but your early game is Just absolute piss like it's just so so bad and for azir to have less than a 43 winner like seriously what on Earth is that balance team doing I feel so sorry for all you as inmates out there you have my condolences and moving to the Top Lane another champion and I guess like yeah anyone plays this year but I kind of feel sorry for as well this being York because if you land your e now your goal damage is going to be decreased because of the Nerf in 13.5 and for a skill shot which is well it should be difficult to land and against lots of Champions in the Top Lane with Mobility it is quite hard to land against especially against good players this being it I didn't really agree with this and that's why yorick's win rate has decreased by 1.7 percent kind of big right for a Nerf that doesn't look like too huge on paper but yeah the Grave Digger is less effective this patch now speaking of being less effective Caitlyn's win rate has dropped by over one and a half percent because her base damage got on Earth and also her base armaged on Earth which pretty much means that her laning phase her early game is weaker you're not going to come out of this ahead in as many matchups and yeah you guys don't have to worry about banning her anymore she's nowhere near the threat she was so yeah just chill like I said you've got other Champions like Varys Jinx is really good again you've got zai you've got zerry there are a lot of overrated carries that just outperform Caitlyn at the moment and she's innately not the strongest Champion anymore now one of those 80 carries who I just mentioned Zaya her win rate is still above 50 points three percent but it has actually dropped this patch because they're a nurse so to your blade coolers actual damage and to your blade coolers cool down right increasing by a second this means yeah you just have less pressure I guess and of course damage output DPS in that laning phase and during those fights but I don't think it's really like the biggest thing in the world you can probably still get away with blind picking her the only issue is yeah like with Jinx being good and even virus right those Lanes should be kind of annoying because of their range their poke Zia loves close range Champions right who come into her and compositions so maybe you have to pick a like purely kind of like Samira as a counter pick now wine picking probably not going to be the way to go now moving into the jungle Ram has gone Nerf to attack damage growth and also your ultimate space damage gone nerfed as well this is seen the armadillos win rate dropped by 1.33 but you can still pick him I mean across the board I mean look at the win rate here 52 and a half percent you guys are chilling don't worry now moving to the mid lane irelian Seoul your win rate has dropped over one percent now I know it says here that aurelian Souls win rate is 53.2 but honestly like remember that's mostly from Silver maybe a bit of gold okay so in those elos you can get to like 30 minutes and just one shot everyone you can get to level 16. but at high reloads his windows actually dropped quite significantly below 50 so yeah don't worry too much about this this isn't representative I don't think of the actual champion strength these stats here but as when red on the whole had shot but it's dropped a lot more in higher levels of play now moving down to the bot Lane again we have twitch right who got on Earth so the AP version of twitch and also like who cares if you're playing Attack damage carry twitch you should be building like bulk into what like maybe crackle sire or something so you shouldn't have to worry too much about this but if you're playing twitch support you can see the twitch support win rate has dropped by 1.25 honestly good like this Champion is meant to be an attack damage carry Riot games please make him this no more twitch supported super unhealthy and just yet obnoxious now moving back to the mid lane we've got two attack damage Champions first of these beings that now Zed's win rate despite being in the Nerf list here well it's gone up and that's because your Shadow slash in the late game is only on a three second cooldown three seconds which also means your living Shadow your W is on a lower cooldown as well because each time you use your e right it lowers the cooldown of your W when you have your shadow out there this has been good for Zed and his win rate has improved by 0.5 and before Zed gets banned like all the time now because of this but yeah now Pantheon is the other mid laner who got buffed and you can play him in the Top Lane maybe as a support and his winner has improved by 0.97 so close to one percent and in every single role it's improved in the Top Lane it's improved by over 1.1 percent as a support it's improved by over half a percent so Pantheon because your Q is just more potent now right because the cooldown went down the Mana cost went down also the tap wind-up time is just like quicker now so if you quickly tap your cue it's going to damage the enemy Champions quicker so it's more in real time even though your base health regen got nerfed but your attack speed got buffed might feel kind of nice I mean doesn't really change that much but yeah you're even being on a longer cooldown hasn't actually really affected him too much in terms of like decreasing his win rate because it's improved overall now the final Champion to talk about guys and if you are enjoying our season 13 content please remember to leave a like down below well done this is Yumi I don't want to talk about it in fact this is just like the most ridiculous thing ever bro like please just delete this piece of uh yeah really annoying chair but yumi's winner is improved by over 10.8 it's now over 50 this untargetable AIDS of a champion is probably the number one champion in the game I'm calling everyone watching this video to Perma Banner if you don't mind her get her out of this game and maybe we can all make League of Legends great again guys thank you so much for watching the video this has been eggs I'll see you in tomorrow's season 13 upload peace foreign ","49":"hey what's up game weepers welcome to the 13.7 patch notes rundown we're going to go through exactly what the changes are the right have released for the current patch on summoner's Rift so make sure you know what the changes are of course stick around for the whole video and guys if you want to improve in this game because you can play The Champ until we're getting Buffs in this patch you're gonna win like what one more game out of the next 50. you're still the same player bro like who cares who you play who cares what you build build a death cap on kha'zix I couldn't care less you should be able to still carry a game if you play at the highest level and you think I'm joking I'm not do you really think the difference between like a challenger Yasuo player and a diamond Yasuo player as their Mechanics for the most part they're going to be largely the same what's different is how they see the game and think about the game what they actually see on their screen it's going to be different we can teach you that on our website at gameweep.com so check out the links down below to get exclusive access to our library content which is added to daily by Challenger content creators and yeah let's get into the 13.7 patch notes now we will go through these in alphabetical order so we'll start with Alistair base arm and help increase this means your early learning phase is going to be better a little bit harder takedown in the early game for the moocow now Annie another support is getting nerfed if you're playing her in the mid lane this really isn't going to change that much because you're e or modern Shield the cooldown is increasing from round two onward so if you're maxing your e first like any support to do this is going to be worse off also the shield amount even though it's scaling off the same amount of AP it is actually decreasing in terms of the base shield from Rank 2 onwards again so if you are maxing your e first like any support players are it's not going to be as good now four is it is azir better in 13.7 well I'm actually going to leave it to the comment section here does his ear feel better guys if you played him on PVE if you're maybe in like OC or one of the more Eastern regions maybe you've got a game or two under your build already on 13.7 as if so are we maxing our W first is the base armor like actually noticeable the passive changes like really mean anything what about your cues man of course going up like is this just completely cooking your early game also the stab range going down meaning you've got less range on your conquering sand like there are a bunch of changes here are these adjustments though like kind of on the whole bus or are they nurse now moving into the jungle we have Grays your passive Critical Strike bonus has been increased and your ultimate all that is decrease early game this is good right and this means if you're building some sort of thing like maybe Shield bow into Infinity Edge something like this rather than collector afterwards against squishy teams but also your ultimate the cooldown just going down is great for any form of Grace So Grace I think will be a little bit better but it will still largely be at around the same as strength now kalista is another champion getting buffed and really like the passive buff here where it's taking less time to actually to determine who you're going to use as your oh Swan Bond it doesn't really matter like too much but what does matter is the attack damage growth increased this means that in the mid to late game and yeah as you just start to get more levels under your belt Kalisa is going to be dealing more damage I think this is a really nice buff and it will definitely see Calista being picked again probably more so in Pro play than in just like your standard solo queue but still she does very well against a lot of Champions in the bot Lane especially early on because there really isn't like that many ID carries who are strong in the early game right now so kalista I definitely think she'll have a spot on the meta especially considering how good engage supports are now Katarina another champion getting buff your passive AP ratio is increasing in your ultimate space a d ratio even though it's decreased the attack speed Aid scaling has actually increased in your ultimate so if you're building something like Nash's too it's better for you and of course your passive if you're building AP you're going to get more damage from this Katarina this is definitely a bus but how big a bus are they gonna be we'll have to wait and see in a couple of days time when we will release the stats related to these Champions their Classics actually got some Buffs in this patch even though they're classified as adjustments because your Q's isolation range the requirement to actually activate that isolation is decreasing so the enemy Champions could be closer to something next to them like a minion whatever it is it could be closer but it will still activate this gives you way more opportunities especially in team fights Ride With the Enemy teams if they do have brains the enemy plays it'll be grouped up even if they are grouped up now there's more chance of you actually picking one of them off also your ultimate buff the actually duration increasing this is huge now even though you're slow and your W might be decreased the pre-evolution and of course the post Evolution well it doesn't actually really matter that much because it's still going to slow them enough for you to do your thing and if you really care about like you know slowing people in cars it's just by survivorous gradually first item or something now at least it is another jungle getting change your base attack damage is decreasing and your base armor is decreasing which means what your early game is worse off clearing camps gonna take a little bit longer as far as your actual damage output goes your skirmishing right you'll want be warning around Scuttle crabs worse off Lee's early game is not going to be as good and hopefully he won't be picked and banned like he is appropyl at the moment Olaf is getting nerfed as well Top Lane no life guys is just the king the vi King of the top plane passive attack speed reduced early your cubes base damage decreasing matching your Q first which you're probably still gonna do worse off your passive attack speed decreasing of the game made sure early game just well beatable I think for more Champions now because when you start losing your HP it's not as scary as it once was now for ramish you are getting nerfed again because in like bronze silver and gold this Champion is completely destroying the ELO and yeah your W's armor scaling is decreasing now sejuani is also getting enough because he should pick so much at the moment in Pro play just like Lee sin and a couple of other jungles were a bad talk about so the passive damage cap against Monsters is decreasing your Q's cooldown is increasing and your ultimate cooldown is also increasing this of course affects Top Lane sejuani as well if you're playing her there so sejuani is definitely just going to be a worse version of herself in 13.7 now thresh is getting nerfed as far as his Q's cooldown refund goes because if you landed a queue you could queue again pretty much like straight away after you went in or did whatever you want to do like instantly so it was really toxic for the game and this is just like a healthy change a necessary change so well done to the balance team now Veigar is also getting nerve too guys so your AP ratio and your Q is now going to scale with level your wsap ratio is now scaling with level and both of these by the way you will get more at rank 5 or level 9 and then level 13 for your q and W respectively but it is worse in the early game meaning that are you gonna get to the mid to Laker is your team going to break before you even get to two items but your ultimate AP ratio is also going to scale with level and it will be the same amount at level 16 or rank 3. so these are just straight on their survega yes a level 9 and 13 you might be a little bit stronger but that's it are you actually going to be able to get there now are you going to have as much CS because your Q's dealing less damage these are important Nerfs now via is one of those other two jungles I just mentioned with sejuani so you'll choose based damage is decreasing even though your ad ratio is increasing here yeah just your early game is affected and that's the same for your e as well the base damage decreasing but the ad ratio is increasing so yeah in the mid to late game fire she has a bit more scaling now and the AP ratios also increase as well if you feel like going Nash's tooth of five now other jungler Wukong the final one The Monkey King base attack damage decrease W cooldown adjusted so from rank two onwards it's actually just going to be on a higher cooldown doesn't really mean too much honestly but yeah your ease bonus attack speed has decreased at every single Rank by five percent so this means less concrete stacking obviously less DPS as far as your Clear goes as well as words off so Wukong here especially with the attack damage Nerf kind of similar to Lee Sim not as powerful in the early game now one of the more interesting Buffs guys in 13.7 is to yaswood so you have a stronger passive okay your Shield but you're also getting four stacks of your sweeping blade so if you Max this first are you actually going to benefit from this like is this the way that Yasuo players are going to play this champion in 13.7 I'm super excited to see if that's how it's actually gonna go but these are definitely Buffs the  and I can't wait until he's been like 100 of games now Jerry is the final Champion here guys and foreign Health growth is decreasing your passive Shield absorption is decreasing and your ultimate ad scaling is decreasing now your health growth decreasing the ultimate scaling decreasing this will affect more your mid to late game but I think for the most part Heroes area is still going to be zerry you're still going to be zapping you're still going to be you know space gliding around the map so at least you keep like your mobility and stuff but of course these are actual big nerves I expect a winro maybe to drop like two percent because of them but yeah you will still be able to play this Champion but what about the other stuff what about like actual items getting changed in this patch well in 13.7 Dev stance is getting pretty much reverted so attack damage is going down armor is going down but you're getting 15 ability haste now for it which means that you can finally if you're playing Riven if you're playing Fiora if you're playing one of those saw playing bruises you can benefit more from this item because ability has is important for you this is a good change I don't know why they got rid of the ability heads and yeah this is really good for someone like Riven I think in particular because you're going eclipses your Mythic for the most part now that is not giving you ability Haze virus passive like gold Drinker is so if you're getting ability heads from your items you appreciate it even more huge for Riven and pretty much every other top playing bruise and maybe jungler their countless surveillance is also getting nerved here or changed maybe so the health is going up so you're getting more HP from the item but you are gonna have to spend an extra 200 gold so pretty much just the same as lost chapter now it's just like the correlation I guess if you're going Rod of Ages so 1300 gold it means you're going to really have to think about your base a little bit more are we going to see more Mages in the mid lane start sapphire crystal and refillable potion so they actually make this Catalyst surveillance 950 gold or more attainable early on I think we will I think it's like an important route to go if you're playing something like rise castiopeia these type of Champions and because of this as well this is affecting both Rod of Ages and Abyssal mask of course so the Abyssal mass is going up by 15 because of the extra 200 gold here both are Bissell mask and Rod of Ages the combined gold is going down by 200 gold because of it and the final change in 13.7 guys that you really have to be aware of is just to Grievous once so you know how in Champions like who might block spells I don't know like maybe Siva with a spell shield right well if you're gonna block something like with a shield or something like this the important thing here is that if that ability has like River swims attached to it so if you do have a Bluetooth orb or something that griever swims strong is actually going to apply to the Target now now of course if you're invulnerable those Grievous wins are still not going to hit you and actually apply to you if you try to block a river swings they will apply to you just like leandries applies to them so yeah that's like a little adjustment the Rye made to the game so those are the changes guys the actual changes we know about a 13.7 and in tomorrow's video we will probably do a tier list where we like reveal the hardcore stats for you based off 13.7 and what's been happening in the last couple of days so make sure you hit the Subscribe button for that and guys until tomorrow's video this has been a thank you so much for watching remember to leave a like down below bye thank you ","50":"we've got another huge patch in our hands with many meta Champs from 13.4 falling in power every single roll will see a shake of this patch as we are said to break down the most optimal solo carries for 13.5 but before we get into it be sure to check out skill cap if you want to truly get better at League of Legends we're the only service that offers a money-back guarantee if you don't climb at least five divisions while actively using our service we do this because our service really does work and if it doesn't work for you you shouldn't pay learn more at the end of this video or click the link in the description below Gangplank Nerfs give room for a few newcomers to step into the spotlight as Olaf will be our first Solo Carry top when it comes down to exerting early game pressure and dominating the laning phase few do it better than Olaf Olaf does extremely well in extended skirmishes as his dueling power ramps up the lower Health he's on the more room you have to run the enemy down with ghost the more kill threat you'll have so letting the enemy push into you is a good win condition you can Whittle the enemy down with q and E poke and then once they're in Lethal and step up too far you can run them down with ghosts for easy kills our new website exclusive master and minutes Wave Control course is a really good resource if you're looking to improve your Wave Control game it's very quick condensed into the point content that is easy to grasp and will instantly improve your Wave Control knowledge bandwise for Olaf Fiora is one of the more volatile Lanes as her mobility and W can be difficult to trade around there are a few viable builds for Olaf going around right now ravenous into jock show is the most popular two item core while stride breaker into death stance is also a great option it really comes down to preference here so try both out and see what you like the best conqueror is the optimal Olaf Keystone along with inspiration for secondaries running free boots and approach velocity fresh off some massive Buffs from 13.4 malphite will be moving into a top three spot for the first time this season malphite is such an incredible top laner right now because you can adapt extremely well to each matchup and hard counter a lot of the meta picks recent W Buffs give so much more power to a w Max and you should be looking to try it out in matchups where you're against a physical damage melee champ a solid win condition you can look to apply to all your games is utilizing a fog of War to maximize pick power malphite ultimate is such a disgusting team fight tool if the enemy doesn't see it coming so if you can secure Vision around objectives wait for the enemy to face check in and land a multi-man alt in a choke your job is done without question the best ban for malphite is Silas as the champ with malphite ultimate is just way too powerful core build for Mao consists of an iceborn Gauntlet rush into Sunfire second and a situational tank item third comet is the best Keystone if you're planning to go for a q Max while grasp is going to work best when you're in melee lanes and are going for the W Max maintaining a spot in the Top Lane top three for another patch is going to be Darius worth noting right off the bat is that Adorn Shield start is now performing way worse than doran's blade D Shield Nerf slash patch have led to Darius running into some issues against top laners with strong harass power like GP and Jace lucky for Darius gangblank is being nerfed in 13.5 so if you focus your band on Jace things should be smooth sailing in Lanes where the enemy lacks early poke power definitely be running doran's blade now instead of doran's Shield d-blade users are now winning a whole three percent more than D Shield users to maximize darius's potential be aggressive off the level 2 Spike if you hit it before the enemy both level 2 and level 3 are really big spikes for Darius so if the enemy disrespects you and does not back off when you have the level lead look to punish by going all in with ghost build for Darius consists of a stride breaker or Trinity Force rush into Dead Man's plate second and sterics or force of nature third Rune page is conqueror as the Keystone along with resolve for secondaries with second wind and unflinching taking Second Wind helps make up for those Nerfs Adorn Shield the best solo queue jungler for 13.5 is none other than Jarvan Jarvan does it all right now as his early game Power is amazing team fight is some of the best for any jungler and the catch range is ridiculous with EQ into flash R combo in games where you have a melee CC support look to be camping bot and getting them ahead especially after recent ADC Buffs the team who has the stronger ADC is likely to win that game so playing for bot whenever you can is vital to your success Jarvan EQ combo in combination with something like a thresh hook or Nautilus Hook is a free kill every single time bandwise for Jarvan we would recommend getting rid of a meta appeal support like Recon or thresh as they can do a good job at limiting your catch power Gore Drinker into Black Cleaver is the stapled 2 item core for Jarvan and your third purchase really depends on the game for runes roll with conqueror followed by Triumph alacrity and coup de gras magical Footwear and Cosmic Insight are the way to go for secondaries early ganks are being hit in 13.5 while farming will now become more rewarding which is absolutely incredible for a jungler-like fiddle we've already had fiddle rated as one of the best solo queue junk in previous patches and he'll become even more powerful moving forward it's not like fiddle's early ganks are the worst in the game but his level 6 power is just drastically better so more gold going into jungle camps is amazing fiddle's ultimate allows for him to pull off some of the more creative gank paths at level 6 making his bot Lane gank power insanely Strong Tower dive power is also some of the best for any jungler so looking to snowball bot Lane at level 6 is a really good win condition optimal band for fiddle right now is Jarvan the only way you lose on fiddle is if the enemy jungler is playing an early game dominant pick and they snowball super hard so with Jarvan being meta he's a no-brainer band standard build path consists of a rocket belt Russian lasagna's second in Shadow Flame or void staff third varun's First Strike has slowly but surely become the stable Keystone for fiddle and you'll grab domination for secondaries with cheap shot and ultimate Hunter another jungler we've rated quite highly in recent patches who's only going to become more optimal in 13.5 is Evelyn Eve plays very similar to fiddle in the sense that level 6 is where she thrives and reaching that as quick as possible is vital added go gold from farming camps means an even more lethal level 6 Spike for Evelyn in 13.5 since Eve can't be as proactive throughout the early game Banning out a strong meta ganking jungler like Jarvan is a good idea the build consists of a rocket belt rush into rabidon's second and void staff third electrocute is the Keystone with Sudden Impact eyeball collection and Relentless Hunter optimal secondaries include absolute focus and Gathering storm coming off recent Buffs in 13.4 and an especially strong mid laner for the lower ranks is vegar those range Buffs to q and W are super massive and help immensely to alleviate vegar's core weakness of being a shorter ranged Mage the only matchup most bigger players have been losing quite heavily to in recent patches is aurelian Seoul so now that he's nerfed in 13.5 it gets even better for vague highly mobile assassins are who vegar struggles against the most so Banning out Zed or Katarina is good value win condition for vegar is quite simple as you want to farm as many cue Stacks as possible throughout the early game to begin taking over two items onward there are two viable builds you can run on vegar if you are against a heavy melee dive con up then run everfrost for added peel power into a heavier range comp where out of Ages is amazing and synergizes very well with vegar scaling power Rune wise electrocute is the most common Keystone however first strike is being played a ton in High ELO and works very well if you're going for the rod of Ages build one mid laner heavily prioritized in the higher ranks but more slept on for lower elos is Tristana trist mid is insanely strong right now with a quick blades and bloodthirster build majority of trist players are still running phantom dancer but you don't even need the attack speed since quick blades will give you perma-up time on Q the assassination power with this build is absolutely nuts and it's almost like you don't even play trist like a normal ADC you can win Lane with trist as early as the second wave due to how powerful her level 2 all in is look to hit 2 before the enemy and if they are still level one and in your W range jump in for an easy winning trade band wise for tryst Casio is a good option and she does a good job at nullifying tris's ability to jump in aggressively when going for this 80 stack build look to run lethal tempo as the Keystone to make up for the Lost attack speed overheels also super underrated and a great pickup since it was buffed Annie being a top tier mid for multiple patches throughout all ELO's brackets was not on our bingo card for season 13 but here we are to be fair the champ does fall off a little for the higher ranks but she's an absolute monster of a pick for the lower elos and cracks the top three in 13.5 point-and-click one shot power makes Annie one of the best Champions at punishing players who face check set up around objectives before they spawn hide in fog of war and take out enemy squishies as they walk in alone longer ranged pick Champs are who Annie struggles against the most so Banning out Lux is good value in our recent Korean builds video we showcased faker's new Annie setup and if you aren't aware of it definitely give it a go Rod of Ages as the rush item followed by zanyas and ramadans is the three item core as for runes its first strike is the Keystone with perfect timing biscuits and Cosmic insight manaflow and Scorch are for secondaries Jinx has been an ADC trending upwards in recent patches and with her being buffed in 13.5 she'll be moving into the top three Samira and Zaya both falling in power recently also opens things up even more for someone like Jinx to rise above thresh buffed and coming back into meta is another reason for priority to rise on jinx as that duo is extremely deadly with hook into flame chomper's combo since Jinx has the ability to play for early kill threat Banning a support like Morgana who can nullify that is a good idea mid game team fight power is some of the best for any ADC so once you've got Kraken an infinity edge completed is when you should be looking to play for those 5v5s third item really depends on the game as hurricane phantom dancer and fire Cannon are all viable options lethal Tempo is the best Keystone with presence of Mind bloodline and coup de gras run absolute focus and Gathering storm for secondaries one of the best of users of the recent bloodthirster and overheal changes and our second Solo Carry ADC is Draven not only this but more melee supports coming back into meta is extremely good for an early game dominant ADC like Draven did level 2 jump is something you can look to play towards each game with Draven and if you manage to hit the spike before your opponents going all in if they don't respect you is a sure way to obtain an early Advantage Draven can outplay skill shot Champs quite well due to his Mobility from w but point-and-click CC Champs like not and Annie can be more difficult so either is a good band bloodthirster rush into Infinity Edge second and Kraken Slayer third is the Core built to try for 13.5 to amplify the power of bloodthirsty even further you want to run overheal in runes lethal Tempo is the Keystone to make up for the lack of attack speed from your first two core items to round out the top three for ADC is going to be twitch even though twitch is being nerfed this patch it's only AP builds being hit which won't affect his power level for ADC if you guys have not tried the twitch for Khan Duo yet and have someone you can play it with it's literally free elo and 13.5 recanding in meta is massive as twitch goes in stealth Recon ease to him while he's in viz and the enemy does not expect the engage range at all the duo literally has a 54 win rate across all ranks this catch power that twitch possesses is what sets him apart from the majority of adcs tired of waiting for your support to make plays happen twitch can do it by himself through going stealth and finding picks on squishies that are caught out of position tryst is one of the better bands for twitch as their early game on power is difficult to match core build revolves around laid the ruined King Rush krakensire second and hurricane third lethal Tempo is the Keystone while inspiration for secondaries is quite sleeper now after the treasure hunter Nerfs a couple Buffs from last patch and Senna goes from a middling support to one of the best in the game when it comes down to carry power from the support role the scaling strength of senna and her ability to not only deal damage but provide utility at the same time makes her a great pick stacking as many Souls as possible throughout the laning phase is a good win condition to play towards and with more melee supports in meta this becomes a little easier with that said melee supports with point-and-click CC can be more difficult to space around so batting Nautilus is a good idea the core build for Santa is an umbral glaive rush into an eclipse second and fire Cannon third Fleet is the Keystone Rune with presence of Mind alacrity and cut down run bone plating and Revitalize for secondaries Annie has shaken off the recent 13.4 Nerfs and remains a very powerful solo queue support for another patch you've got a very clear win condition to play for on Annie as her Skirmish power at level 6 is hard for other supports to match just the threat of Tibbers will force the enemy to play more reserves and you can use that to your advantage to acquire Lane priority if they don't respect the all in power then it's very easy for Annie to full combo and nearly one shot at level 6. the longer range catch supports are who Annie struggles most against so Lux is a good band standard two-item course shirelli is with rylies as the catch power and staking power of the combo is really insane for runes pick up Airy with manaflow Transcendence and Scorch grab Taste of blood and Relentless Hunter for secondaries very surprised to see where Khan Escape 13.5 without a single Nerf so he will continue to be an optimal support carry the instant long range catch power is something that sets rakhan apart and gives him the ability to punish positional mistakes better than any support if you like being the one to start fights and not having to rely on your team to do so Recon is the perfect support playing around fog of war and picking enemies off when they walk through choke points is key to finding success on recon look to acquire vision control on the side of the map where the next objective is spawning and use that knowledge to facilitate pick plays when the enemy team is split you really want to limit those fights where you're just running at the enemy in the open as it's much easier for them to react and Flash away a good metaband for economy right now is Annie as her point-and-click stun can shut down engage power quite heavily core build for Khan is a shurelius rush into Redemption second and wardstone third Guardian is the Keystone Rune and dip into domination for secondaries running zombie Ward and ultimate Hunter alright guys before we wrap this up let's tell you a little more about skill cat so we offer a five division rank up guarantee and think that's a pretty crazy thing to offer it's like a gym membership guaranteeing you'll get ripped your local gym would go bust if they offered that right not us we've offered this for years because our service really does work it works so well in fact that we're able to produce by far the largest catalog of Premium League guides on the internet we add over 20 videos a week with over 1600 guys curated into over 100 courses no one can compare we've also sent Challenger players into ELO hell's 714 times and Counting where they commentate how to carry live they also respond to all questions asked sign up today for as little as 6.99 a month if you are serious about improving so there you have it guys the best solo carries for every role in 13.5 thank you so much for watching good luck with your rank climbs and we'll catch you in the next one ","51":"attention Gamers the other day I was watching some random spring split LCS pro league games which should give you an idea of how bored I was when I noticed that the League of Legends team that's ironically named after a state of bliss or happiness locked in kalista support which looks like something that happens in my silver solo Q lobbies only to see that it was quite effective and actually helped carry that team to an easy dub and considering I'm desperate for something fresh to do in this stale piss pit of a game I immediately hopped in a norm to try out bouncing Brittany bot as a support myself only to see that my Varys was already trying to change the Strat and unfortunately I couldn't communicate with him because riots infallible systems do things like this uh you're amazing man thanks for the carry value almost all knowledge usual playable plate man like this is toxic Beyond repair right here like this unforgivable there's no way Ryan let me on the rift that I'm typing like this anyways I quickly learned that when you are playing this blue plasma toothpick distributor you can't cancel auto attacks and every time I would even look at a minion the wrong way my ADC would spam ping me it rarely happened and it wasn't stealing his last hits ever but the dude was clearly your typical turbo virgin rage fapping basement lurking loser who plays league is even if I tried to poke and accidentally hit a full health minion it would set off his [\u00a0__\u00a0] alarm and the first time it actually costed him a farm even though it was an honest mistake this hadlam moved over to body block my spear last second it triggered a ridiculous temper tantrum out of the dude making me wonder how this guy will ever find love while also showing the enemy team that this was a free win to which it was so attempt numero dose I didn't even make it out of champ select without someone telling me I'm not someone named carrier who I assume is the pro that started this troll Trend and this one was just as much of a nightmare as the last so even though I hit a flash set this twitch up my anus to save him he spit himself out straight back into danger and we decided as a group that I indeed am not carrier and should stop trying but watching the pro LCS stream that they taught me that the current bot Lane meta is more open than Barris from my first game's mothers who has they had Pros voting on if weird off meta supports would work so I guess you could say watching professional League of Legends taught me to troll and today I'll show two seemingly reportable support picks with weird perma-rom strategies that I found you can have great success on even if you aren't freaking carrier because they have used surprising enemies and finding new unexpected ways to get easily fed and speaking of getting fed I'd like to chat about Factor the company that has been supplying me with things to put in my mouth what you see getting on a prepared meal plan has been proven as the best way to have more success in your life according to many studies that I just made up which is why I rely on factor to save me time and money while feeding me deliciousness delivered right to my door it's convenient and flexible with what kind of meals you want for example there's categories for those of us trying to spawn muscles or trying to have violent breakups with their fat cells they also have options for keto kiddos out there or for people who love their animals and environment I just go with the Chef's Choice because I like decisions being made for me by more qualified people and then I typically throw in a few donut holes and shakes for those times I just want to munch or sip on something while simultaneously feeding other people in my games rumor has that there's over 27 meal options per week with each meal coming ready to be heated up and eaten with minutes so if you want to join me in other humans and eating food made by Factor use my link or go to go Dot factor75.com and use code poggraph Feb 50 for 50 off your first box and once you click you'll see my description will live update which will make Factor want to continue sugar daddying my content okay now the best part of this game having an accepted meta where everyone expects you to play at a specific way and flames you if you don't is that no mid laner is expecting two chains and a depressed dwarf to show up level one throwing [\u00a0__\u00a0] at them so we get first blood and then most people will say that's BM and a bit [\u00a0__\u00a0] but surely they will go back to their assigned cubicles now but that's where we immediately pay a visit to dirty D at her Rock dudes and once she's deceased since this irelia looks at her mini-map less than Riot looks at their game state of balance we finish off the hat-trick of troll roaming support starts and I'd like to think I just got three other players an advantage and with that much of a head start this would be an easy game but turns out wind [\u00a0__\u00a0] are like boxes of chocolates where you never know what kind you're gonna get the one on our team was moronic fatherless feeding [\u00a0__\u00a0] stain flavor which meant the early Advantage I got my team was removed quicker than Drake's viable jizz in a hot sauce filled condom which meant I had to roam like a plastic bag in the wind to deal with the feeders fed win twin which wasn't exactly how I wanted to spend my Saturday but what was even worse than dealing with the big mid lane Airbender is thinking were good because we just milked this goat like two lactose intolerants trying to make a grilled cheese only for dirty D to come in flashing her bank account balance from all the yone handouts as if she did any real work to deserve it while only fans models be watching this real quiet right now can't judge if I had tits I'd use them to stack 20s as well but when you are a small Gothic depressed toddler looking girl you have to resort to other means of income like heading up north to see if this bladed Betty is cool with setting up the Diamond Dance Floor for you to fortnite floss on her dead broken champ corpse then I had mid because word on the street is that their Heimerdinger didn't understand the assignment when it came to learning how to tie-dye a shirt and now the [\u00a0__\u00a0] looks like he got butt [\u00a0__\u00a0] by a gay pride flag so I give him a well-deserved 30 seconds break from all the colors before declining the towers offer to invade my anus and while I think I'm doing a decent job of mitigating the [\u00a0__\u00a0] Madness that this yone has brought into my life our Baron gets stolen like an investment around Sam bankman fried so even though we get all defend offensive and kill the Diana right after before orchestrating a single file parade which ended on one dead Josh hole Lane it still fed into the whole Gloom theme vibe that my champ was already giving off and yeah yeah I know you're all like but RAF how could you possibly be sad when you killed one of those fat tit licking Ginger pube sweat stains playing irelia and considering we also killed that Clash day Dexter's Laboratory rat right after I did have some hope their Diana might have been handed more free cash early in life than Donald Trump but she was still greedier than him as well so there was a chance until my team decided to get a hit of that failure at Baron pit Nostalgia by heading right back to it which long story short wiped us like a post [\u00a0__\u00a0] ass and with that I know that the early game roams on this Adam's Family baby wouldn't be enough I needed something even better Introducing Me becoming what I swore I'd never become the most OP of troll roaming supports I found full AP Nunu early game consisted of me repetitively rolling my [\u00a0__\u00a0] balls at the floating grape stained battery until I got his Flash and then I immediately told the group that I ate spicy wings and they always give me diarrhea so that they'd think I'd be gone for a while only to come straight back and with a large amount of spherical frozen water to get the second free flash right after this gave my perky titted ADC some pressure so that I could head mid and finish off the hat trick of forced flashes within the first three minutes of the game then straight back bot knowing that a muscular amount of mucus was in the area I waited for the skipping Play Bunny to get back and then I rolled right past the satis sack attack I've ever seen but here's the thing I know that power plant didn't have a flash so there was no chance of him not getting zambonid back to base I knew that the enemy team will have some inhumane piece of [\u00a0__\u00a0] riding her armored up pigs so I coordinate a plan with booger boy where I'm like look man you're gonna have to be comfortable getting pushed to the point of mitosis if we want this to work out and luckily he commits which lets us take a group poop on the albino gun sled as he's merging together again before chasing the baited warthog Rider down until she dies and everyone is happy with the roaming will ump up to this point even my ADC that I've abandoned is advertising her approval of what's happening I head top because I don't want big nazex thinking just because he's against a toy Renekton that this game's gonna be play time so we let him thrust us into a statue and then we kill him off at this point I've positively impacted every lane so if you were to ask me if I feel guilty about that one time the cops came and I told them I've never seen that MF in my life before piecing out and letting her deal with it the answer would be maybe but here's the thing I know these [\u00a0__\u00a0] were close and my Wi-Fi scanning confirmed that they couldn't see me until my cover was busted so I called the boys over and said we need a quick River Rendezvous 10 4 10 4 I wanna roll a snowball over a dead zerath before setting up a kill two birds with one snowball combo as I drifted this [\u00a0__\u00a0] straight into the cocaine addict from Arcane before hitting an ALT steel that was surely bound to piss her off and while I did feel a bit guilty I really like traveling and in this economy you need a lot of cash to keep doing that as I drove my 98 Chevy snow Circle straight into the realization that I should have taken ignite this game but hey at least I didn't donate my brain to science before I was done using it like this Zoe aryone is pinging me because turns out he's a toxic piece of feces which I should come to expect with people who play Win Shooters at this point but that wasn't going to stop me from whipping Tic Tacs at Mr T and then channeling the queef Quake of a century to set up boom solo Renekton only on an easy kill up top then I get a sudden urge to snow plow a tranquilizing toddler so I start rolling a bludgeon blunt in her direction as she hits me with two hops this time and drugs me in the danger zone that I just barely escaped before taking my nap me and Zachary are now looking to meet up with some loose women in the woods but there's no takers so I'm like hey why don't you slingshot your snotty body into those [\u00a0__\u00a0] and I will accommodate you to the dead [\u00a0__\u00a0] ball and assure that you don't get credit for either kill arione finds himself dumb and in danger like they all do so he gets removed from the rift which I guess warrants some pings as if I had any desire to save his species from going extinct as I then start chasing down his killer offering to steer my snowball into a wall if she drops her sleeping pills to which she does so I'm like see these Arrangements don't have to be flashy but she insists on being fidgety so I have to resort to freeze farting her I'm trying to sabotage their surveillance but they are onto me so I pull on Willy's back pubes to have him drive me over to what I just know is gonna be the windshitter in another losing battle that he's convinced he is winning so I come and Chomp the chomp and steal the kill knowing yone won't do [\u00a0__\u00a0] with that cash anyways to which he wants to surrender and when we don't there are creative ideas on how we can kill ourselves exchange with a level of Dyslexia just high enough to evade Riot's stupid band systems but I'm with MF on this one both in that yone is definitely dodged his fair share of coat hangers in the womb but also in an effort to kill this purple lava lamp but what I lack in three-point turning eye makeup with full AP burst then because MF is my bestie I'm like I'll take a bullet for you but if I'm being honest there's a clear line that I draw and when more than one person wants her denim like go ahead she's an ADC not much to lose there I'll just step out over here act like I didn't see anything if the cops asked me later I'll plead the fifth you know eat a [\u00a0__\u00a0] in one bite and then politely psych you killed my best friend and now you must pay the ultimate price of getting killed by Antarctica's winter climate anyways one more Aram style slap battle breaks out mid and I know that as long as I [\u00a0__\u00a0] pull my way into baby Barbie they won't have the damage to tickle our tits enough to have us piss off so we bullied them all back to base I do one more celeb shot on zwag in his own Fountain and I have to give credit to my homies playing professional League of Legends for this Grand idea to troll my team on support because God damn was it fun RAV out ","52":"hey hey hey what's going on game leapers welcome back mate to another fast food video actually this one is maybe less fast food than the others because we're actually looking at like real Lilo here so this is Masters Plus in Korea and these are the top 10 Champions these are the 10s plus their Champions that are absolutely destroying solo queue at the moment and we're gonna get into the runes the builds the Summoner spells skill orders everything mate we're gonna give you all the pages you need to win two more games in your next 500. yeah that's all this video is gonna do if you do actually want to improve and learn how the game works and get good at the game and learn it at a challenger level gamelap.com description comment section sign up to get exclusive access to our library content which is added to daily by Challenger players and coaches from around the world yeah just get signed up that's all you have to do mates actually improve it's that easy join thousands of your fellow Summoners let's get into the 10 Champions broken at the moment in Korean High ELO number 10 Elise at least go nerfed a few patches ago for sure she did not just in terms of herself in terms of the queues damage right and in terms of your W but also because towers are doing more damage than the early game but is this really affecting at least like what do you guys think I don't think so right because your repel means you take zero Tower damage it doesn't matter if it actually just like one shot you or does a little bit more damage that's kind of irrelevant this actually affected other diving junglers early game maybe something like a rexai ride or something maybe like a gragas maokai these kind of like quick lockdown Champions that's actually affected them more than anything now the jungle changes where they kind of like reverted the damage to enemy camps that means that yes you can punish an Elise who's just Perma ganking but the issue here and the thing they actually do need to know if is comeback experience right like if you're playing against an Elise who's level three right and you're level five because you've counted jungle damage has taken a whole like I don't know top side and she's permaganging your Bot it doesn't actually matter because all she has to do is just take like two camps and she'll be level four close to level five again because of how the comeback experience works that's why counter jungling is still well it's definitely the way to play jungle don't get me wrong and at that point like being level 5 against a level 3 close to level 4 Champion you should definitely be able to like do something and have counter play but yeah that's just the issue and you can see that at least still in high yellow was banned on over 36 percent of matches I'm pretty sure Ryder either going to Nerf the lease and they probably will because they don't understand how their game works but what they really need to know if it's just a comeback experience in the jungle this Champion won't be as good as she is and as op even in Pro playwriting 13.5 I know we're on 13.6 but it's the same as last batch right she's getting picked and banned pretty much in every game still so there's just like fundamentally something wrong with either release or just how early ganking junglers work and that's it just because comeback experience is so op you can afford to give up so much in the early game just to get it back very quickly afterwards now coming in at number nine this is Zoe with the highest win rate on this countdown guys look at this for me a 57 win rate and this is in 410 matches so far in Korean High ELO abandoned over nine percent of games as well compare this to like other regions and elos nowhere near as good as these stats right now why is Zoe so good well if we think about it Zoe in the mid lane right because of all the recent Buffs as well especially to your e so your sleepy trouble bubble you land your e on to someone they get put to sleep their magic resist goes down right so you can just shred them this means that your one short potential is actually a lot higher than what it was before and because you're such a good laner anyway like probably the best priority mid lane Champion like you'll always have priority in the first three levels which is really nice especially if you're playing with like an aggressive early game jungler I'm also surprised we don't see Zoe pick more in Pro play as well because I think she is so good and in solo queue her play style is really op as well because as soon as someone makes a mistake and you land your trouble bubble right you can just blow them up with your teammates so Zoe number nine consider playing her in the mid lane in 13.6 now the support coming into number eight is Pike and for pike at the moment you can see that he's banned in over 22 percent of matches and to have close to a 52 win rate in the hardest region in the world and close to 500 matches it goes to show how good this Champion is in the right hand and maybe that's the key there guys in the right hand if you can play this Champion well he's very very devastating in solo queue because you're like the biggest carry jungler in the game right that's why you want to be rushing something like Mobility boost and then you can take like umbral glaive dustblade because when you go in with your ultimate ride the invisibility allows you to position and then go in for More Death from belows also does very well into a lot of supports just be careful about picking him into strong melee support now moving into the jungle kind of interesting here I haven't mentioned this Champion for ages but karthus is number seven on the countdown and why is karthus suddenly like just open S Plus there in Korea well you might think you know he's gonna get counter jungle and pressured a lot well here's the thing if we think about the matter at the moment right especially in Korean High ELO lots of Champions are close range jumping onto you right especially in the bot Lane supports and stuff right if we think about the jungle as well let's think who's probably the best jungler at the moment Lee sin and there are lots of jungles who are melee Champions like VI Wukong as carthos you just run into them and you do a lot of damage to them you want these Champions to be diving into from across the map and that's what the meta kind of is right now so karthus if you can survive and get to level four you know just ball clear your camps and get to a position where you can actually Farm safely you know like oh three at that point you should be sweet just make sure guys if you are going to play carthus towards your second buff and be very carefully getting invaded throughout the game because you are very weak to getting 1v1 by their strong early game Champions so carthus is number seven The Meta is really dictating this and moving to the Top Lane hero Champion I didn't actually know too much about so if there are any Rengar top players watching this video I want you to tell me in the comments why this Champion is so good the reason I'm guessing he's so good is because well there are many like Top Lane Champions who necessarily like counter you or maybe there are I'm not sure so something like a laoi might be impossible because you can never jump into it because she just is something like a poppy is difficult Pantheon you can never really jump near it or at least on to him right because yeah he just W's and it's GG but Rengar on the top Lane the stats here say that he's doing very well and this is actually kind of similar to a lot of elos too yes in Korean High ELO over a 55 win rate that is kind of insane and you can see that with Divine Sunder and Fleet footwork the kai the sustain you have in Lane very difficult to kill but you will also deal decent damage as well I also think Rengar top because of your ultimate when you base around level six you can run out of base and just run anywhere on the map and probably get a free kill so Rengar Top Lane if anyone knows all the tech on this let us know down below now number five starting off the top five we have a champion who well it's just is a lot more popular than Rengar and has been recently this is Jax nothing is changing here guys in 13.6 and that's why he's on this countdown for another well yeah weak patch whatever you want to call it and for Jack's Xbox Champion look at the ban rate for me over 21 you've probably noticed by now lots of these Champions are banned heck of a lot guess why because they're just Giga broken I mean maybe not all of them but yeah they are broken there is no way this Champion Jacks even though he kind of got nerfed early game your late game is still insane and with Divine Sandra grass you can still go into like a lot of matchups right where you're going to be short trading instead of extended fighting I just think this Champion is a must-have if you're a top planner right now because he's so Mada so Jax is number five now staying in the top play number four on the countdown may be a champion who's a little bit better than Jax honestly I don't know if she's a little bit better let me put it this way I think she's more annoying to play against this being Fiora so close to a 20 bound rate and to have over a 51 win rate and that's with the nurse this season so two actual like passive damage right answer your Q's damage but the thing is for Euro once you do get to the mid to late game even though they did Nerf this you still deal enough damage it was still unkillable you are still the best 1v1 top laner split Pusher it is just unreal to go against and yes with grassly undying manifold abandoned Scorch is the same room page that we've all been running for so long now and you can see here some of the spell wires Flash and TP has the best win rate but you can take ghost and TP into cardi match up Social against sonar if you're against a vein something like this ghost is going to be better but yeah Fiora is number four guys unreal chap now moving to number three I talked about this Champion right I can't remember when it was maybe like a week ago and some dude in the comments legit like called me out for saying zerry was op like I don't know if you have been watching like Pro play or High ELO games this Champion is nuts these players who are playing these Champions yo getting the max juice out of them think of these Champions as like a an orange right all of that juice in that orange is getting squeezed out of these Champions if you play zaryan goldilo right maybe half of that orange is getting squeezed you're leaving so much of it if you play rammus and gold you're getting 90 of the juice out of that orange bro if you're playing against a Ramson Challenger they'll get 100 but it's only like a 10 extra right compared to that gold Ram as very does a massive difference play against this champion in high yellow you will understand how annoying she is there's so much space for zero now Champions diving onto you you're so good at kiting right also recommend here guys taking ghosts as well as flash in the right matchups if you need cleanse you need cleanse if you're into like an ash maybe I don't know like a Morgana Lane something like this right you might have to stay cleansed but yeah zarya is here and that's even with bloodline getting nerfed this is even with BT getting nerfed because you'll build and I talked about this and liked that video a week ago Shield bow into roonan's hurricane why runards another for his quick blade that's because so many champions are close range and players are going to be playing close range so you want runards I can't just do this you will know the power and yeah there is number three now staying in the bot Lane the best support we talk about Pike number two on the countdown guys is blitzcrank look at the ban rate for me 47 this is not silver this is not bronze this is Korean oh 47 that is when you know this Champion is the nuts you have to have him in your champion pool guys he championed so many champions he counted so many champions in the bot Lane thresh for example is very popular lots of enchantresses he dominates because if you land one rocket grab bang last season towards the end of it when his Q damage got buffed in the early game it's now 100 at level one right and with his Ultimate Golf Blaster as well so the base damage but the ultimate buff hasn't actually changed you're still maintaining all of that power so yeah blitzcrank has got to be on this countdown 52.8 winner and close to a thousand matches that is nutty now the number one Champion does I was actually surprised by this but I want you to kind of guess who this is going to be in Korean High ELO this is like not your typical number one Champion so Darius it's not I'll just save some Champion too it isn't Darius is not vegar it's not all I'm trying to think of some other Champions Katarina Zed the asuo it's none of them uh it's not desire okay so this Champion is in the mid lane now she has a band right I've just said she as well so think about it she has a band rate of 44 now she's picked in nine percent of games and with that okay so this isn't just under 500 matches she has a 54.43 win rate now it's not as good as Zoe's right but the fact that this Champion is bad this much puts her at number one and I was super surprised and it's a champion that got buffed recently this is LeBlanc and 4lb because your Q is now like refunding some of the Mana riding dealing more damage to minions this is super nice for your wave clear you can actually manage minion waves now now just look at this room page for me here yes it's recommending to take the 73 win rate in 15 matches but I'll just say here guys you can take minions you materialize they're into those hard kind of like early pressure Lanes so if you're into a range ship and a control Mage maybe something like an Ari right an orian or a syndra something like this or Zoe especially minion dematerializer is definitely going to be the way to go because you can control waves and actually contest the push against them right and by running Mana flow band you don't usually need biscuits for the matter you should have enough through Mana flow but yeah controlling that Mana in those matchups is key but yeah that's all I'll say in lb guys because of the recent Buffs yes that's why she's here pretty simple build as well right just magic penetration with sources looting Tempest Shadow flame she's number one it won't be the same in other reloads for sure but if you can play her well and again we can teach you how to do just that on our website so get signed up but yeah she's number one guys thank you so much for watching the video if you did enjoy it please leave a like down below and until our next season 13 upload this has been it peace thank you ","53":"you guys clicked on another video mate a video where you're not going to improve you're not gonna get better but you guys love fast food Eh this is like going to macca's bro yeah if you guys want to pick a few Champions who are really broken right now you've come to the right view I guess but yeah if you actually do want to improve and impress your parents then it's time to get subbed to the game weep website because that is where you will 100 improve like the players that I coach right in my sessions I'm actually doing like condensed highlight videos for the website where I talk you guys through the actual like applicable tips that those students will apply and they will climb Division and tears from whether they're in something like Grand Master ELO whether they're in goldilo or bronzilo even if they're new to the game you guys if you're in those elos you can do exactly the same all you have to do is just sign up to get exclusive access to that library of content and a bunch of our other Challenger players and coaches are uploading daily content so hurry up stop wasting time and get signed up links down below right the top 10 Champions okay now these are according to the Statin Master Plus and I know you guys are going to be like but why would I play these Champions well guess what Master Plus or maybe even higher than this but this largely decides what the matter is right A Champion is not matter unless they're actually good in high Evo so for example a champion like Teemo is kind of mediocre and high reload even if he might be good in something like silver or bronzeelo it's not a true of a representation as compared to Something in High ELO right so coming in at number 10 is a champion who I've gone on about recently on our videos this being zerry and you guys were like Zary is not OP are you kidding me guys like you can even check in Platinum and above right now she's an S plus two champion and guess what because people are now finally building runon's hurricane on this Champion even sometimes before then ofori quick played spy she's just super busted and that's the most important thing you guys can do building runards now I don't care if you build it after Shield though and you can do this if the enemy team is very close range but for the most part you're probably just going to be going shield bonavory into roon on tarike but it's not the build that's making ROP it's just the meta Caitlyn has got worse right there aren't that many lame bullies anymore Draven might be a bit difficult for you to play into but Lucian got Nerf because of the Nami nurse as well so in terms of the ball Lane there aren't many like scary lanes and you can get out of them and become the mid to late game base that you are designed to kind of be so you can definitely speed Zoom around the map as they're in 13.5 very very good Champion now number nine on the countdown is the second best jungle in the game right now this being Lee Sim well according to the stats anywhere in this video and I would even put Lisa in as number one his win rate you can see in master and above is 51.35 and look at his win rate with this room page for me in over 775 matches over a 54 and this is going to be your standard maroon page for the most part Lee sin is also picked in close to 20 of games and banned in close to 17 and for him to have these stats it really just goes to show how busted he is but yeah let me put it this way like most people can't actually get the max juice out of this Champion so if you do want to get the juice out of the Blind Monk if you do want to play this champion at a high level check out our videos on our website at gamelib.com now moving on to number eight on the countdown the best jungler out of every single one in the game well in master and above anyway is Rengar now specifically here we're talking about Rengar with Fleet footwork and getting a dust blade Essence Reaver as your core items also important here that you're taking Futures Market because as Rengar your Island spikes are just everything we want to accelerate them in the early game it might be a little bit annoying the farming minion waves gives you less experienced than it used to but honestly because jungle camps are giving you more expense even if you're just full clearing you'll hit Level 6 pretty quickly and you should be chilling so the power for this Champion is all there he's very difficult to kill he won shorts he deals incredible damage he just kind of like does struggle I guess against Champions like maokai who can lock him down a champion like karthus who wants people jumping onto him rek's eye the same thing you can actually stop Rengar from jumping onto you stop his leap so there are some Champions you might have to be a little bit careful of but for the most part this Champion is just head and shoulders above everybody else and if you do actually want to master this Champion again check out our website we definitely have the videos to help you do just that and moving on to number seven on the countdown is the purple void Walker thing who has a mask kind of looks like Darth Vader a little bit maybe but um yeah this is Cassidy now for Cassidy I know you got nerves right kind of Big Time Sarah's also got nerfed in 13.5 less AP less HP but who cares about that because Rod of age is into Saras is still really broken Rod of Ages there's still keeping a little of its power and the best thing about kassadin is that while he still counters he still does his job like you're picking cassin to counterpick Mages right so if you see a mage locked in all you have to do is pick Castanet the champion still does his job better than anyone else at countering those immobile squishy Mage targets you can see though that he does have some hard matchups so Champion like malzahar who can lock him down Tristana being attacked damage Talons on here as well stuff like irelia Zed will do very well as well so you do have to be careful definitely don't blind pick him but if you're going to counter picking these runes are definitely the best with conqueror you can stack this right very easily just make sure you're taking presence of mind and yes getting a rower makes you so tanky the HP the AP are now getting the Mana of course and yeah you should be chilling kassadin is surprisingly kind of number seven now number six we're not staying in the mid lane here because we're talking about Annie but as a support now if you're playing any support you are still matching your modern shield first even though they know if there's a couple of patches ago but who cares about this because it's still good movement speed is still shielding a teammate or yourself or even tibbler's ride and Tibbs is just still like kind of unkillable also Annie's threat as a support with your stun even if she's just starting a level one right with your stun it's very deadly of course when you're running flash that's also why we want to be running Cosmic inside in our room page because we want to be getting as many flash combos off as possible this makes you the biggest threat possible just make sure guys I think anywhere you're taking shirellias and then into rylights interestingly enough for your Mythic and core items rabbis will proc on Tibbers and it pretty much means like the enemy Champions just are not getting away from a team fight also really useful as well for your other abilities of course and yeah shirelli is the movement speed to Gap close to the enemy Champions remember this is still giving you AP so I'm saying you're not going to one short people with this build but you will still deal easily enough damage but this is a bit more team oriented and you can see the win rate is over 66 and almost 500 games in master plus if this is working like this in high reloads it's going to work well honestly even more so in lower elos so any support is number six now moving on to the top five the second best support got a few supports on this countdown this being rakan now rakan in recent times has received so many Buffs kind of insane and that's really the reason why he's one of the best supports in the game at the moment with a pick rate of over 17 percent a ban rate of well just above six percent it's not really too bad but yeah and over 6 000 matches in master and above to have close to a 53 win rate s plus two Champion if he's not in your champion pool I don't know what you guys are doing eh like this Champion is one of the most blind pickable supports because there really aren't many supports that do well into him something like a realm maybe because you can really lock him down and if a ever engages into a role the role's gonna be like what are you doing bro but yeah work hard because of the recent bus and because he's such a versatile support he does well at engaging and peeling I just think he's an excellent Champion to have in your pool so rakan is number five now moving to the Top Lane the second best top laner but the fourth best champion in the game according to Master Plus is Olaf with the biggest highest win rate on this video 55.18 in over 2 200 games and that is nutty with a fan rate of over 10 obviously the best top laners in the world think this guy is a threat not many things counter in unless you're playing some sort of range or cardi champion and for the most part because you're running Flash and goes to combat Summoner spells you're going to be very difficult to beat in the top plane so yeah watch out for o life guys for another patch in 13.5 and moving back down to the bot Lane here the number one support in the game kind of like rakan who's benefited from all the recent busts the balance team we've given him this is thresh and Riot finally got their wish of Thrace players Max in their Q first but they are still maxing their W second that's actually proving to have the highest win rate and higher levels of play so even though they buffed your e you can still Max this last and kind of get away with it in fact it's just better to match your dark passage after your death sentence and just like rakana I think thresh is such a versatile support he works with pretty much any AD carry as a peeler for those of mobile 80 carriers like a felios or gin for example and engaging with a champion like Samira or Caitlyn thresh is a very good Lane as well because you can fly them into a trap yeah he's just very versatile pretty much exactly like Recon thresh is number three on the countdown now number two the best ad carry even though she got nerfed in 13.5 I even kind of said that these Nerfs will set her back a little a bit but not enough this is Zaya so Caitlyn because she got nerfed jinx's Buffs have been kind of good but in high relozire look at these stats for me abandon over 30 percent of games over a 21 pick rate and they still have close to a 52 win rate these nurse really didn't do too much yes she was still matching your blade call of burst yes it's going to be less effective in this patch but does it really matter like are they significant enough the answer is no I also think just because of the meta at the moment lots of people are picking engage right because supports like Nautilus rekhan thresh blitzcrank these are the best supports so pairing these with a tire for example xyorica like I think we're gonna see this so so much in the next couple of weeks or until Zion raycon gets really like Giga Nerf but you can see lethal tempo's eye with girl Force internal Roy quickblades is just very strong indeed and I think in lower levels of play it's probably even more broken just because people will be running into you there isn't really such thing as range in lower elos so zai is the best ad carrying the second best Champion with 13.5 according to the data we have so far and Master Plus but the number one Champion guys actually wonder if you can guess who it is we mentioned the champ in a bunch of times and recent videos and yes you guys got it it's the purple hooded figure being Jax the Grand Master at Art and for Jax well even though Riot changed you he is he just needs to get nerfed I don't care I'm gonna come out inside I'm sorry a few main Jax I'm sick of seeing this champion in my games I'm sick of seeing this champion at every single game I look at he's picked and banned but yeah he's Banning close to 30 of games like he's gonna get nerfed again I'm calling it right now so in 13.5 if you are a Top Lane main if you're a Jax made abuse him while you still can you guys know I don't need to explain to you yeah just how good this Champion is if you play Top Lane if you played the game in the last like I don't know month or so you know that the hockey stick is yeah you can easily say that he's the best champion in the game so he's number one on this countdown guys thank you so much for watching this update top 10 Champions video I guess please make sure we will bring more informative videos actual like you know tips and how to play the game better in the next few days so make sure you hit that subscribe button so you don't miss any if you did enjoy the video please leave a like down below and until our next one this has been eggs the jizz that come the squirt God I've got no idea at this point but yeah I'll see you in the next video peace [Music] ","54":"oh what's up game Loop there's nine broken builds made for 13.6 and you guys are ready now these builds are kind of flying under the radar and some of them are actually going to be really op as well so we've got a nice mixture here mate and the reason there are nine and not ten is just because I couldn't actually find 10 builds or like maybe 10 builds or another build that's like new like these ones are so make sure you stick around guys for the whole video to know exactly what these builds are but just before we do get into the video one thing you guys have to do before you get into your next game is to download the poor Professor app Linked In the description because it allows you to quickly import the best room page you use from the best players in the world on the champion you're picking you don't have to make the room page just one click of a bun and bang you're ready to go but that's not all because the app also allows you to scale your opponent and the app will give you their stats how well they play their Champion so you can know more about your opponent than they know about themselves and the app also gives you an in-game overlay so you can compare your Cs and your kill participation to your rank or even Challenger players like Faker and there's a reason where three million people have downloaded this free application guys it's because it works so get around it in season 13 those links are in the description now first of all we're going to talk about Comet Zed and yes you guys heard me correctly you are running comet on Zed in the mid lane this is not jungle this is mid lane Zed with Comet the reason this is so good is because the post you have with common and Scorch and remember back last season Scorch got buffered so the take damage which is really nice for Zed during the laning phase and believe it or not lots of people think are Zed's a melee Champion but what you really are is a melee spellcaster very rarely are you going to be like going toe-to-toe with the Enemy champion in a fist fight unless you're running conqueror or something they stuff up they use a big cooldown and you can jump on them for sure but most of the time you're playing a range waiting for your spells poking them with cues once you get your three basic abilities your qw and E you're playing the lane from afar and poking them from a distance comet is just perfect for Zed and you can see that in master Above This is where these stats are from in over 100 matches to have a 55 win rate that is legit the reason zedbus as well help of course so you're ebing on a three second cooldown to level 13 now this is huge as well so yeah consider doing this guys if you are said Main and if you have actually tried this let me know in the comments section what you thought of it and how has she feel now moving on we have a champion in the Top Lane who is just going to be Giga broken and 13.6 and already is this is vain in the top plane and that's pretty much it guys like I don't care what you build build a death cab go comment on vain seriously no probably don't go lethal Templar but hopefully you get my drift here right like this Champion with the bus in 13.6 it's just an um it's just like the most uncountable unplayable against champion in the Top Lane she counters pretty much every single Champion up there and because the bus especially to your passive like getting that much movement speed extra like 50 extra it's just way too big right and obnoxious her band rate has already gone up in the Top Lane and I think she's gonna be the big Kryptonite for pretty much every single Top Lane made so watch out for vain guys in 13.6 now staying in the Top Lane here we have a couple more setups the first one I want to talk about is Gore Drinker Jace now I have actually mentioned this in previous broken builds videos right all Drinker Jace is just amazing because well it's just really good into melee Champions running team composition it also gives you a good amount of ability AIDS which is really important for jazz and once you do get and then something like super order's Grudge you can get Black Cleaver into tankier compositions you can even alter something like more malmodius if you really want it because remember you're still getting a billy house from gold Drinker and therefore more in a way because of the Mythic passive it's just a really versatile setup you might feel a little bit of damage like kind of lacking because you don't have The lethality you're gonna get from Eclipse but if you're into those close range compositions gold Drinker it's just amazing Jace is still a very powerful Champion so go drink a Jace think about trying this in your games against those melee Champions and compositions you're going to play against now the other build I want to talk about in the Top Lane is a Canon setup now if you're playing Canon you're probably going what like rocket belt you might even think that he's on here because you can go somehow like Nash's too not the case I mean maybe you could try Nash's tooth on Canon but the actual build here guys is going to monic Embrace and then getting a hard Steel on Canon now heart still is just like a really really good item and then when you pair this with demonic because you're getting so much HP from art still the asicana goes passive from demonic embrace it's gonna poke even more you don't really need like that much damage on Canon to do your duty anymore because your a b scalings your base damages went upright in 13.5 13.6 nothing has changed for Cannon nothing has been nerfed so it damage is all still there and because that went up remember you're still getting a good amount of AP from even buying hard still because of that as a kind of gets passive I just mentioned so you can actually afford to go tank while not giving up that much AP we're seeing this in High ELO games at the moment and it's a really good setup on Canon definitely give this a shot in your game's guides now Khan is staying in the Top Lane a little bit I'm going to talk about a setup for two champions in particular which is really making them op so this is going eclipse and then blade of the Rune King well one of them is pretty popular this is zinzao and it's really the main buildings Intel you can see that in Platinum and above this build really works The lethality and because of the actual passive from eclipse this got buffed in terms of the cooldown going down right it's really useful and then by going blade of the room King your DPS is like off chopped it's like the highest set of any champion on the rift so give this a shot on zins out now the setup with eclipse and play the Rune King is also really good on Pantheon kind of weird because attack speed on Pantheon you shouldn't care too much about it but bork is actually really good after it Clips on it exactly as same reason for zinsel the DPS you have and I'd really recommend doing this guys if you're playing top playing Pantheon because the HP shred you get from bulk well you're playing against lots of Champions in the Top Lane with HP right in the mid lane honestly you're better off probably going like something full damage maybe maybe like Blackley per second after Eclipse right I mean Black Cleaver isn't like straight damage but it's not play the Rune King right like your mid lane match up they're not going to be building HP unless it is something like a malphite or something weird but in the Top Lane there are a lot of hit points so ball comp Pantheon after eclipse is also a really underrated setup and remember in the Top Lane eclipse is so good because of the armor penetration passive you're getting wrong this so Eclipse ball for zinzel and Pantheon there might even be some other Champions out there who can go this if there are any let me know in the comment section now heading into the jungle Guys One champion who's going to be Giga op because the Nash's tooth is Echo and I mentioned this and I tell this video right the most broken Champions Echo is going to be right at the top rocket build into a Nash's tooth I think this will be the best option you could always think of rushing nashes but rocket boat is such a good early game item on Echo because well I mean it just gives you Mobility extra Mobility it really helps your damage Spike as well and then you can forward to get Nash's after this because you already have enough damage from rocket belt you won't actually hit that hard until you complete Nash's so it is like yeah 3200 gold away so get Royal Cabela and then get an ashes too afterwards now moving into the mid lane here we have a champion who can also make use of Nash's tooth and it's kind of a weird one because Nash's tooth mid lane is like how many are there well you might be thinking of Diana but Diana in the mid lane like Nash's tooth isn't that useful because you want it in the jungle right to clear camps the attack speed so what I'm really talking about here is an attack speed AP Champion is being Varys which does sound really weird don't get me wrong but you can even do this in the bot Lane and these stats here I've actually pulled as A.D carry Varys and platinum and above and if you look at this Halo blades page when you actually go riff make or embarrass over a 54 win rate and platinum and above this is real and by going ultimate Hunter they'll cooldown on your chain of corruption is going down and because of 13.6 as Nash's tooth where you're getting 15 ability A's now from the item that'll be even lower I think this is going to be a really underrated setup and we can see that it's actually outperforming going lethal Tempo Shield by virus according to the stats so Nash's tooth another variation here just AP virus whether you want to play them in the mid lane or in the bottom line bottling is probably a little bit more safe because in the mid lane you do have some bad matchups there are more assassins there right so do be careful of that but yeah AP virus I think there's a super fun way to play League of Legends and it's even better because Nash has got but now moving down to the support role guys there are two builds here I'm gonna mention and you guys should count yourself lucky I don't really mention that many support builds but yeah we've got two of them for today's video now the first one is a Recon build now lots of you who are playing rakana are going more Mythic shirelli's battle song right well I'm here to tell you that it's actually not the best Mythic going radiant virtue is the best Mythic look at these stats for me Martian above 18 games 94 win rate then if we go to Challenger and this is across the world by the way only eight matches but a hundred percent win rate now this isn't Challenger not every enemy team these rakan players are playing against are trolling right most of these games are going to be real games and the fact that radiant virtue rakan has close to 100 win rate and over like 20 close to 30 Games is just massive like this is actual real yes the sample space is not like a thousand or five thousand games is just super op by going Redemption second and then this Ward Stone thing third this is just the best setup for this champion and because of all the recent Buffs to Recon I think he's a super versatile support as well you should definitely have him in your champion pool if you're a support player in the meta right now now the final support guys and Champion to talk about in this video and if you are enjoying our recent content please make sure to leave a like down below and yeah the final Champion to talk about is Annie as a support right and a bit like Carnival Khan well this build I think is just more well known and it's super op right so Annie it's quite simple you're going Australia's into rallo's crystal scepter because rylers is going to work with Tibbers it's really like the key Point here it's so frustrating to play against and it's so op like legit no one is going to escape from it any support with Rolo's crystal scepter and when you have the movement speed from shirellias as well if you think about that and you activate it with the Tibbers and you've got Riley slime on top of that no one is escaping it's kind of funny like watching them trying to escape that was a bit sadistic but yeah any support guys with this is just super broken it's kind of a well-known build as well I understand that so don't blame me for that but I just thought I'd put in this video because it is one of the strongest builds kind of like Echo with Nash's tooth or something like you know Eclipse box into which I kind of known already yeah just to really put them out there so guys thank you so much for watching the video again if you did enjoy it please leave a like down below any questions any thoughts in the comment section remember to subscribe to the channel so you don't miss our future season 13 videos this has been eggs peace ","55":"welcome back everyone to a brand new edition of the best solo carries this time for patch 13.6 as always we'll be breaking down three champions for every single role that have a ton of strength for the current meta but before we get into it be sure to check out skill cap if you want to truly get better at League of Legends we're the only service that offers a money back guarantee if you don't climb at least five divisions while actively using our service we do this because our service really does work and if it doesn't work for you you shouldn't pay learn more at the end of this video or click the link in the description below suddenly one of the strongest Top Lane carries due to recent Buffs is Pantheon panth is currently one of the few top laners who can hold his own against the majority of meta Fighters Jax Riven Darius Jace Gangplank and aatrox are all being picked at very high rates and Pantheon has a positive win rate against every single one the only meta matchup Pantheon loses to is malphite so it's simple enough to just ban him out win condition for Pantheon is to play around short trades when e is available if you can do this you'll end up chunking the enemy quite low and eventually to the point where you can just all in them with W if they move up too far the only window many champs have to punish you is when your e is down so as long as you respect the cooldown winning Lane should not be too difficult being able to transition an early lead across the map is key with Pantheon since his scaling power is rather sub-optimal once you hit Level 6 shoving out waves and dipping into fog of War looking for old plays mid lane will provide so much pressure for your team core build for Pantheon is an eclipse rush into Black Cleaver second and Spear of shojin third conqueror is the Keystone with presence of Mind tenacity and Last Stand grab conditioning and overgrowth for secondaries if you want some super easy ELO up in the Top Lane right now nobody comes close to malphite Mal absolutely destroys meta ad fighter top laners and only runs into issues against a few AP Champs moord and Silas are two matchups you want to avoid and banning out Silas is pretty much a shoe-in every time you pick Mao just like Pantheon though malphite runs laps around picks like Jace Jax Riven Fiora and Gangplank you all know we have been huge Advocates of the wmax on malphite ever since it was buffed as it does does an amazing job countering those A.D Fighters even harder thanks to malphite's Ultimate he has a very easy time isolating a priority carry and making sure they do nothing in a team fight with malphite e providing the attack speed slow Mao is one of the best top laners at countering a Fed ADC standard build for malphite is an iceborn Gauntlet rush into Sunfire each second and a situational tank item Third Run grasp as the Keystone when you are planning to go W Max against those Bruiser top laners whereas if you were in a ranged matchup where you won't be able to Auto attack very much Comet with a Q Max is the way to go when it comes down to that hard carry fighter Top Lane pick no one is on the same level as Olaf jab is super disgusting right now with a ravenous Hydra and jock show core as the build offers the perfect mix of damage and tankiness unlike malphite Olaf actually thrives against many of the AP Bruiser top laners as he's absolutely smashing the mordekaiser match up right now Fiora with her High mobility and scaling power is one of the tougher matchups for Olaf so she's a good band to consider so much of Olas power comes from his ability to mow the enemy down with ghost the longer the lane you have have to work with the stronger your all in potential becomes so letting the enemy push into you is often how you're going to find solo kill opportunities the easiest if the enemy is near your Tower you have ghosts available hit them with a Q and your jungler is coming for a gank there is really no way for the enemy to escape core build for Olaf is ravenous rush into jock show second and a death stance or ma third conqueror is Olaf's best Keystone Rune followed by Triumph alacrity and Last Stand run with biscuits and approach velocity for secondaries moving on to Jungle top three we have a couple changes from last patch with Echo making his way onto the list and azure's tooth is being buffed for 13.6 as you'll now gain 15 ability haste in exchange for the item costing 200 more gold 15 haste has a gold value of 400 so nashers will become more gold efficient haste and movement speed were the two stats lichbane had over nashers so now that it's only movement speed we expect nashers to be outclassing glitchbane moving forward nashers even had a slightly higher win rate than lichbane 13.5 so that Gap should become even larger now matchup wise for Echo Kindred is always a solid band as her ultimate and kiting power are quite annoying to play around flanks from fog of War are your best friend with Echo as his W stun when the enemy doesn't see it coming can single-handedly win you games if you're not stealing an objective every game with Echo your team is either super far ahead or you're probably playing him wrong Echo e into passive proc and smite can deal well over 2K damage when you have two items so there's always a way back into the game with Echo optimal core build is a rocket felt rush into Nasher second and ramadan's third for runes run First Strike as the Keystone with free boots Futures market and Cosmic Insight eyeball collection and treasure hunter are for secondaries the best carry jungler for yet another patch is going to be Jarvan ever since the direct Buffs combined with Black Cleaver gaining power Jarvan has been dominating The Meta early game gank power is really where Jarvan can shine and in the current state of League where having the winning bot Lane is so important Jarvan has incredible impact an easy win condition to play for each game on Jarvan is to focus the lane with the best setup with many melee supports coming back in a meta like thresh and Nautilus ganking for them is so easy because you've got so much chain CC power when you're ganking with Jarvan if you can easily walk right up to the enemy hold your EQ combo until they flash or use their Dash if you can get behind the enemy slow them with W Auto attack away and then use your EQ combo it's going to help you secure way more kills Wukong is one of the better meta bands for Jarvan as his armor stacking passive and Mobility from W makes it difficult for you to beat in skirmishes most players are rushing Gore Drinker every game on Jarvan but eclipse is an option as well if the enemy team is full squishy Black Cleaver is almost always the best second item followed by a situational defensive item third Rune page is conqueror with inspiration for secondaries running free boots and Cosmic Insight another really strong Black Cleaver abuser who's one of the best and easiest junglers to climb with right now is Wukong there was a while there where the jungle meta was being dominated by AP demonic Embrace users so Wukong struggled a lot more wukong's passive provides him bonus armor when fighting so now that the jungle meta is more ad heavy with the likes of Jarvan and leasing coming back Wukong has become a much more consistent pick Wukong can do a little bit of everything and as his gank power solid Skirmish at level 6 is amazing with ultimate and he's got some of the best flank power for any jungler due to his stealth from W in the mid game you want to play Wukong in a similar way to Echo flanks from fog of War are your best friends to take out the enemy squishies when they are split off from their Team Matchup wise for Wukong Banning out an AP jungler like Zach or Evelyn are solid choices the build consists of a divinence under a rush into Black Cleaver second in death stance or ma third as for the Rune page it's conqueror with Triumph alacrity and Last Stand followed by free boots and Cosmic insight for secondaries a new addition to the mid lane top three of this patch is going to be Rumble recent buff from 13.5 provide Rumble with an even deadlier mid-game Spike champ steamrolls over many of the more annoying mid laners like Silas Yasuo and Zed longer ranged Mages with strong Zone controller who Rumble struggles against the most so vegar is a solid ban option it's so easy for rumble to acquire early Lane priority due to his shoving power with q and you need to be taking advantage of that with good early game junglers like Jarvan and Lee back in meta Rumble can do a really good job at backing up their invade plays or roaming with them to set up kills in other lanes Rumble R is such a powerful gank tool at level 6 so you can impact your side Lanes extremely well build for rumble is a night Harvester or rocket belt rush into Shadow flame second and zanya's third take comment as the Keystone along with strong laning runes like Scorch and Bone plating to bolster early game strength Annie is once again on top of the mid lane meta for 13.6 without a doubt Annie is the most reliable and consistent mid lane carry you can play she may not be the most flashy Champion with crazy combos or 1v9 outplay power but that's exactly what makes her so reliable Point click stun does an amazing job at shutting down many of the melee mid laners we see in solo queue Annie currently has over a 54 win rate against Yasuo nione Champs they can pick off Annie from range or who she struggles against the most and with fizz recently buffed he's a good band option patience is a virtue with Annie as setting up in the fog of War around objectives and waiting for the enemy squishy to walk into you is a sure way of securing easy wins you can opt for the pure Magic Pen build with Annie consisting of ludens and Shadow flame went against a full squishy comp when playing into more Bruiser Champions who you won't be able to one shot going Rod of Ages for stronger drawn out fight power is great run electrocute for the Keystone when going to luton's build however if you're planning to go Rod of Ages then First Strike pairs very well one mid laner being significantly buff for 13.6 and making his way into the top three is Talon Talon's early game Power is seeing a boost with his base Mana going up W Mana cost going down and passive damage being increased as a champion who makes his mark from winning Lane and snowballing through roam plays these Buffs are exactly what Talon wants Silas is one meta Champion that most Talent players struggle with so he's a solid ban option Talon can look to strike as early as level 2 so playing around that is key if you can hit that level 2 before the enemy and they do not back off you should have the lane one right then and there after winning Lane if you can shove waves and constantly be dipping into the fog of war the pressure you can apply will have the enemy team Perma sweating standard two item core for Talon consists of prowler's claw and ghostblade both items enable Talon extremely well as the mobility to catch out squishy targets is massive although electrocute is the most popular Keystone and rightfully so phase Rush is actually what's winning the most in solo queue with Talon it's very easy to get into the fight with Q prowler's active and ultimate but getting out can be a bit of an issue this is where phase rush comes in and works really well to allow Talon to dive in one shot is Target and Escape without a scratch many adcs are seeing their power chopped in 13.6 with item and Rune changes but one shampoo will remain extremely powerful is jinx lethal Tempo and bloodline Nerfs are the only ones that will negatively affect jinx as she doesn't rely on quick blades or bloodthirster that being said the majority of the adcs have been running lethal Tempo so the relative power of those Champs won't change a whole lot it's more so that the power of the role will become weaker but Jinx will continue to be the most optimal carry matchup wise for Jinx using your ban on an ADC like Tristana with strong pre-6 all in power is a good idea Jinx can match burst power on level 6 but she can be exploited a little more often before that Kraken and infinity edge completion with the AOE power of fish bones is when you can really really come online with Jinx for the Rune Pages lethal Tempo with presence of Mind bloodline and coup de gras absolute focus and Gathering storm are for secondaries one ADC who can go without being affected by any of the 13.6 Nerfs is Tristana so many marksmen don't have that perfect alternative to lethal Tempo but with Tristana she swaps to Halo blades without losing any power although quick blades and bloodthirster were really nice options for Tris Infinity Edge and phantom dancer are completely viable too so item Nerfs don't really matter for Tris trist is some of the strongest all in power for any ADC so using your band on a support who can nullify that strength like Lulu or rakan is a good idea with thresh Recon and Nautilus all having over 10 play rates The Meta synergies with tryst are really good thresh hook into Tris w at level 2 is a guaranteed kill every single time that level 2 spike is something you can play towards each game and it's an easy way to take control of the lane right from the get-go core build for Tristana is a crack in rush into Infinity Edge second and phantom dancer Third Run Halo blades for the Keystone Rune with Taste of blood eyeball collection and treasure hunter Triumph and alacrity are for secondaries to round out the top three for ADC is another champion who will be minimally affected by the item and Rune Nerfs and that champ is Twitch press the attack is actually run a ton over in Korean High ELO and has an even better win rate than lethal Tempo so look to try it out this patch twitch thrives when he's able to pop out of stealth and mow down squishies so a good band when playing him is Zaya due to her ultimate negating that pick power support meta is amazing for twitch right now as Yumi rakan and Lulu are all being picked at high rates Recon twitch is probably the most disgusting yet underplayed Duo for solo queue utilizing twitch stealth to its full potential is how you'll see the most success on the champ being patient is very key with twitch as waiting for an enemy squishy to walk up too far and then stealthing in to pick them off can give your team massive advantages in the mid to late game build for twitch is a blade of the ruined King rush into Kraken Slayer second and hurricane Third Run press the attack as the Keystone with Triumph alacrity and coup de gras magical Footwear and biscuits are for secondaries recent Buffs to thresh have put him in an amazing spot for solo queue and he kicks off the top three first report interesting to note is that the thresh player is going Q Max first into W Max second are winning about three percent more than those maxing e seconds this has actually been the case for quite a while now so if you're someone who's always gone e second look to try out W the recent buff to thresh Q cooldown dropping from 11 to 9 seconds at Max rank makes it almost feel like you're playing Earth if you're unaware thresh Q cooldown is actually reduced by three seconds whenever he lands it so the constant Q spam and skirmishes can be absolutely nuts now being a Hook support thresh thrives when he's able to control Side Lane brush and apply pressure with the threat of a hook from fog of War at the very least forcing the enemy to war the sideline brush so they don't have one for river is something you should be trying to play for every game Recon being as good as he is right now and easily able to evade thresh's all in power is a really good band core build revolves around a locket or shirelli's rush into Zeke's second and wardstone third glacial is the Keystone Rune with hex flash biscuits and Cosmic Insight grab bone plating and unflinching for secondaries if you can play a good Recon there's really nobody better when it comes down to climbing from the support role solo queue is more often than not all about whichever team finds a pick first someone gets caught out it leads to the other team securing objectives and everything snowballs from there reconnaiss without a doubt one of the strongest pig supports in the game due to his long-range engage power of w Flash and R there's very little counter play to a Recon flashing in with r and following with his knock-up from W the one thing that can counter Recons engage is point-click CC so with Annie being in a really strong spot she's a good band build wise for a con it's Australia's rush into Redemption second and wardstone third Guardian is the Keystone Rune with font of Life bone plating and unflinching zombie Ward and ultimate Hunter are the way to go for secondaries this Champion is so broken right now that she's been on the Solo Carry list for two different roles for multiple patches now and that champ is Annie Annie's support is honestly even better than mid lane Annie as the kill power at level 6 especially on Australia's completion is difficult for any support to match pair Annie up with Jinx who's the most played ADC and all Jinx has to do is press R when Annie uses her full combo to finish the Target off playing a support like Annie who relies a lot less on her ADC to be extremely confident Works amazing for solo queue those pesky hook supports who can pick you off from range or who Annie struggles against the most so Nautilus or Blitz are good ban options build for Annie is a shirelli is Russian to realize second and wardstone third run with Aries the Keystone Rune followed by manaflow Transcendence and Scorch optimal secondaries are biscuits and Cosmic Insight alright guys before we wrap this up let's tell you a little more about skill cap so we offer a five division rank up guarantee and think that's a pretty crazy thing to offer it's like a gym membership guaranteeing you'll get ripped your local gym would go bust if they offered that right not us we've offered this for years because our service really does work it works so well in fact that we were able to produce by far the largest catalog of Premium League guides on the internet we add over 20 videos a week with over 1600 guides curated into over 100 courses no one can compare we've also sent Challenger players into ELO hell's 714 times and Counting where they commentate how to carry live they also respond to all questions asked sign up today for as little as 6.99 a month if you are serious about improving so there you have it guys the best solo carries for every single role heading into patch 13.6 thanks so much for watching good luck on the rift and we'll see in the next one ","56":"what's going on game leapers it's the come and in today's video we're going to be talking about 15 Champion so we're going to be low-key broken and 13.6 most of these Champions honestly are just going to be able to abuse the new Nash's tooth so if you enjoy attack speed and yeah getting a bit more ability has on the item then this is really the video for you but of course we'll talk about other Champions who are doing while I'm flying under the radar that you should probably consider playing in 13.6 and even for the rest of 13.5 as well for this video guys yeah this is fast food still this is a quarter pounder this is a Big Mac this is not something you know like a three-course meal so if you really do want to improve if you really want to get that nice healthy meal into you make sure I don't know what I'm talking about by the way but check out the gameweave website in the description comment section to actually improve this game if you guys play one of these Champions with Masters 2 for example do you really think it's going to help you improve for the game no you're still the same player you're just playing a different Champion with maybe a buffed item that's the only thing that's changing here not you yourself so if you actually do want to get that challenge of knowledge and become a challenger player permanently it doesn't matter what happens to the meta then yeah check out the website links down below and let's get into the 15 Champion so we're going to be Loki broken for 13.6 and we're going to start in the Top Lane and we have five Champions now first of all we have Gwen now Gwen might not benefit that much from Nash's tooth as other Champions so a champion like Echo for example right who would really appreciate the ability Heist but that's still the case for Gwen just yeah maybe not as much right you're still going to enjoy the ability hates and I think when at the moment is a really good counter pick in the Top Lane to a lot of Champions you're gonna see especially Tanki Champions because you just shred them with the true damage you have with Nash's as well it's really good for on hit right and once you get something like riff maker you're actually very hard to stop I actually think Gwen is almost like blind pickable now again you just have to be really careful against Champions like Canon and Jace range Champions who can kind of avoid jumping into you Jax might be pretty good as well because he can block a lot of your damage so there are a couple of counter picks you might have to be careful of but Gwen with the new Nash's two pretty good pick I would just highly recommend guys running something like United teleports you have a lot of cool pressure and you still have map pressure with your amazing split pushing and wave clearing in the mid to late game now another champion who really enjoys split pushing is clear but Club probably enjoys a little bit more teams running of course getting those flanks off of your ultimate and the reason kled is here is quite simply because kled with Eclipse because they buff this and turns the actual light passes cooldown this is really nice for clat for sure a bit like aatrox right you're missing the omnip a little bit but you are getting ability hose from Eclipse now ever since they did change this but make sure guys you're actually preceding Eclipse with ravenous Hydra you want to get this stacking ASAP and tear Matt well you really need it for wave clear otherwise it's very hard to manage waves in the Top Lane and shove them out you'll get Frozen on and yeah the lane is GG also be very careful guys of playing clad into Fiora and malphite these two are your two big hard counters especially if you're because you can block pretty much everything you throw at her it's impossible to actually ever go in malified as well because of his armor stacking and because he got buffed ready just tanks anything he throwed him so be careful about Rock Solid but yeah Clay does here as well with eclipse and ravenous Hydra and platinum and above he's even classified as an S2 Champion Now One champion who really does like literally fly under the radar is Quinn and we really see Quinn being picked and I guess I could put on like each of these videos right as low key broken because she does do well in terms of like win rates right because not many people play but when they do player they're probably like Quinn experts the point here I'm making is that lots of bruises are still very good right so if you think a champ is like maybe Jax Fiora all you have to do against these Champions is pick Quinn no one really like knows how to deal with this champion in the Top Lane when they're MLA Champion so it's just awesome to pick her right just great to have in your champion pool just be aware guys that matching your W first on Quinn even though they did nervous I can't remember if it was last season or the season before but they did Nerf this ride in terms of the attack speed and the bonus movement Speed Max is first though because Maximus first means you have more Kaiden National just DPS because you're stickiness so yeah make sure you do that instead of matching your Cube but yeah Quinn in the Top Lane whether you're going something like crack and Slayer into the blade of the ruined King whatever it is you're building the champion just does very well because of a kit now Silas is the next Champion guys so if you want to counter one of these tanky top laners you're seeing so it might be something like a malphite it might be maybe a Gnar in the Top Lane because the ultimate you get maybe you see Alistair pictures of support but yet we're talking about Top Lane here even against stuff like on you can do well because yeah orange ultimate is really good the only issue for Silas guys if you pick him in the Top Lane and I know I should really be like begging him up here and encouraging you guys to pick him yeah the only bad thing is that your early laning phase can be pretty bad against lots of these Champions right so do be careful about picking Silas into just like an ad champion who has a really bad ultimate for you you are picking Silas as a pure counter pick do not blind pick this guy in the Top Lane you will wish you'd never been born but yeah Silas is the first AP Champion the last AP Champion if the Top Lane is Teemo and next patch because Nash's tooth the ability he has is getting buffed this is great for you when you rush this item and then you get what Riff maker if you're against some sort of like bruisery Champion or you can even get leandra's anguish right to put those shrooms around the map you don't really want to get in a fist fight with them it really depends right but yeah leandra's anguish team mode for Timo with Nash's tooth I think it will actually benefit probably more than leandra's anguish build right because yeah the ability has this means you can put more shrooms around the top side of the map or both side of the map depending on where you are but yeah I think turbo will be even better than 13.6 because of this buff ability haste he will appreciate this so the yordo is in this countdown now moving to the mid lane we actually kind of mentioned one of these champions in terms of the Top Lane but you're just playing this guy in the mid lane this is male fight and the Unstoppable force in the mid lane I'm being with Jitter by the way is actually really pickable but I'd highly recommend once again guys to pick malphite mid lane against attack damage Champions because you're so tanky now because of the buffer I gave you it's very difficult to even push you out of the mid lane and your level six is so huge right especially in solo queue because lots of people play like carry junglers not many people are gonna be picking you know kind of like those utilities support based junglers but yeah just remember that your early game isn't the strongest in the world but if you can pick malphite into something like maybe a Yasuo an irelia or something like this all you have to do is press e and you automatically win Lane Now One champion who is really underrated he's actually a rod of age as abuser and I'm kind of surprised we don't see this Champion more in Pro play especially this is twist of fate now lots of matchups in the mid lane for twister fight are going to be difficult right you know just off the top of my head you've got fish you've got Yasuo who might be difficult you've got Tristana now as well very hard so if you are new to playing Tour survey guys using your W as key right understand that it's cooldown even though it might be kind of short around like seven seconds it's still very long okay so the best way to play Twisted fetish is to hold on to your W unless you actually you know are going for a stun or you're going to like Shelby minion wave be very careful about using your W and playing up into the enemy Champion's face so be careful of that but yeah Twisted fight with Rod of Ages and then if you're going something like I don't know rapid fire Cannon Lich Bay in which the buff right it really depends but a bit like malphite just think about your team composition a little bit if you have a jungler something like a graze or a very strong jungler carry jungler TF is more than happy just giving up his laid and helping out his teammates your Bot Lane might be something as well like a thresher felios TF works great with these Champions because you'll pick potential the multiple Roots you can land with your Champions so yeah think about your team in champside before just picking TF as well now the final mid laner to think about in 13.6 is Zoe and Zoe is almost classified well she is actually in a lot of elos there's an S Plus tier Champion reason for this is because well right I've actually buffed her more than me heaven and even though the durability meta wasn't really kind to Zoe because you're all about just like putting one Champion to sleep and then just piling all the damage onto that champion right it's not really the way people are playing League at the moment especially in Pro playwright but still the champion because that is such an effective way of playing the game is really open solo huge she's very difficult to beat major in the laning phase as any Champion yes so level 6 might not be like the best thing in the world and you have to be careful against certain Champions especially like assassins like Kiana Zed Talon Katarina right they will crush you at level six so make sure to hold your e and wait for them to go in but yeah Zoe in the mid lane if you want to dominate and take over the game with insane priority she's a great pick now moving into the jungle we've got two Champions here both of these are AP Champions the first of these is Diana why Nash's tooth ability Ace you're going to enjoy this if you're going something like Nash's tooth into rocket build I just think this is going to be really good for Diana and that's exactly the same guys for shyvana as well if you're going something like Nash's too then into night Harvester you're just gonna have a field day actually still thinks shiv is like a pretty good AP jungler you've just got to be very careful about having weak laners like if you have a Soraka vein bot Lane you have like some I don't know scaling mid laner like vegar Rebellion Soul most of the time you're not going to be able to get to the mid to late game which is when you can pop off right visual Nash's with your knight Harvester so again be careful about just picking shyvana if you have really late game Champions already locked in now moving down to the bot Lane guys now these two ad carries you can actually play in the mid lane if you wanted to in 13.6 so the first of these is Kaiser why she on her Nash's tooth and it's actually a really good item for AP cars so you get the attack speed and you get 100 AP this impacts two Evolutions right so that's really nice and this will make yeah luden's Tempest National tooth Kaiser even more viable but just be careful about picking up in the mid lane because yeah your laning phase really isn't that great You've Got No Escape So You're vulnerable to ganks ride especially against hard CC Champions so yeah be a little bit careful there because from the mid lane will definitely be better aloki broken in the right circumstances exactly the same for Varys as well but Varys is just a little bit better during the laning phase so I think this pick will be better overall and because you're getting ability hey so this means you can throw out more ultimate and of course more poke I think Varys might even be picked a lot more in higher reloads as well to really get priority and dominate the mid lane with a good early game jungler but yeah those are the two Eddie carries and you can even play them in the mid lane if you really want to now the last role to talk about guys of course is the support role and if you are enjoying these videos make sure you let us know by leaving a like down below and the three supports the first of these if you want to play like an anti-engage support 4 then Belvedere is amazing like well pretty much most of these supports are already engaged because the meta at the moment is really revolving around engage right so belvith because you love Champions who come into you right you love it when those fights that are close quarters belvith really loves this and this is why she's actually picked a lot in high reloads as a support to counter those engages now another champion who would appreciate playing against these Champions is Fiddlesticks now you might be like but Fiddlesticks would really love playing until like you know enchantresses because they lack Mobility but the problem with this is that if they have brains it's pretty difficult to get on to the right because they're playing at range you want Champions to be close to dive onto your teammates and bang in you go over the wall those Fiddlesticks they're so close to you you fear every single one of them and GG you win the game just because you counted those close range champions the last support guys if you don't want to play bell pepper or fiddle six this has got to be suede yes you can pick Swain in the mid lane which is why yep even Fiddlesticks and even Belvedere you might think they're going into the jungle next minute they're down in the support role and it throws people off lots of people don't know how to play against these Champions particularly the first two bill worth and Fiddlesticks but Swain is just another option you guys have with all the tanks in the game at the moment as well on the HP the engage supports right with their HP leandros angle Swain is really good right now but yeah once again be careful about just blind picking these Champions because if they do have some sort of range like zerath works right something like this even Cinema Duo you have to be careful about just picking them like that but those were the 15 most likely broken Champions guys for 13.6 any questions let me know in the comment section and until our next season 13 upload the Spinners foreign ","57":"I have a secret that I'm ashamed to admit I have been playing League of Legends since season two that's 11 years of my life that I've been playing this game in that time I could have started a family earned a PhD or made Millions off of cryptocurrency no I set my goals far higher to achieve the rank of Challenger and guess what I did exactly that achieving the rank of Challenger multiple Seasons as both a mid lane and jungle Mane here's the thing though Once Upon a Time on a 60hz monitor little hexadecimal was bronze I just like you had to start in those lower ranks and the only way to the top was to learn and improve looking back though my methods for improving were far less than ideal but with years of experience I started to refine my process of improving and you know what I actually kind of got good at it you see League of Legends isn't the only game that I played competitively for these past 11 years I have played a wide variety of game genres I was able to hit Legend in Hearthstone a card game a mortal 3 in valorant and Global Elite in CS go which are FPS games and Masters in Starcraft an RTS game now please don't think I'm saying this to brag or to show off or anything like that as a part of me died inside from cringe after I listed my so-called accomplishments in video games the point I was trying to make is that over the years I've been able to get good at a wide variety of games across a lot of different genres and the only way I was able to do this was not by mastering a single game but mastering the process of improving at games and so this guide really stems from a thought experiment if I could go 11 years back to the past and start over how would I have learned League of Legends differently and well if I'm being honest if a service like ours at skillcap.com existed back then well it would have made my life a whole lot easier not only do we have over 280 high quality courses taught by Challenger experts covering every role and skill you need to learn in order to rank up but we also released 10 new Smurf commentaries every single week on our site where a challenger player teaches you how to climb out of the exact rank you're stuck in and if you're someone looking for something more personal instead well then we got you covered with coaching from our train Challenger experts if all of this wasn't enough we're also backed by a rank up guarantee if you don't significantly improve while actively using skill capped well then you get your your money back no questions asked so what are you waiting for click the link in the description below and get the rank you've always wanted alright so if skillcap didn't exist then what would I have done differently well the first thing I would tell my past self is to stick to one Champion whether it's a champion in League of Legends a deck and Hearthstone or the Vandal or Phantom invalorant you need to try to make the game as consistent as possible for you to start learning the greater fundamentals the reason for this is that if you don't have at least a basic Mastery of wealth the basics of A Champion that you're playing well then it will be nearly impossible to improve at any other aspect of the game such as strategy Wave Control trading literally everything this is an issue that comes up in every game for example if your actions permitted are too low in Starcraft well then it doesn't matter what build order you're using you'll always be behind if your aim is terrible and valorent well it won't matter if you used a better tactic to give you an advantage in the gunfight you're still going to lose and if your combos kiting Etc is so bad with your Champion it won't matter if you made the correct roam or traded at the right time individual Champions all have Unique Mechanics to them and so you need to stick with one to develop the basic muscle memory and skill with those Mechanics for example how would you learn the concept of tempo in a card game like Hearthstone if you constantly switch decks and have to relearn the basic card interactions and combos if you switch Champions while you're constantly forcing yourself to relearn the basics and resetting your progress the core rule here is that Mastery comes from building on previous knowledge when you remove those fundamental pieces of knowledge that you built up like how your Champion works and switch to a new Champion you've now gone backwards and will have to spend more time just to get to your previous level okay great so maybe I've convinced you with this is the way forward but you're now wondering well how exactly do you develop Mastery on One champion well there's a simple two-step process I Implement in every single game I play first is reviewing your own replays when you do this don't make the mistake of thinking this is when you answer questions that you have instead reviewing your replays is all about taking notes of what questions you have for example let's say you're a top laner playing Renekton and you review a replay where you're playing against adarius starting from Level 1 you should have questions like should I be trading with Darius at level 1 should I be trying to push or freeze the wave Etc you want to write these questions down during your replay review process the second step is then launching top players on the same Champion or matchup now when you watch those players you know what questions that you need answers to so it becomes much easier to learn from them compare this to if you make the mistake of only looking at top players but never reviewing your own replays you'll never know what you're doing wrong or what questions you need answered from these top players at the same time if you don't look at the top players then you'll find the questions you need to ask from your own replays but then you'll have to rely on yourself not an expert to come up with an answer which will be incredibly slow and inefficient this is why to start always try to learn the game through the lens of One champion now after you've done this you will eventually get to a point where your Mastery of One champion is starting to Peak and you're getting severe diminishing returns your combos are good your kiting is good your last setting is good your map awareness all the muscle memory and hand-eye coordination is starting to become relatively good and your hitting diminishing returns you're not climbing as fast as you did initially once you're hitting this Plateau with your single champion this is when you need to Branch out and learn what your enemy does keep in mind by making sure that we Master One champion first it means you've now learned what it takes to get good at a champion this then makes switching to a new Champion much easier since you know the common questions to ask for example let's say you're an Ari Main and you try out Fizz wow this guy's wave clear is terrible you think you've now learned that Ari has a strength you weren't even aware of before wave clearing and that fizz has a clear weakness it's through this process you begin to understand both your own and other Champion strengths and weaknesses and win conditions you're developing match-up knowledge and although at first it may seem like you need to play hundreds of individual Champions this simply isn't true these matchups will get extrapolated into archetype knowledge by your brain for example galio who just wants to wave clear in mid and then Rome is very similar to Twisted Fate's playstyle Silas akali NZ all have similar play Styles in Lane same with control Mages like Vex and Zoe on top of this you don't actually need to master every single one of these Champions instead said you just play as many games as needed for you to get a feel for their strengths and weaknesses this is often one to three games and now I know you're probably thinking hey are you really giving the advice to play every single champion in the game one to three times you know I kind of have a life unlike you well here's the thing you don't try out every Champion you just try out the ones that are the most popular in the meta at the time so for example as of writing this guide It's patch 12.23 the top 5 most popular mid laners are Zed akali Katarina syndra and Yasuo if you combine their pick rate together that's 51.2 percent pick rate that means if you spend a weekend just trying out these five Champions to learn their strengths and weaknesses you will have insights into over 50 of the matchups you're going to face in mid lane this is the foundation to improving and mastering a game extremely fast you first stick with one champion and master it then once you plateau and hit diminishing returns you spend time trying out the current meta Champions you're facing this will then give you much deeper match-up knowledge as well as a better understanding of your own Champion strengths and weaknesses relative to others now those previous two tips form the foundation of our learning so let's start building on it what I'm about to teach you is probably the most common mistake I see players make that hold them back from improving it's that when they're learning League of Legends they default to playing far too passive they play at a low risk play style and then slowly go more aggressive over time this is incorrect and severely damaging your ability to improve instead you want to do the opposite you want to go too aggressive and then slowly peel back that aggression over time this is what's commonly referred to as limit testing and it's a far more effective way to improve by going too aggressive you will get immediate feedback on whether it was right or wrong for example you're in lane and you're thinking to yourself do I win if I go in for a trade here your response to that should be to immediately go in and trade and find out this way you get immediate clear feedback you'll either win or lose the trade you've now learned something compare that to if you had asked the same question do I win if I trade here but instead you played passive well you've now learned nothing since you got no feedback you're still left with that same question but you never got an answer to it this is how you get hard stuck and stop improving so as you play be conscious of when you feel unsure of something whether you're questioning whether to roam all in trade recall never default into choosing the passive option make yourself do the aggressive option not because it will result in a win for the current game you're in but because you'll get an answer to your question that will then impact every future game that you play moving on I'm sure you've heard this exact piece of advice before league isn't about kills league is about objectives well I'm here to tell you that's actually wrong league isn't about kills or objectives league is about gold and stats the correct decision you make will always be the one that results in generating you the most gold to truly understand this concept you first need to understand that every stat in the game has a gold value associated with it and every stats gold value is derived from the least expensive basic item that provides only that stat for example here's a chart showing that from the League of Legends Wiki this means not only can every single item in the game literally be calculated in terms of its gold efficiency of the stats it provides but it also means every time you level up your base ads and crease and these base stats can also be represented Again by a gold value essentially the relationship between stance and gold is pervasive across every interaction in League we go for kills and objectives and last it all to generate gold which we then spend on items these items are then purchased because they increase our stance once you truly understand this it's kind of like becoming Neo and seeing the code in The Matrix you realize that the optimal play will always be what earns you the most gold per minute or in other words what is increasing your stats the most per minute this is actually why dying too much is the biggest mistake players make while dead you are always generating the least amount of gold possible if you set a goal to die less you'll immediately see results as it will force your decision making to be more optimized around goal generation per minute this is also why the second biggest mistake players make is taking fights or making plays that are very risky when there are other free safe resources on the map this is what's referred to in economics as opportunity cost the loss of potential gain from other Alternatives when one alternative is chosen and don't worry there's actually really an easy way to understand this concept if we use a term from the game of poker called expected value just like League of Legends poker is a game of odds and probability let me explain in order for players to make decisions that are most profitable in poker they use a symbol calculation that they call expected value and this may sound fancy but it's honestly a very simple calculation let me use an example in League of Legends let's say you're in mid lane and a fresh minion wave has just arrived you then see a fight occur in the bottom river between both junglers you now have to decide whether to react to the fight or Farm the wave mid so let's calculate the expected value of both plays first you need to estimate the gold value of going to that fight in this case let's say it's a kill on the enemy jungler that's 300 gold you then need to estimate the gold value of the alternative which is farming the six minions in mid lane that's 125 gold you then need to estimate the probability of both scenarios happening in the case of farming the six minions in mid lane it's a 100 chance you'll always Farm those six minions if you decide to stay day however for reacting to that jungle fight let's say the enemy jungler is around 70 health and your jungler is around 30 percent the majority of the time your jungler should lose and there's no guarantee you'll be able to get to the fight in time before he dies or that the enemy jungler will move towards your direction for you to then kill him now league is not an exact science you're basically having to make your best estimate in terms of the probability of that play working out in this case I'm not trying to teach how to have an accurate probability so let's just summarize it briefly by saying based on my experience there's probably around a 30 chance at best that we get a kill here well to calculate expected value all you have to do is multiply the gold reward by the chance of it happening so if we stay in farm in mid lane we'll get 125 gold 100 of the time that means the expected value of that play is 125 gold if we react to the fight in river we will earn 300 gold 30 of the time that means the expected value is 90 gold so as you can see in this situation sting and farming mid lane will be the better choice as more often it will be a more profit affordable play in the long run now before you start typing in the comments section I know this was a gross simplification of much more complicated Concepts and calculations but it's a way to illustrate that this is what we mean by good decision making in League of Legends choices in League of Legends aren't right and wrong in the absolute sense instead decisions will be based around probability and having good decisions just means you're choosing an option where the expected value is higher than the alternative now please don't misinterpret what I'm saying here I'm not telling you that you need to be calculating expected value in real time as you play that would be absolutely insane instead the reason why I went into all of this is so that you change how you look at the game when you look at a choice you make whether it's to roam to react to a fight and take power plates to farm a wave to take a camp don't think of these options as being right or wrong instead assign a probability and a gold reward to them often you don't really need to do some kind of high level expected value calculation it will just be obvious which one is better relatively fast oh I can push a wave and take at least one turret plate into of trying to react to a fight in bot Lane that would be a 100 chance for like 300 gold with the minions and turret plane maybe you have at best two kills possible on the roam bot side that's 600 gold from The Kills so all you need to do is know whether it's less than a 50 chance of us getting those kills if so then the expected value would always be less than 300 gold and so it would always be better to stay and farm the wave and take a plate you can see how just by being aware of this concept you no longer look at League of Legends the same it will give you a clear way to evaluate correct and incorrect decisions based on far more objective values rather than just what feels right and now that we've talked about viewing League from the lens of probability it transitions great into this next tip and that is when possible you always want to try and engage in smaller fights rather than larger ones for example in a one versus one you're 100 of your team you can think of this as having like 100 control over the outcome of the fight however in a 2v2 You're Now 50 of your team 3v3 would be 33 44 25 five twenty percent even when you're significantly ahead in Gold taking a straight 5v5 fight can actually be far riskier than you realize simply because you're losing agency over the outcome as you have to rely more on your teammates playing correctly you basically have to accept the fact that league is a team game and thus the more teammates involved in any play will reduce your impact on the outcome of it however this is also why creating number advantaged fights is extremely powerful you can think of the difference between a 2 versus 2 fight and a three versus two fight to be a 50 increase in the power of the team that has that man Advantage this is why tactics centered around creating number advantages are so powerful for example that's exactly what roaming and ganking accomplish as a tactical play they are forcing a fight where you have a man Advantage this is why roams and ganks are so powerful and create positive outcomes so consistently alright so at this point I've given you a lot to think about and it's probably a bit overwhelming for some of you and that's where this next tip comes in when you're trying to improve at League of Legends you always want to to focus on one thing at a time don't make the mistake of having a laundry list of multiple different things to learn and then trying to improve at all of them at the exact same time don't dig 1000 small Holes Dig one hole but extremely deep for example review one of your replays and pick one thing you're confused about one thing you want to be better at and then hyper focus on getting good at that one thing don't move on until you're satisfied with your current level of Mastery over that one thing you selected often players think that they're doing this but they're not going as granular as they need to be like maybe they set their focus to be mastering Wave Control that's still a bit too large that encompasses multiple different scenarios and Lane States instead continue to reduce it down specifically what about Wave Control let's say when should I be freezing waves good now we're on the right track from there you can focus your efforts on that when you played when you VOD review and learn from external resources and you simply do not move on from that until you've achieved a Mastery that you're happy with and you may be okay with focusing on one thing at a time but you may feel a bit confused on what exactly that one thing should be well when possible you always want to begin focusing on what comes first not last or in the middle League of Legends is a linear game each game begins at the same starting spot the side effect of this is that the earlier in the game it is the more replicable your actions can be the longer the game the more variations occur and the higher the chance you'll find yourself in unfamiliar Waters this is actually unique to League of Legends not every game is like this for example in the game of chess a lot of Chess experts and coaches actually recommend players to learn the end game first not the opening this is because in chess the end game is actually what's replicable and consistent and has the least variation this is because at the start of the game there's the most pieces on the board and so there's the largest amount of possible options and moves players can make but by the end of the game there are fewer pieces and so there's less variation and things are more predictable the point is the advice chess coaches give about learning the end game stems from that same principle begin your focus on parts of the game that are most consistent and predictable in League of Legends this is the early game so when possible for focus on mastering what comes at the beginning of each game these are things like your routes as a jungler your levels one to three as a laner etc you want to focus on these first as you'll get the best results since what you've mastered can now be applied literally every single game compare this to if you mastered a concept or tactic that only happens at 30 minutes in a few games well you won't be applying what you've learned very often and so it will have less of an impact on your overall climb and finally I'd like to leave you with an important state of mind to have when you play League of Legends and that state of mind is that everything matters and nothing is equal let me explain because league is a real-time strategy game there is no break once the game begins it's basically a marathon of who can be the most consistent and optimized with their decision making every single second and just like how there's no break in the game there's also no way to get into a tie or a situation where no player can gain some sort of advantage for example there is no such thing as a wave state where both players are tied or even the wave can always be manipulated and there's always a superior Lane state to be acquired for both players Laney is effectively two players fighting to acquire their own respective most winning game States if one player has a winning wave state for them then the other is trying to claw back from the losing state it is not possible for two players to be in a Winning State simultaneously in League of Legends the way you can implement this into your own games is to realize things like if you're pushing a wave without knowing why you're pushing or whether pushing is a good or bad thing for you in that moment then you're playing the game wrong if you don't know whether you're in a winning or losing position you'll never be able to decide what to do next what the correct decision is far too many players make the mistake of just kind of existing and then only making decisions every so often they mistakenly think that league has moments of dead time where nothing is really happening and then there are these big bursts of key moments that is not the case and not how League Works league is an accumulation of small decisions and actions that are occurring every second the reason why high level players are so good is because they are constantly trying to move towards a more Winning State in their games regardless of how far ahead or or behind they are so whether you're ahead or behind in your games when you find yourself in moments of autopilot when it's not clear what the next move is what the more winning state is to aim for take note of those moments that is often where your biggest mistakes lie and what is causing you not to climb instead of letting those autopilot moments pass go into them with a magnifying glass go to the replay look at the moment in time where you didn't know what the next move was and make discovering the answer your focus this is often a great solution to that problem players have where they don't know what they're doing wrong or what they should be focusing on our right so here's how I would have learned League of Legends if I could start over first I'd pick one Champion I like and focus on mastering it as my first goal that means playing at least 100 games with that champion before I consider doing anything else during that time I would do a combination of Replay analysis and reviewing top players on that champion this way I know what questions to ask and then can find the answers from those better than me next I would then Branch out and play one to three games on the most popular meta champions in my role while playing them I will focus on trying to understand and identify their strengths and weaknesses compared to my own champion this is the beginning of developing more in-depth match-up knowledge I will also consciously play more aggressive with the intent of limit testing this way I can get immediate feedback if I play too passive then I'll never make the mistakes I need to make in order to learn and improve I would also change my perspective on League to view it through the lens of optimizing gold generation per minute I would do my best to avoid vague subjective feelings of what's most valuable and instead try to evaluate correct decisions based on what Nets me the most gold per minute a dish additionally I would try to view decisions as one based on probability it's not what is the right or wrong decision but what has the highest chance of producing a good outcome this would allow me to start favoring decisions that are more stable and consistent and avoid riskier more volatile choices when playing the game I would also try to maximize my impact by reducing the amount of times I'm participating in large even number team fights simultaneously I would try to put my focus on learning tactics that set me up to have Team fights with a number Advantage as they are one of the most consistent ways to win fights as I'm learning I would choose one thing to focus on at a time and try to develop significant Mastery over that prior to then moving on to learning something else additionally I would try to shift my focus to learning things that happen at the beginning of the game as this will provide the greatest results in the long run and finally I will try to identify moments in the game where I don't know whether I'm winning or losing and what my next move should be the goal of this being to slowly build over time the ability to have a clear game plan on what I should be doing at All Phases of the game alright before we wrap this up let's tell you a little more about skill capped so we offer a five division rank up guarantee and think that's a pretty crazy thing to offer that's like a gym membership guaranteeing you'll get ripped your local gym would go bust if they offered that right well not us we've offered this for years because our service really does work it works so well in fact that we're able to produce by far the largest catalog of Premium League of Legends guides on the entire internet not only do we have over 280 high quality courses taught by Challenger experts covering every single role and skill you need to learn in order to rank up but we also released 10 new Smurf commentaries every week on our website where a challenger player teaches you how to climb out of the exact rank you're stuck in those same experts also respond to any questions that you have so sign up today for as little as 6.99 a month to improve fast and get the rank you've always wanted Link in the description below alright I hope you guys enjoyed this one I know it was a lot more theoretical in nature compared to our usual guides but the hope is that it still helps and that you can learn a lot from it if you have any questions by all means leave them in the comment section below and and I will do my best to answer them we here at skill Camp want to thank you for watching and we'll catch you in the next one ","58":"what's going on game weepers here we go May the 10 list for 13.7 that isn't gonna do anything for your rank but it will do something for your pseudo knowledge about the game but just before we do get into the video one thing you guys have to do before you get into your next game is to download the poor Professor app Linked In the description because it allows you to quickly import the best room page used from the best players in the world on the champion you're picking you don't have to make the room page just one click of a bun and bang you're ready to go but that's not all because the app also allows you to scale your opponent and the app will give you their stats how well they play their Champion so you can know more about your opponent than they know about themselves and the app also gives you an in-game overlay so you can compare your CS in your cool participation to your rank or even Challenger players like Faker and there's a reason why 3 million people have downloaded this free application guys it's because it works so get around it in season 13. those links are in the description but anyway guys let's tell us let's start by talking about the best Top Lane isn't the worst Top Lane is according to our tailor so I'm broken we have Fiora Jack's malphite and Riven now I don't really have to go into too much detail here Riven has actually moved up into broken tear because the eclipse build malphite is here because the reason Buffs Jack's because he's season 13 Jacks and Fiora because well yeah it's season 13 for you as well a bit more tank scene in the Top Lane and Fiora has so many winning matchups she's classified as an S Plus their champion in pretty much every single ELO as well now as far as Champions who actually got changed in 13.7 or who will get changed well we have Grace who's staying in BT yes you're getting a bit more bonus and your ultimate cooldown is going down but it doesn't really change too much so yeah just a b tier kind of standard top laner but maybe Champion a bit more significant in the Top Lane Olaf is getting nerfed so as far as your passive attack speed goes so the lower you are the more attack speed you get this is going down in the early game and also your cues damage the base damage down by five and because you're maxing this first this will definitely mean something or you're laning phase okay so Olaf won't win as many lanes but he will still be very strong that's why he's an S tip now sejuani is good enough to throw cooldown increasing and her ultimate cooldown also increasing but she'll still be kind of an okay top laner she's remaining a b tip we also have Wukong who's dropping down to B2 because your early game's kind of getting hit here big time as far as your base attack damage goes down by two and your WS cooldown is going up at later ranks doesn't really mean too much but your ease bonus attack speed so when you earn and you get that bonus attack speed this is nerfed by five percent in each rank which means your conquer is stacking your DPS everything is just down here this will affect Wukong quite a lot in the Top Lane you really just want to be picking him if you're counter picking a champion specifically and that's the same for Lee soon as well that's why he's dropped to see tear from pizza because exactly the same nerves here base attack damage is down by two and your base armor is also down and guess what on the top Lane most of the time you're going to be versing attack damage Champions so Lee sin is worse off now apart from this what else is getting changed well abyssalmers you're getting more HP so if you are a champion building abyssalmaster one of those tank top laners you're going to be enjoying this a bit more doesn't really affect the Tail list though and death dance is getting well well I think buff because you're getting ability Haze again from the item so if you're playing something like a ribbon a Fiora or a Camille these bruises they actually really appreciate ability has so I think this is really good for a lot of Bruiser top laners and yeah Riven and Fiora are just gonna be cemented in S Plus here even more because this and maybe the final Champion guys to talk about here is Yasuo because his e is now going to go up to four stacks and the shield from your passive is actually High I think this will just be a better pass through yasu in the Top Lane I still don't think he's that great in this Lane I think you're much better off picking him in the mid lane but hey this will hold quite a lot that's why he's moving up a tip and if you guys have any thoughts on this Top Lane too let's let us know by dropping a comment down below mate now moving into the other solo Lane the mid lane here and you can see speaking of Yasuo he's in broken tip because of the Buffs next to him we have Talon the boss from last patch if you look at this guy's stats by the way in Challenger it's like 56 win rate hardcore s plus two Champion we have Annie despite her getting nerfed oh my God how does that work well she's getting her for a support version right so the e-backs Annie playing support doesn't really affect me Lane you're still matching your Q you're still gonna be you know you still have all the same strengths that's what I'm saying your eager getting Nerf doesn't mean anything for mid lane Annie and then we have action because he's just dominating every single rank he's been so strong for pretty much the entirety of season 13 and maybe even more so now because fighting you know it's sort of close range and that's what action likes if he gets out range it's kind of difficult to play this champion of course in the mid lane over 1v1 you have a gap closer ride but against lots of Team comps range does kind of calcu with engage on your size so especially if your supports roaming mid and those team fights there's more close range action right and Sean really enjoys this so I guess the meta just suits him right now that's why he's in broken too now Champion's actually getting changed in 13.7 we do have azir and guys honestly like I don't care what happens to this Champion I'm just gonna put him in Asia tip because that is his tier I guess but also yeah I don't know if these changes like w maxing okay your base armor going up is nice but are they really going to mean his win rate is going to be like even respectable I'm not sure now One champion whose win rate will definitely be respectable is Katarina's because of the Nash's tooth Nerf war yes it got changed but it was just a straight up Nerf the Catarina because it's an extra 200 gold you're waiting on that spy for longer then you don't care about ability he has but what you are getting this patch will have some compensation Buffs your passive AP ratio is going up by five percent so if you're building AP from rockapel Nash's may be right you're getting more out of your passive when you pick those daggers up and also your ultimate is just going to be dealing more damage based off your bonus attack damage so both build sofa cat and getting buffed that's why she's in low key broken but I think we kind of all know that she's going to be pretty good because of these changes now Graves unmoved exactly like Top Lane he's going to be staying in the b-tillas for mid lane that's why we already talked about him moving up all the way it's broken to now will other Champions well the only other Champion here really is vegar getting Nerf so your Q's AP ratio is now going to scale from 45 to 65 and this is changing from a flat 60 so at rank 5 or level 9 you will be getting more out of the queue but until that point it's going to be weaker right so as far as like you know lasting minions go as far as you know damaging the enemy Champion goes this is just going to be weaker that's the same for your W's AP ratio as well instead of being a fat 100 it's getting from 70 to 110 so at level 13 or 5 Points in your W it will deal more damage but getting to that point will be harder also your ultimate AP ratio same treatment 75 flat to a scaling 65 to 75 so it will be the same at level 16 but again guys it's going to be harder to hit these actual points on Vega so mid lane which is actually just his weakest role it's going to be more difficult there are a lot harder matchups in the mid lane so I'd only be picking Vega to cut kind of close range Champions and close range teams because of your event horizon that's pretty much it for the mid lane guys as far as like Loki broken Champions go we can't get into these in a future video so if you do want that yeah leave a comment like this video and yeah moving into the jungle roll for 13.7 the broken tier while three of these are unchanged Echo Evelyn and j4 these are not getting nerfed and I'm really surprised j4 is not getting enough because he's by far just to stand out jungler at the moment and yeah belvis has actually moved up a tier because it's Belvedere I guess belvith definitely deserves a spot here because well according to the stats anyway she is incredibly powerful right now with a lot more engage in the game she loves those close range team fights and she's really just frothing it that's where I was Jungle is getting changed in 13.7 Graves again this Champion is going to stay in the tier because I don't think the bus are significant enough to move him up so he's staying and AIDS it now what about other Champions well ramus is getting nerfed your W's percentage bonus armor is going down that's why ram ram has dropped down to 80. it'll still be good especially in the majority of elos so if you see a lot of attack damage on the enemy team just lock in the armadillo now we have Olaf kind of like the Top Lane Nerf right this is why Olaf is going down to Sea tier less attack speed from your passive less Q damage that will also affect your clear as well remember then we have sejuani so the actual damage to monsters going down your cues cool down an ultimate cooldown going up this affects you as well but not really that big and that's why she's dropping down to beat here from a tip at Wukong we talked about these Lee sin we talked about these notes so Wukong is going down to 80. Lee sin exactly the same both of these are down from s tier into a tip there are there any other jungles well there is one big change here this is to kha'zix now in yesterday's video I kind of like actually like misread this I'll hold my hand up like I went full Oceanic mode here and I actually traded this like oh the actual range of your Q is going down for some reason but the iso range is going down which means the enemy Champion being isolated from something is actually smaller now they don't actually have to be further away from that Minion or jungle monster whatever it is they can be closer to it and you still get the isolation so this means that radius is actually smaller and you get more opportunities to isolate them and therefore deal damage the W slow going down honestly doesn't mean too much like it's still gonna slow them enough for you to catch up to them especially if you go like Grudge or something later in your build and then your ultimate duration going up as well I actually think these are bus like seriously after reading these again and actually yeah turning off my Oceanic brain and turning on my EU Westborn brain this actually just looks really good for kha'zix maybe some kha'zix maybe would be happy with like your W getting changed and all that but yeah I actually think this is good for kha'zix just make sure you guys aren't playing as their jungle obviously and twitch jungle I think this is a massive Bay Playman as an ad carrier moving on to the ad character let's look where the playground is he is in broken tip alongside iron Jinx these three ID carries like you should be picking them in pretty much every single game they are the standouts now below them we have Draven Nyla Vega Vega is here to Spa getting enough because he's still gonna be good enough as an AP carry in the bot Lane this is by far his best role guys statistically it's a lot easier to get out of the Port Lane especially with a support next to you and because of the Port Lane at the moment is very close range you a lot of Champions especially even 80 carries who can't you know like dash out of it so if you're against an Ezreal it might be annoying and Lucian might be annoying right a vein might be annoying but if you're against a jinx or Draven is I you can just drop that a around them and they can't move right so it's pretty annoying to play against and Vega will still be good to spy the nurse now in locally broken we have Kaiser kalista who's getting Buffs through attack damage growth going up and maybe like the oak sworn Bond you know actual like time it takes to do that going down for your attack damage going up at later ranks this is definitely nice so she's in Loki broken and given the support meta actually thinks she'll be a really underrated pick then we have yaswood because of the changes maybe an e-max Yasuo in the bot Lane with like a nautilus or Alistair support is getting buffed and we'll talk about him very soon I think this will be quite deadly and the rest of the Taylor's guys is very similar to what it was in the last tier list now the last role to talk about guys of course is the Sapporo and if you have enjoyed this video please remember to leave a like down below and yes the support for 13.7 now there are none in low-key broken because not really many of them are getting changed alright thresh is getting Nerf but you will still have your death sentence up an awful lot that's why he's an S2 and as far as Alistair goes because of the base armor buff he's going up to 80 and yeah he has to base Health going up as well really helps him in that early lading phase he's going to be much more oppressive and just more dangerous just make sure you're taking glacier element with hex flash I think it's definitely the best way to play this Champion now as far as broken Champions go very similar to last patch has said that Annie is going down because of the support Nerfs to Annie right so if you're a Max and Annie it will be worse off but it will probably still be the way to go for support Addy but yeah I'm broken but it's gonna ignore those for a car and Santa these Champions have been buffed recently they are the cream of the crop the throttle supports go if you are playing support please have these champions in your champion pool and yeah apart from that guys there isn't really much changing for support so the tilis is staying largely the same any questions you have about the tier list drop a comment down below you can even have a round about the patch or the balance team being so good but yeah I will see you in tomorrow's season 13 upload guys thank you so much for watching the video this has been a all right ","59":"the new season has finally arrived and all the right don't seem to be aware of that it's time for all of us to go over the best Champions to main for each and every single role I'm your host for Caillou and I release this video every year with mobolytics and here we are not concerned with metapix although some of them may be very good meta pigs we are choosing the Champions that have the best consistency and Longevity and those that will be able to function in the widest variety of metas those that will not necessarily be thrown to the curb and ignored like volleyball or if you're a league Boomer Olaf if you remember that term from season 4 and of course they must work and function at every single rank for every single role so what makes a champion mainworthy in the first case and obviously defining it is important will timestamp everything for you so you can jump around and revisit it but there are various reasons why you'd want to main a specific Champion for the whole season of course I already mentioned the meta resistance whereby they won't be nerfed and sort of Forgotten and at the same time when you are learning a champion having it be in that situation just isn't very fulfilling it's not fun and when you want to have Champion enjoyment and fulfillment then obviously picking a champion that's gonna be good throughout the season and in future Seasons rewards the time you put in to actually learn them at the same time you want Champions that have a lot of skill expression when they're mastered that have maybe a low skill flaw if you're lower ELO High School floor if you're higher ELO but they all have a high skill ceiling you want to be able to see the fruition of the work you put in after 10 50 100 1000 games and for contacts that skill ceiling might not always be the sexiest and will start for the jungle of my personal content creation role and we will start off with Kindred because Kindred is not only supremely good in the matter and has been supremely good in the meta for some time they are the ultimate aggressive macro jungler we could put niddly here as well but at the same time nidalee is only really good at Master Plus Kindred can be used a lot lower than that and is all about a hyper aggressive jungling snowballing playstyle securing marks while in Jungle flow not compromising you a jungling for the marks but likewise being able to get them being able to scale is a good thing but a kindred who's behind is not really always having the most fun so the onus on this Champion is to have aggressive game plans that really just destroy the enemy jungle and allow them the most accessibility into Lanes whereby you destroy them get yourself fed and then you control the flow of objectives map Tempo taking the towers pushing it out it really is a jungler's champion but the kit itself is not particularly difficult to learn the kit itself has a lot of point and click but at the same time has a lot of nuance and mechanical outplay potential those that have 100 to 1000 games on Kindred looked vastly different as they increase those games up it also takes quite a few games to learn them but when you fuse it with good jungling and you kind of get better at jungling you also get better at Kindred and that's just something that rewards both those things together which is why they're probably gonna be great for all time obviously the ultimate is fantastic the dynamic gameplay from the simplistic kit with knowledge of damage output and damage absorption and positioning using the qw combo basically fantastic throughout all points in the game early mid late behind you can always come back in if you're ahead you can always just win and ultimately because you can always outplay the enemy chamber doesn't matter who you're playing against you can always have outplay ability that's something that's important when you want to main a champion but at the same time if your ADC carry sucks which let's face it sorry guys your section I'll praise you this section I've got to Flame you that's how it is you know what in the ADC section I'll say jungle dip for you okay but you can do their job for them you like the damage because your ADC is not in the game well you take the dragons you take the towers you do the back line you kill the tank you shred them with your Kraken you've got both versatility from here until Christmas and you are literally deaf how cool is that next up we have Zach who is not literally death but he's literally unkillable because of his sustained CC and honestly to high damage the first thing that comes to Champion maina's enjoyment and honestly Zach is one of the most fun tanks in the game for you to play you have a variety of combos unique orders you can use your CC specific sort of Niche things you can do like hey guy TP to my Bobbies or hey you doing a baron I'm gonna eat across a pit and smite that sucker from you throw is not the most dynamic champion in terms of jungling play Styles and game plans but at the same time the ganking strengths are just so funny because there's nothing anyone can do about it you push up I might kill you I'm gonna Max E and you will die hey hey guys you water deep doesn't matter I'm gonna go around and eat from the other side of the map you will die actively it feels like he's got a semi-global kit and then obviously when you get into the lane you've got your Q you put people together you're just such a social creature hey guys you look too far apart why didn't you kiss and hug and let's get on and have a good time together obviously you know you're having a better time but they don't really know that until they're dead versatile atomization might not always necessarily be the term we use here but you can go demonic damage if you want you should actually you can just go full tank and go radiant virtue and heal everyone in your teammates and you could also even go and even trout although I don't really recommend that so do we have itemization versatility hypothetically but if you're playing the champion probably demonics Embrace Jack show Sunfire you know just blowing up the map but essentially you've got the meta resistance because he's been so damn strong for so many years in fact even when I was first climbing many many moons ago that was one of the first junglers I used to reach my original Peaks is always by far the strongest CC tank in the game is great in class grade and solo queue grade and flag read a normal's grid in arams Greater Nexus blists great and Earth mode he's great all the time so you can stack the monastery points have the damage have the CC and enjoy yourself while the enemy does not next up we have Echo and you know what sometimes he goes through these periods where he's not played very much and then sometimes he goes through peers like no where he is played a lot sometimes I would like to take responsibility for that because when he's really strong and no one plays him I kind of put him in the best junglers Taylor so that I have I put him in my videos and say guys this is the best jungler to snowball it's AP so you can have your subies and Jonas and whatever else cringe 80 in the mid lane and you're able to do damage but he always has his place because now he can six Camp season 13 made him able to sixth Camp viably so you can have level 4 as a snowballing assassin and basically what that allows you to do is clear whatever you want in whatever Direction you want gank the lanes hit those beautiful W 2.25 second parallel conversion stuns on those counter ganks when the enemy junglers trying to get ahead of you the one thing that makes Echo beautiful to me is that he will always have the ability to clear at least sufficiently his counter game thanks a legendary and he will snowball doesn't matter when he will always reach it and because of his ultimate that safety button and the need to have a lot of CC to bust him out before he presses it as long as your positioning is good and you know how to flank you've got to talk about the skill ceiling that Echo has in terms of actually using the combos in conjunction with all of those other abilities you can basically make it so that you never see seed and burst it out you can hit your flash W combats you've got the rock about Flash W combos you've also got the rock about Flash e-combos you've also got an r that triggers his W you've also got beautiful ultimate Fade Away q2s Remember You Chuck the q1 out it will do damage on the way back as well so you've got a lot of flamboyance in your combos in the order in which you can use those abilities which basically again like Kindred makes you have the best app play ability which is great when you want to have a mechanical skill ceiling with a champion that can clear dominate scale secure objectives and be super super safe and again you can take your mid lane how about that or if you're Korean you can take some support don't do that next with fiddle six the golden poster boy for absolutely unique junglers that ride will always want to have better good win rate because only about three people play him more people should and they don't you should most people thought he would take a huge hit anyone who went to PBE was like well no my career is so slow it's like well did you just do a regular clear okay you're fine right there you go because it's healthy because he has damage because he can just sequence faster than anybody because he's got a game-changing ultimate because he scales and because he thrives against the AOE Aram gaming of solo queue he gives you the absolute full package to win the game in one moment shitty game just hit one Ultimate Team all threw a fight but everyone's low clean it up for the penta he is incredibly meta resistant because he is totally and utterly unique yes I put him as hard in my own personal ratings just because he's so different that there's not a lot of transferable skills which makes him one of the best Champions to main you're gonna have the learning process and he's never really in the patch notes unless he gets into the lane so Wright really want him to be in the jungle so you're never gonna have the issue where he just gets removed from the roll it forces enemies to consistently think about his positioning where he might eat from and with the ability to have a lot of Versatility and atomization although we do go rock above as standard it provides a lot of satisfaction to those junglers who like to think about the game in a unique way have you tried the hex flash tech for example that's a good one that's on my gameplay channel that is fun whereas Vai makes the ADC sorry again guys not have fun super reliable meta resistant pick and honestly not that great of a champion at the moment but also not that bad of a champion at the moment which means right or really care about her being in or out of the matter she's always gonna be Fringe because of her Simplicity because of her predictability but therein comes your ability to make our plays Hue flash flash cues you've got total lockdown with your ultimate for any Champion that might be in the game that frustrates you with Mobility you've got percentage HP damage you've got a shield passive your W's passive so if you're someone who doesn't like thinking about pressing buttons you know like a malzaha player then you know this is a good one really easy to pick up mastering her is knowing how to team fight position Target swap dive protect shutdown and of course Ensure sure you know how to peel something like a Rengar or kha'zix timing your cues accordingly so there is a lot of not so much mechanical ceiling but knowing when to use abilities against what Champions and also when you're simple and everyone can know what you're gonna do you have to be able to outplay them by knowing that before them you understand I'm gonna queue I know you're gonna queue I know you know I'm gonna queue oh I know you know that you know I'm gonna queue okay well then I'm gonna cue you okay you follow the benefit here is that you can also go Tanki fightery or more assassiny you want to be a hyper carry you want to go straight a joke for damage Spike into Trinity Force you like to find Sandra you like ravenous Hydro attack you like just being a beefy person with Divine Sandra all of these things work for you and solid Q flux q and whatever Q you like great press R GG well played now for 80 carry when you're not having a jungle difference moment and you can actually play the game see I told you I'd say it firstly we have to talk about Kaiser because obviously the most popular 80 carrying champion in the entire game outside of maybe like you know REM luck skins she works well into most comps yes she has a range issue and a scaling issue but she can work with most supports even onto the computer and help you through Landing phase great you have an Engaged support that can kind of go in and force you to Ultimate reposition also great a fairly safe pick overall provided you can Lane appropriately now she does also have a steep initial learning curve when it comes to damage limits with q w autos and passives and also learning her itemization along with her evolved abilities can be difficult but is honestly incredibly rewarding when you get it right and understand those spikes also has fantastic damage regardless of the targets you can pure bows and squishies you can tank shred and if you're a dumbass like me you're going AP Kaiser in the jungle for that three atom Spike of Destiny you build a noon quiver and then you do the full regular AP itemization build then you sell the new quiver for Crown boom balls three evolves it's terrible don't do it but it's fun and so that's the kind of thing that Kaiser presents great ability to outplay and self-peel with East delt movement that obviously gets that enhanced cooldown as well as the ultimate for repositioning in Shields getting the hang of her kit knowing the limits of how much you can take and how to position is the key to performing consistently while on this Champion but she will always be good he even when the win rate say otherwise except we have Varys who is a very consistent and somewhat underrated Champion except you know not really underrated recently but in terms of going bot Lane and actually being usable when he's not pro pickerban but more so in lower ranks his higher the players are always playing a lot of various especially at the moment but he can be played very effectively weak side all strong side depending on the matchups although that can be said for many things you know like game State and priority but at the same time because of his CC and the boss damage that he brings forth and the turn damage that he brings forth when people misplay on him that provides you a certain window into these opportunities that AOE crowd control is so useful when behind that as an ADC like ash when you have a really rough time in the game because again jungle difference or support Gap maybe but at the very least you will provide utility and prosperity for your team being able to lock down someone that they can't play around and say you're welcome guys he has various atomization options with unhit attack speed and AP meaning he's also suitable than off-roll if you wanted to go to the mid lane so you know again this best Champions to maintain thing kind of provides you the options to take things into other roles oh and of course he's great and fantastic at shredding targets with tons of Health making him brilliant at bursting through big tanky enemies who are Fighters but feel tanky because they're building tank atomization can we stop allowing this place right next we have Draven and when you're not egotistically cutting up an entire stake with nothing but your bare hands you have the ultimate one trick 80 carry here notorious for being extremely difficult but equally rewarding snobbles harder than almost any other champion in the game or ADC in the game ah he's up there definitely due to the gold generation passive meaning you can also 1v9 by snowballing much the way the junglers use Treasure Hunter and Future's Market basically you can Solo Carry if you get ahead in the early game basically if you're good in the lane and have good mechanics you can win the game you just have to get the hang of the catching axes interrupting dashes in anticipation with your e spamming the W movement speed to kite appropriately and obviously the global ultimate to use to finish off those targets all Miss entirely and go oh well while Draven Lanes do like to be aggressive he does work well with enchanted's utility supports engaging CC machines too and he can always get fed no matter what his support is or what the matchup is play perfectly and you will win and you will climb Draven is the prime ADC ego tool next up we have Jin the champion he probably had the best Champion release teaser ever made he is one of the most meta resistant Champions haven't been more than viable ever since his release and only really struggles Against full tank compositions or Champions like orn who have hard engage that can interrupt his existence he has always been a champion that is useful throughout games to the point that we're seeing him in support now but that is a little bit trolley please don't do that you're going to be useless because of his root because of the slows that he has on his ultimate and the range of it because he has vision control sort of with his traps so he has limited DPS compared to say other Auto attack based marksmen but the movement speed the passive damage the fourth shot he will still hit hard not as fast but he will hit hard and while his weaknesses might not be so obvious because they're not that glaring he's a solid lame bully when he has the the right support and he scales fairly well as well by that I mean he scales like a monster next up we have Samira who can feel a little bit trash in a lot of cases she can feel like she's a champion that's not going to perform well in certain parts of the matter but that means he's just more situational than other picks on this list but she still has that insane Solo Carry potential and it is immensely high if you can understand how to navigate weak lanes and weak metas then you have the ability to dominate entire games especially against comps with low CC due to your mobilities and resets on e as well as the sheer amount of AOE damage and healing she can now play enemies Against All Odds due to the wind wall mechanic in her W and her burst which of course she should never have that Windward mechanic but she has it and she also has outrageous aggressive bot Lane synergies With Champions like Nautilus and Rel although please I'd much rather see a rather's champion is actually very good and underrated use her and now we sprinkle ourselves over to the mid lane where the supports and junglers are coalescing for a good old-fashioned Smackdown of vioric aciden all of the cassidants on your team you should be doing that to gang for it some people might think this is a country traversal choice in this video but it's not because he's always good on the right hands especially if you have German descent it will always take some serious nothing and tinkering to make this Champion just not exist but then he just doesn't exist but he's always going to be good because of his scaling even when he's weaker early or struggling and laning matchups a good cast and will find ways to get fed get 11 get 16 and GG the game he's always been a good pick because of his strengths in the late game because of those spikes and probably some of the best scaling from the mid game onward you think you have a kale but when you have a Cassidy you've got to think about it the same way because kassadins are actually competent in the early part of the game he's very flexible with strong atomization the new Rod of Ages you've got Kronos Shadow Queen and also any of the other Mage mythics if you wanted the everfrost stun gaming essentially what you're looking at is a machine Gap closing one-shotting anti-mage shielding kind of goon squatting roaming 1v9 potential mid laner and the benefit of this Champion is that once you snowball him even with one or two gangs he can absolutely take over and if you're a jungler support you want that you want him to go bottling you want him to go Top Lane you want him to take biggest impact translated get 11 while everyone's eight and the game will just be over you don't need to wait until 16 to win with castle and you just gotta snowball them ahead of everyone else and just watch the Beauty unfold of a casted and one shot in their entire team the interesting one here is vax because she's been in a bit of a weird spot overall since her release people kind of thought hey she's good she's bad but you know what even if she kind of has issues in certain matchups it's important that you understand that all Champions on this list in every single role will have counters we'll have things that make them more difficult to execute but meaning that means you understand how to lose or play around those things gracefully so that you can accentuate those Champion strings because you're meaning them and you know them you live them and at the same time she has some incredibly good matchups making her a solid counter back into high Mobility low range Champions like your solo packs tons of crowd control which is very easy to apply with her W and this alone can win lanes and team fights and also so happens to have an amazing roaming capability with her ultimate and the resets can help her clean up and snowball easily it is pretty easy to pick up and learn does take some practice to play optimally but most places can get the hangover very quickly handle the lane appropriately handle the map appropriately and then dive from the suckers you want to kill I can't believe it's 2023 and was still putting anivia on these lists because you know what she's one of the most consistent and meta resistant mid laners ever now if you don't mind playing her because you don't fall asleep when playing her then you'll be absolutely fine because she's always been in a solid spot for carry potential amazing wave clear control and disruption in team fights use your wall use your AOE huge damage output playing in a choke hold okay anivia's gonna go gaming also brings great burst damage with it e and fantastic setup so it's perfect for your roaming supports and jungles to say come on over let's get a free kill while I'm sitting on Tower which is wave clearing and making it boring for the enemy mid laner however she can play aggressively and shut down melee Lanes easily if you get good at her but you can also play very safe and scale and farm into the late game it's your choice although as always if you can snowball please do so the biggest thing to learn is understanding how to utilize her wall correctly which is a large part of her skill sailing and why it's so high and also of course standing which item Break Even points bring forth the damage of the Gods next up we have Talon he has been flying under the radar you know sort of intentionally on that pun for a while he is a very healthy performance rated mid lane while not being permaband or nerfed because he is still kinda used in the jungle but at the same time they took away his clear speed in the jungle so we go back to kind of trying to shove mid as best we can we have of course the Tiamat technology and then of course roaming to affect the enemy jungle and side Lanes now he's one of the hardest Champions to punish in the game due to this crazy mobility and obviously the stealth when he has his ultimate the E power core means he can just run around the map like crazy and Snowball the whole game and stop by himself a true 1v9 carry Champion now he does have some funky damage combos you can learn which of course means you need to learn his damage limits especially alongside the passive bleed damage the overtime burst that he has as well as a slow on that W all in all it's of course about navigating the lane appropriately knowing that you can use your damage across the map and understanding at what break-even points your damage is going to do enough to take you over the edge finally for me we have akshan then of course you can take him Top Lane but very similar to Talon has huge impact on the games on the map easily a 1v9 champion and of course like Talon not going to be really focused in terms of bands and picks unless of course they go over the edge in terms of stats but at the same time they kind of fit that sort of you know Smurf 139 carry Champion that isn't really the focus of your high elos or your pro plays and just kind of flies under the radar and solo queue with something that just won benigns he offers Mobility again like Talon he offers stealth again like Talon and these things are low make him difficult to predict and play against the E resets make him a cleanup God in team fights and when he does clean up he has the potential to revive his whole team a balanced and enjoyable mechanic to face there's not many players that don't enjoy having an auction on their team as long as it's not the first time of course because he's difficult you have to learn how to play it and obviously there's nothing worse than having an auction mid against you as a jungler is absolutely insane kill potential in the early laning phase he can stop low range lanes and shut them out of the game very easily he's got a shield he can go Top Lane basically you just have to know how to play octron in Lane abuse your advantages and then affect the map most mid laners and top laners will not know how to face you and deal with you most won't see enough auctions to really truly understand his output and most will put themselves in a position that you can take advantage of them for support there's one Eternal enchantress that always seems to be in the meta and that's Nami because he's such a versatile support pick she works with an abundance of Lane partners and is a solid safe pick against most matchups she has notable super strong Lane pairings with Champions like Lucian but makes any Champion boasty with her e in fact she's just bursted she has everything you need for a support sustain CC movement speed Buffs poke she's got a huge AOE ultimate that she can use as a disengage or an engage her bubble and Ultima take a lot of practice to use consistently while so obviously more time spent equals more bubbles hit which means more Orleans which means more chain CC you get in the picture the champion can certainly feel unfront to play against when the Nami player has put in the time Mainzer and knows exactly what what to do and when obviously blitzcrank is the meta support God he has a Victorious skin he is something that cheeses all the time late invades early invades stealing bubs you know whether he's one shot and Carries On repeat in the laning phase with his hook and combo you know the knock-up and the silence or just letting one amazing hook to carry your team through a terrible game one crucial Target just gets heated in silenced and destroyed this is what blitzkering does in addition you don't just have hooks you have a lot of other qualities to offer his AOE silence on his ultimate can be awesome plus the fact that it instantly slaps down Shields that's nice this means he's a solid counter to heavy Shield cops and champions his e can interrupt Dash's which in certain matchups is insanely useful and there are a lot of things you can learn about laning with this champion in terms of looking for Windows gaps in the minion waves or Lanes cutting back letting the wave behave in a way that allows you to set up a perfect game for your jungler and obviously gives you the instant aggressive Edge for your team to open up roam opportunities in addition to those aforementioned level 1 invades and catches if you get good at blitzcrank and lend those hooks reliably you can Farm under level 5 as everyone will love having you on their team much like the Nami actually next up we have her Khan and even though he's not always in the best op spot where people are like yes Baker Khan he can always be great for a team in solo queue and actually he's in a fantastic spot going to the new season he was buffed not so long ago and people are sleeping on how good he can actually be Mobility Shields repositioning dancing ultimates he has the highest ability for any true support champion in the game and with this comes fantastic peel disengage and of course engage in ganking setup it's all dependent on how you use the Spells when you use the Spells and of course timing appropriate sustain and shielding good for carplay is a very hard to play against I can attest to this as I play a lot of support as well and they can dive into your whole team CC everyone and then slip back out again before you can even hit them frustrating to deal with and when a good Rook Camp pops off again a lot of honors and easy 139 carries even though no one will notice they'll think it's them but it's really you and to think you can do that while being stylish and flamboyant next up we are from not a glass really uniquely designed and absolutely disgusting into low range comps a recent support who's also in a very good spot but also can be absolutely disgusting in the right hands in fact she's been snatier for quite a lot since she was released and as people learned to use her kit appropriately the utility she provides comes in the form of simple CC in her queue but also has that of course AOE team fighting ultimate which you know makes everyone kill each other on the enemy team and then she's got Shields and slows and obviously the W potential Revival which of course you need to use appropriately but at the same time kind of broken when you do another support that just generally works so well with a variety of Champions in botland and when you want to play support and carry it from the background Harry without anybody realizing it you want something that can just amplify your team the whole time and scale late game into those team fights understand who the win condition is but if you pair yourself with an aggressive diving ADC like a Draven or Samira you can really push the limit and snowball even in the laning phase 2v2 and 2v3 very very quickly and of course with that lead now that late game becomes the mid game and you can just close that with obviously the utility in the kit just remember a crucial hook a crucial w a clutch ultimate can turn even the worst games into winning games when you're playing this Champion keep your head up know who you have to play around and look for your cooldowns to be used appropriately relevant to the enemy's damage and obviously you know make the pick make the win an unmaking picks we already have the blitzcrank let's throw in trash thresh of course just got buffed because he was struggling but he is the original overloaded support kit he said a new standard back in those days with what design could bring in the role and yet he still provides all of that now and he still has a ton of things to learn and you can really become a dominant support player when you one trick this champion and know everything about him obviously hitting those hooks is absolutely beautiful tugging yourself towards them knowing all the combinations of your plays and Flash plays and play flashes and then of course you've got the lantern which is what really frustrates people because you can decide fights gank skirmishes and anything if you know who to Shield properly or bring in your jungle for the gang or how to save your ADC from themselves thrush definitely takes more practice than other supports not because necessarily of his high difficulty although he does have that but because of how well you have to play to make him that much more impactful than his opposition sometimes he just isn't in a good state but a beautiful thrash player will be able to maximize and make him look broken if Sona is staying alive for example and spamming heels and poke but you are missing all your cues you're failing your flays you don't know how to flash properly you don't have hex flash you can have a rough time scaling into the game you'll just be abused out of Lane play to thy strengths Mr thrash and one of the biggest reasons for mating thrush throughout the season is because he's just so damn fun to play well there's nothing more satisfying than 2v3 alongside your Dua partner in that bottom Lane when those games come and you're in the zone you've put in the time you're lining every hug every fly every Lantern is perfect you're moving around the map with flow you're ganking mid you're ganking top you're dead for the herald you're there for the dragon and everywhere thrash isn't everyone loves thresh and finally we move to love Island where two people will try to reconcile the differences in a good old-fashioned fist fight Riven is the first one up and she's probably the Top Lane Champion you'll get the most rewards from based upon the time you spend playing her when we say Champion has tons of animation and canceling Combos and tips and tricks we literally mean that when it comes to Riven and this will take you a fair amount of time to master and a solid amount of hours in practice still to really get right then you've got to learn all the matchups the limit tests in the build options and how to player at each stage of the game too he takes practice to play while in team fights as well you need to understand wave management you need to understand split pushing and you get the point about how much you need to learn to make this Champion work but once you've spent that time and I don't mean to make it sound overwhelming but it's true it takes time you will have a super fun very well designed Champion you know not for enemy people but for you who could really outplay her enemies against all the odds and always has a little niche part of the matter where she's hidden op and no one really plays her anymore so you get away with it next up we have one of the most chad-like champions in the game Shen not too much needs to be explained about him because we all know what his ultimate does at this point but this Champion has always been one of the most consistent performers for as long as we can remember and he works in any single team comp it's very easy to pick up and learn on a basic level his kid is straightforward you know with a toad and of course bringing your Q for the extra damage and your W to stop people Auto attacking you to death but it's more about not only learning that micro and trading patterns and laning matchups and things like that and also about how to influence the map with your ultimate and still not lose Lane at the same time it is something that takes a lot of time to balance perfectly much like farming and ganking in the jungle then also has a much better time in most Lanes than people give him credit for they underestimate his damage up but we always know that from the expat of videos he's a fantastic super Pusher and duelist himself despite only really being known for his Global contributions so learning limits and matchups learning damage trading patterns and learning how to play macro will basically make you the best top laner in the game and loved by adc's mispositioning everywhere and you know despite balances going in and out and sometimes the champion being good or bad if you want to play Darius in any single rank you can do so and he's had a fantastic time ever since the durability patch halfway through last season and still with no nose it's safe to say he's pretty safe to pick in the Top Lane without really worth worrying about right coming for him while he does have his capability issues and certain problems getting onto people and obviously he doesn't always have the best matchups permanently he has huge amounts of 1v9 potential and now that he can basically Go flash ghost every game without being punished for not taking TP it's much easier to scale into those team fights better to win their Top Lane harder to move that into jungle invasions Herald control Dragon rotations his fantastic laning strengths with solid only game damage at level 6 power Spike Lee damage healing 1v2 potential sustain and burst and obviously when you're fed those pen to kill possibilities he is a complete monster very hard to shut down and a good Darius will understand the bad matchups he will understand the good matchups and he knows how to play aggressively to take over games himself next up is Owen and as you all know one of my favorite Champions and when I play in the jungle instead because again I'm crazy he's one of the most fun tanks to play in the game with a huge skill ceiling long range engage a lot of CC a lot of damage a lot of resistances and he upgrades his team so that even when they're behind you know they're not really behind and if you can win fight it's when you're behind with that kind of company you start upgrading people as own basically GG every game additionally he has some funky combos where you can get like three four knock-ups in a row especially when you have other teammates you can also knock out then you can kind of do more even especially when you're hitting that q1 pulling R1 eating them and then ring them again and then of course you've got brother procs on the w and of course the auto attacks after the ultimate a lot of fun things you can do you can impact games from 1v1 and winning Top Lane through great lighting you can weak side if you want to and just scale for a team fights he can run to his mid lane with the ultimate or the dragon fights TB back Top Lane there's not much he can't do to influence games early and often and there's not much you can't do once you get into the late game and you gig a scale if you enjoy Real tanky Frontline disruption playstyle engage and peeling and love helping your team as much as possible while also having the ability to 1v1 people on love Island you cannot go wrong with own and he's handsome finally we have the good Champion the champion that has a choke assault and her kit does true damage has Shield amazing Mobility lockdown ultimate and of course did I mention true damage plus Shields that's Camille she's looking spicy she's looking strong as she always does a lot of her counter picks are not as strong as they have been they've been nerfed and she was already in a fantastic spot and has been for a long time actually so any newer players of the last few years know how meta resistant she can be he'll find a way to be relevant and even when you're losing Lane right you have long range engage and lockdown that can always be useful what she offers in Top Lane is strong trading power with her passive and her Q she has sustain she has flows with her W she has amazing Mobility with an E again to disengage or engage and she doesn't even really need to take flash anymore she can take ignite this means that as soon as you reach those Break Even points once you learn the damage output whoever's fed on the enemy team you can usually lock them down ignite them and kill them by yourself on top of this there are loads of cool things she can do in her kid with regards to angles and combos especially with that e so that skill ceiling and skill expression really rewards those who put in the time and that's obviously something we've been driving home with this video plenty of Combos and tips and tricks that you can Master to get A Step Above the Rest even encounter matchups if you're a diamond and platinum and gold then you must the Camille you can win every relating every game through your own skill issue Camino truly is a champion that will only get more rewarding the more you play her much like a lot of the top laners and she's been really super strong in High ELO ever since her release and mostly hated by other top laners and basically everyone in the game and with that my voice is a little bit torched don't forget the mobletics companion guide says all of these tips for counters and how to play them in the live companion don't forget I'm for Kai you can head over for Jungle tips and tricks on my main Channel which will be linked below thank you very much for watching and as always we will see you all in the next tutorial ","60":"for those of you complaining about Champions and League of Legends do you want to know who the most broken Champs are going to be for each role in 13.3 well who doesn't because guys if you're not playing these champions in your roles like you're not actually going to get better as a player but yeah playing these Champions they are the most broken and they might increase your win rate by a little bit you might go on a bit of a straight climb a little bit of LP you know but what's really actually going to help you is improving as a player right and that's what we can teach you on the website gameweep.com description comment section I myself have coached every World a challenger to rank one of you West in fact off coach rank one players in different regions so if you actually do want to know like what challenge your players do and think that's different to you sign up we're uploading daily videos and if you don't improve like I'll just be amazed because we have thousands of Summoners relishing and actually climbing from watching our videos so yeah you guys can do the same get that exclusive access by signing up and yeah let's get into the three most broken for 13.3 we're gonna start in the Top Lane now coming into number three is the most banned for player in the game this is Fiora now who was played against Grass for your with manaflow band and then Scorch like if you guys haven't clinched your fist before or done a bit of damage to your environment around you like you're going to do something and choose violence when you play against figurative it is the most frustrating experience in the game legit she does so much damage in the early game despite being a mid to late game scaling champion and even though those Nerfs came in recently like to what her vital damage and also to accuse damage like the scaling off your attack damage it doesn't do anything because Fiora is still going to get to the midsole again she still has really good scaling it's just like the early laning fix like actual inlight how'd you beat a fiori like what Champions do you have to pick maybe what like Quinn a bit of Cannon maybe Jace like range Champions any melee Champion you do super well into so Fiora is number three coming in at number two is actually one of those range Championship probably dumpsters for your she does pretty well but this is Jace so for Jason 13.3 because of those Buffs recently and also the bus to eclipse the actual ability is it's made you even better like if you guys are not going to play this champion in this current patch 13.1 B please play him in 13.3 guys just abuse him while you can now yes he might not have the best win rates but we're talking about laning phase here yeah if you see a Jace locked in on the enemy team you know that you're gonna have a hard time of it unless you're like a one-trick movie Wukong or something like this but every lane you can easily win his Chase so he's number two now number one Speaking of lanes you can easily win the best store planet for 13.3 is going to be Jax as long as you ban Jace you should be sweet now gragas might do well as well into Jax because you can stop his Q right and you can build an early Frozen Heart it really tucks the champion but even still like Jax is one of those Champions where you can take grasp or lethal temper depending on the matchup a bit like for Europe and it's super frustrating to play against also the recent changes to Jax where that extra damage is blocking off every two Auto attacks when you hit Level 6 it's just way too op also your ultimate making you better in team fights now like the champion is just way too good and that's illustrated by his win Race Across like every single Lilo is an S Plus 2 champion and the number one now heading into the jungle guys unfortunately I've just got three AP Champions so yes no attack damage Champions here and honestly I think this is just the truth so if you're playing Echo if you're playing maokai if you're playing Evelyn these are the three strongest jungles right now now we might not see Evelyn in Pro play and not echo of course you know there'll be other jungles like Wukong and VI I could have included maybe then but honestly speaking like just looking at the stats Echo has to be number three and I guess it's kind of the reason why Evelyn is also really good the jungle changes where they made krugs a lot easier to take and lots of people now just full clearing because again if you guys remember it's harder to take the enemies camps so these full clearas and weak early game junglers are almost protected by those changes Echo and Evelyn are two of them so these really help and they've both been buffed recently as well and mauka is the other one even though he got Nerf last patch and demonic Embrace got Nerf for him well because he's still incredibly powerful like his win rate is legit 53 I don't know how that even works but it is and for some reason the balance team aren't nerfing him in 13.3 I mean it is the balance team you know so I guess that's kind of standard but yeah Echo maokai and Evelyn are the three best junglers now heading into the mid lane here I've actually got two attack damage mid laners that would be really good if you do have one of those jungles on your team so Echo maokai everyone now the first of these is Pantheon now I know when I'll tell this video in the 15 most broken Champions video I did not mention Pantheon but I think these changes are going to go through the freak detailed in his video so the changes are as follows you're getting a bit more attack speed okay your Q's cooldown is decreasing by two seconds to one second and also the q's Mana cost is going down as well now in the mid lane right even at the moment Pantheon is actually just like slaying people he just so well against like the popular picks so if we think of Yasuo Katarina Zed all these close range Champions Silas he would absolutely destroy Jonah he'd do very well against so he's an absolute Powerhouse in the mid lane against the popular pissed but also guys if we think about eclipse the extra ability hates this gives you that means more cues and your Q's cooldown next patch is going down also for your grab Sky full ride it's super useful to get more ultimates off also maybe a tip for Pantheon when you hit Level 6 try to get a recall off ASAP and run to a lane that's important and get three kills without showing on the map and if we also take into consideration hit the Black Cleaver buff more attack damage more HP this is just unreal for Pat like this is going to be the best pattern probably like in history like I'm being serious so Pantheon is number three I could have even put him a bit higher on this list number two is going to be casting so kassadin was number one the last few patches just number two here reason being is because he's getting nerves again your ease damage your ease cooldown the refresh and also your ultimate stacking these are all getting nerfed right the actual damage I guess in your ultimate and therefore the second so this means castling will be a little bit weaker but notice that I said a little bit weaker he's not gonna be like just so useless he's still gonna be a very good champion and with Rod of Ages still good Sarah's Embrace still very good he's still gonna be the king of the AP build ladies now the number one mid laner guy so if he's the king of the AP mid laners Castleton who's the king of the attack damage mid laners this is Tristana this has been picking up a lot more play recently in popularity because she's actually being picked in Pro play and even in high reelers right people are playing Tristana a lot more she does very well into a lot of Mages and well into anyone honestly like if you're running something like Halo Blazers or Keystone and with the infinity edge buff recently right where it's broken your 40 crit crack and Slayer into IE into light collector oh my goodness like you will be one shorting every single Champion you have to play really precisely as well against Tristana so it's super easy to punish the enemy Champion's mistakes so again if you're in like lower elos I'll probably say anything like mastering below you are going to absolutely Stomp the mid lane so Tristana is the number one now moving down to the Port Lane guys and if you are enjoying our season 13 content make sure you let us know by leaving a like down below and coming in at number three we have gin now if you're playing gin with gale force in videos rapid fire can whatever it is you're building you're going like crit kind of attack speed based gin I guess what I want you us to consider going is lethality gin now the only issue with this is that well if you're like one of the few attack damage Champions on your team you should probably go get all Force an infinity edge Because the actual like output you deal like in terms of damage will be higher right but if you're going with thality you'll be dealing so much damage to those squishy Champions and with the new Eclipse giving you ability Haze you will legit one short people it's actually just a really underrated setup there is some tech around like rushing a ghostblade and then getting eclipsed but yeah the gist of this is that lethality gin is back and yeah his win rates across every single Layla like pretty much all these Champions is super good so Jin's number three now number two a champion who well doesn't actually do two well into Jin but we'll probably have a free Lane regardless because he's so broken this is Draven and just like gin if you're going the new Eclipse now Draven probably does actually appreciate omnivamp because they removed it right from Eclipse more than ability Heist but still the item is giving you the lethality you kind of want and it's also giving you amazing armor penetration if we also pair this with Essence Reaver which is what you should be doing so get a dirk into Essence Reaper into eclipse from the Dirk right and because it's giving you more attack damage Essence River that is that's what you care about the most important set for Draven and yeah he's number two to on this countdown I'm sure we can all agree on that now number one the best ad carry is Caitlyn we're going to see her guys picked in Pro play a lot when this patch actually drops well from the infinity edge changes anyway because it speeds up her scaling right go Force into Infinity Edge you crush everyone not only are you pretty much impossible to beat during the landing phase because of that range and also the lethal Tempo stacking if you're playing against close range ball lens Fleet footwork makes you very difficult to actually even poke Adeline if the enemy Champions even have poke and can touch you in the first place and yes with that Infinity Edge change it's really pushed Caitlyn into op territory and she is clearly the number one ID carry for 13.3 now the best support all of these supports guys are actually like engage support oh my goodness finally a bit of change I'm not going to talk about Nami or Lulu or Janna so praise someone the balance team freak there we go we'll praise freak so number three is umu amumu is getting nerfed in 13.3 you'd be correct your Q's Mana course is going up and also your ease damage is going down until rank five okay but here's the thing for a movie with Glacier Soul augment you're still going to easily be able to get two cues off as well and your ease damage will still be good enough to kill the enemy bot Lane when you land a queue the champion I just think having two charges of bandage toss especially against the mobile bauntlets it's too good and I don't think there are any other Champions who are better than him than the top two here number two speaking of this is Ricard and the changes to Recon guys in 13.3 well they're not really like that big honestly but if you are going shirelliers you will make use of some of these so your W AP ratio is going up and because you're getting ability power from shirellis you will actually be able to deal do some damage in the mid to their game with this and also for your Q well the damage is actually going up in the early game and also the heel is going up at every level and it's actually going up close to a hundred when you have five points in it this is huge this will actually probably encourage you to Max your Q seconds so w first then your Q right so this is really nice for rakat and I think these changes are going to push him into broken territory someone even commented on our top 15 Champions video the Recon I'm surprised he's not on this list well there you go bro he is number two for the support but beating these guys to number one in the bot Lane if you want to play a support and 1v9 your games blitzcrank has to be the answer guys when you're running close to a log when it kind of just like a Mumu I guess but yeah blitzcrank your Q is gaining 100 damage at level one also your ultimate because they buffed that towards the end of last season that damage has actually just completely unchanged and blitzkraine does so well into pretty much every support unless you say like maybe a Leona or a Braum who's getting above maybe a Tariq but these aren't really like that popular the popular supports you're going to see all those enchantresses you crush them and Bliss ranks win rate just like every other Champion it justifies me putting in the number one because yeah in every single ELO he performs extremely well so definitely consider having Blitz into a champion poor guys and those were the three most broken chances of each role in patch 13.3 any questions any comments leave them in the comment section down below and until our next season 13 upload this has been eggs peace foreign ","61":"what's going on game weepers we talked about in our last video the 13.6 changes mate it's time for another macca's run and we're going to be bringing you the 10 best Champions based on these changes for 13.6 guess what you're still gonna be hard suck though like I've said this in so many videos so you know what you have to do sign up to the game with website so I can actually teach you the fundamentals of the game so it doesn't matter what happens to the matter like do you think that Faker is gonna fall out of Challenger and fall out of being like the best player of all time let's say if Teemo becomes like the best mid laner to play or maybe a champion like blitzcrank becomes the best mid lane champion of course not right because it doesn't matter it's how you play not who we can teach you how to play sign up to the website like you can climb divisions and tears all you have to do is just ask yourself do you want it bad enough scroll down description comment session click on gamelap.com sign up but yeah let's get into the top 10 Champions guys for 13.6 now we're going to start by talking about well a couple of Champions getting changed in 13.6 two of these being Vain and Taiwan now for Bane I don't know if you guys watched our video yesterday if you you haven't where we talk about the changes make sure you check that out but for vain in the Top Lane oh my goodness me if she's not like banned in every single game like if you're I don't even care like who you play in the Top Lane if you're a top laner ban vain the passive movement speech he's getting is going up by 50 the cue's attack damage ratio is going up as well makes her late game even better early game she'll still feel this too the cube of duration even though it's going down by a lot who cares because after uq you're probably Auto attacking straight away anyway and her W's percentage HP damage is increasing at rank 1 she doesn't even need to Max this first and she's benefiting from this if these Buffs go through like they will just make her Beyond broken and they will break the Top Lane Ben vein in every single game she's gonna be that broken and that's why she's starting off this countdown now another champion I just mentioned Talon right in the mid lane now they're not the biggest boss in the world but I mentioned yesterday how like when a champion gets base damages buffed so Talon's passive damage is increasing also his ultimate damage is increasing at level 11 and 16 or Rank 2 in rank 3 right this means for Talon you don't always have to go like Fuller mortality so if you're going something like ghost play proud was cool or like dust blade and Edge unite and you know axiomark serpents Bank these just like full lethality builds and because there's no real like defense here you're just like a full glass Cannon right but because of these changes they actually mean that you can probably afford to go something like Eclipse like Cleaver opens up of course you still want to go maybe something like coastblade right but they open up other items that protect you they still give you like good damage like a close for example is still building out of a serrated Dirk but the passes for the movement Speed The Shield they just make you less killable while still dealing enough damage to kill those swishy targets the base man are going up for Talon as well is really nice and the W matter cost decreasing these are huge like mid lane Talon I actually think he'll be op and picked a band a heck of a lot more in 13.6 now staying in the mid lane here one Champion getting nerfed in 13.6 is a really in Soul there your R1 and R2 range might be getting nerfed yo he's cooldown might be going to apply 12 seconds the Stardust required for your Ultimate Upgrade might be increasing as well the stunt duration and knock-up duration they might be going down on your R1 and R2 but do these really mean that much for a champion who has like a 53 winner every single rank probably not a day like I think his win rate of course is going to go down by a little bit here but it'll still be really op Rod of Ages you know Riley's Crystal SEPTA these items are staying the same they're not getting hit at all so 13.6 aurelian Seoul it will be worse but he's so good anyway that it'll still be really good next passion there's no reason to stop playing him and yeah probably Banning him as well now moving into the jungle Jarvan probably the best jungle ride I think we can all agree statistically as well kind of backs it up you know conqueror the recent busts to his W ride actually making it a really good ability they even had to Nerf it that's how good it's been but yeah j4 super versatile jungler is easily the best at the moment and in 13.6 nothing is really changing for him so that's why he's in this video now there are a few other Champions guys who are going to be affected by the changes in 13.6 the first of these is Echo now the reason Echo is here because of the Nash's tooth change right so it's going up to 3 200 gold to a 200 gold increase now for Echo this sounds kind of bad right but guess what you're getting 15 ability hits okay now for Echo ability heads is really nice yeah and with Nash's two barrels for your clear speed your DPS your passive ride it's actually like a really underrated item so if you're going to something like rocket build into nashes and designers or something like this it's kind of like an insane setup an echo at the moment is really good without this buff like he does not need this he's a super good Champion according to the statues like S Plus steering pretty much every single ELO so echo in 13.6 is going to be very scary and deep now moving down to the bot Lane here guys there are two ad carries who I think are still going to be broken in 13.6 and one of them you can probably guess who this is gonna be Zaya now for Zaya for sure leedsville Tempo is getting Nerf right and this is for any Champion going lethal Tempo by the way if you're a range Champion so lethal Tempo getting enough less attack speed and the max attack speed is now going to proc at level 18 right so this does affect you at every seizure game also novori quickblades is getting nerfed so the actual cool down reduction you get on your basic abilities is going down now to 12 rather than staying at 15 this effects are but can we really like put her off this countdown when she's so good at the moment it's kind of like the aurelian soul Theory right they're so broken at the moment that even if they get hit just a little bit they're still going to be broken anyway so that's why Zaya is here and this is exactly the same bizarry as well and I know you guys are thinking oh but series not OP you know like silver gold n a ELO bro I don't care look at how zerry has played in the highest of elos if you change those like filters to challenge her in Korea she has like a 55 win rate that's healthier that's really really healthy for the game this Champion being able to space Glide around the map like she was back in the day like I don't think there's a more annoying Champion to play against in fact a Roman Soul might come close to actually rivaling her here but Siri with no very quick plays we've run on tarakane have mentioned this build in recent videos because so many champions are just gonna be like Close Quarters these days because the better and the bot Lane is more about engaging these days as well Zoe is just going to prosper and even though lethal Tempo is getting another very quick players is getting enough they're not enough to bring this champion in line with other Champs in the game now staying at the bot Lane guys one of those champers I talked about Yumi and I don't want to talk about it that much hey like please just banner I don't care bro let Banner get rid of it make this Champion get removed the balance team is gonna have no choice guys like if we ban all right as a community she's going to be close to like 100 band right and guess what she'll get removed in the game like who is not gonna Rejoice at that this Champion is just complete AIDS untargetable nowadays she makes her best friend like unkillable the targeted ultimate like just get me out whoever made this Champion like like it makes the jizz's blood boil seriously so Yumi even though she is like the most hated champion in the game well one of the reasons why is because she's so broken right now she's gonna be broken in 13.6 I didn't even care if she's getting nerved in fact I'm going to put her on every single top Champions video I make in the future until she gets removed from the game trust me now the other support guys I've mentioned here is Annie in 13.6 I'm kind of surprised as well because Addie is not getting nerfed the e-max Annie has a support is still the way to go and because Annie you know because of all the changes at the start of the Season she's just still super broken she still has like over a 53 win rate in pretty much every single ELO as a support maybe there are some Champions who do very well against shirai so Reigns Champions we might be talking Zara for Lux velcos uh Santa might be good right but because of matter at the moment lots of engaged Champions are getting picked and he loves it and he loves teams who are going to run into it because you can get multiple you know like kind of AOE Tibbers off with the sun of course and yeah because of the stun you can stand engaging Champion disengage or you can just keep the fight going because you deal so much damage anyway so any support is also in this countdown now the final Champion guys to talk about we're going to the Top Lane here this is a champion who vane will still Crush but it's still going to be really good enably speaking this being Jax nothing is really changing in 13.6 the lethal Tempo Nerf is for range Champion so you kind of just like Dodge this and the helicopter will still be really op in 13.6 whether you're a go like divides sunderer into bork or Shoguns on yours hourglass the recent changes to Jacks that were meant to be Nerfs you know just looking High realize for me it still has like a 53 win rate he's pretty much picked and banned still his counters so gragas and Jace I mean they are actually like pretty good counters but still even they aren't strong enough to keep this champion from being super op so if you're a top laner guys and you're picking or Banning Jacks you should probably do the same in 13.6 as well and those were the top 10 champions of course these are predicted these are forecasts but yeah I am the profit bro profit jizz but yeah thank you for watching guys please leave a like down below if you did enjoy it any comments again leave them in the comment section and I will see you when I season 13 upload disabilities peace foreign ","62":"oh what's up game weepers it's the jizz and in today's video three most broken champions for each role for 13.6 and Well Done by the way for clicking on another macca's video this one is going to help you improve Kappa but you're still going to be the same ELO yeah after watching this 10 minute video but if you actually do want to climb divisions and tears gameweep.com the website in the description comment section like I can teach you everything there is bro back time in wave management positioning even little things like itemization Rune optimizations right even your spacing how you're using abilities like everything in the game that really matters like I can help you improve and it doesn't matter what Champion you pick in your role you can pick Teemo support for all I care you will 1v9 based on the teachings in our website video so check out the website link down below and yeah let's get into the three most broken Champions the e-troll for next patch now starting in the top plane number three we have malphite now because the W bus really recently to malphite they've actually made him like a really busted Champion honestly like in pretty much every single ELO this guy performs well even though he does have some like pretty hard counters like in high reloads ride if you blind pick male fight you will be running into like a lot of AEP Champions because you're picking email but really just to like  the attack damage Champions and attack speed based champions in the Top Lane so it might be something like a Jax it might be something like a tournament for example because you can build Frozen hardest part of your items but even without this because of your e the attack speed reduction is just so powerful and because of the recent Buffs yesterday or w pair this with a frostbite Gauntlet you one short people with auto attacks now like it's a little bit cooked to play against but yeah malphite is number three just be a little bit careful about blind picking it because yeah you will run into some good AP champions in the Top Lane now number two speaking of one of those champers who malphar really this is Jack now there are no Nerfs the hockey stick in 13.6 so he's got to be on this countdown as well the champion is still over performing despite his early game getting hit in recent patches you know I mean the fact you have 140 AP ratio in your e and as long as you get a Max E off this will deal insane damage particularly if you go something like zhonya's hourglass as your third or fifth item but yeah no match has really changed for this Champion lethal Tempo getting nerfed I guess like might be some sort of hit in the early game but honestly it probably doesn't matter too much you can still run grassly on dying on this Champion so yeah Jax is number two still an unreal pick in the Top Lane you probably do have to think about banning Json gragas though if you want a nice free Lane now speaking of a free Lane I don't actually know if this Champion is going to have any counters in the Top Lane but Vain and 13.6 if the changes do go through like the Buffs are like some of the biggest Buffs I've ever seen if they do go through this Champion is just going to be the outright number one top Lane and maybe even champion on the rift because the Buffs are huge right your passive movement speed is going up 50 your Q's damage is going up your W's damage is going up at earlier ranks and this means that you don't actually have to Max this first you can Max something like your Q first and yeah it's just vain Top Lane like she's an amazing counter into so many things and some people as well might think you're going like you know 80 carry vein next minute you send it to the Top Lane and dominate whichever melee Champion even range Champion Savannah is number one guys in the Top Lane for 13.6 now moving into the jungle these two Champions are largely unchangeable they kind of are unchanged because for j4 and Lee soon if you're running conqueror right and you're going like eclipse or Gore Drinker maybe into some games right these two Champions are just like cream of the cop as far as attack damage jungles go they are easily the best right now and that's what what we're seeing a lot in Pro play as well at the moment so if you look like the lck which is playing on 13.5 well 13.6 remember nothing is changing for these two Champions so they're still going to be insanely strong just be a little bit careful about maybe blind picking j4 because lots of Champions do cut you so stuff like thresh support because he can flare you out of your EQ even something like a Zaire is really good against j4 so there are other like Champions you have to worry about right when you're picking j4 like Top Lane you have to think about mid lane and all that stuff you can't just lock him in but at least in UK like you're such a versatile champion and I think he's just a little bit better than j4 for that reason but those are number three and number two for the jungle and the number one jungler isn't a p Champion who's going to benefit from the Nash's tooth buff coming in in 13.6 well it's not really a buff it's actually more of just like an adjustment so the actual cost for Nash's is going up 3 200 gold that's 200 gold extra than what it is right now you're getting 15 ability heads but Champion like Echo who really appreciates ability haste this is a great buff for him and because he's so good anyway at the moment I think this is just going to push him into a really OB territory so he is the number one jungler for 13.6 obviously trying to think of what your team comp is going to look like if you have a lot of magic damage already probably don't lock this guy in but if you compare this with like a Renekton Top some sort of attack damage mid laner like an irelia for instance Echo you will pop off and have a field day now moving to the mid lane speaking of the mid lane number three we have talent who is getting buffed in 13.6 and I know that Talent isn't the most amazing mid laner at the moment but he will be in 13.6 because his base matter is increasing and his W's Mana cost is also decreasing this means that as far as your wave clear and actually you know cesing and poking the enemy Champion you can just do more of everything in the early Landing base which is when you are actually vulnerable but what's also changing for talent is your passive damage is getting buffed so a little bit in the early game put a load in the late game and your ultimate damage is increasing from Rank 2 to level 11 onwards including level 16 of course right so these two damage Buffs I think are going to be really good because when you do hit the mid to late game you can one shot a lot of people this means I think especially the passive buff right for good Talon players who can proc this pretty much all the time it's going to be massive and I think Talon in the mid lane is going to be really good you probably just have to be a little bit careful about picking Talon into maybe what just blind picking him I guess because you might have to be careful about playing into something like maybe a LeBlanc something like this right might be an annoying Lane for you even irelia might be another one right so do be a little bit careful with that but the Talon Buffs I think they're gonna make him really good that's why he's number three now number two a champion who is surprisingly just like unchanged for next patch and I am surprised by this because Annie as a support anyway is really good right but in the mid lane she's still very strong indeed the actual e that gives you movement speed and if your jungler is ganking you can use it on tippers of course you can even use it on yourself to get close to the enemy mid laner now she does get cucked by range Champions okay and I don't just mean like you know any range Champion I'm really talking about long range Champions so these might include velcourse a bit of xerath right but a syndra orianna maybe because as difficult as any to run into them Annie is all about close range okay so if you do see a lot of range on the enemy team Veigar is another one by the way be very careful about picking Annie into a vegar team they will destroy you and you will feel like you can't do anything you can't even touch the enemy Champions now of course in Solo Q riding and mostly those people won't be playing at that range they'll get their spacing all wrong if you don't to maximize your spacing and actually space perfectly sign up to the game we website for all those videos that we're doing but yeah Annie is number two she's still a very good champion and you can pick her anyway it shouldn't matter too much but yeah just thought I'd give you guys those tips now number one mid lane we've already mentioned her so if you have Echo jungle think about picking irelia in the mid lane this champion because well there are like no real nurse to her in 13.6 it's just going to be Giga ROP especially if you can pick irelia into some sort of like a magic damage mid and jungle kind of Duo so let's just say you're playing against an echo and any Mage mid laner right with ap you can get merch shreds you can get where it's end you can get Shield bow you will be unkillable bro like it doesn't matter even how bad you are at irelia like I'm sure we've all experienced it right irelia like they'll miss their ultimate their e all they do is just Q to you and auto attack you and you die anyway so I think the champion yeshi has a massive High skill sailing right like if you watch someone like a real king you will see the full potential of this Champion but even just for like kind of novice you know beginner Aurelia players I really think this Champion is just exploitable and abusable for free LP at the moment so she is the number one mid laner and if you do actually want to learn the champion of course once again sign up to the website to do just that now moving down to the bot Lane here guys the number 380 carry well there are lots of changes to the 80 carry roll and 13.6 but thank lethal Tempo is getting nerfed in the early game it's important for lethal Tempo 80 carrots also novory quick blades is getting nerfed so this will affect Champions like Zaya for instance Zary Kaiser as well right other not very quick blade 80 carries but for Zai despite the tempo notes despite the quick blade nerves I don't think they're going to be enough to stop the shampoo from being a top to ready carry because of the bot Lane at the moment and even the game in a way is very close range if you think like a malphite right we had him in the Top Lane if you think about jungle we had Lee sin and j4 in the mid lane we have Talon Annie irelia azaya all you have to do is press your roll and you completely cuck and destroy all of these Champions right in the bot Lane as well we're seeing a lot of Nautilus we're saying thresh quite a bit Zaya does very well into these champions again because you just press r i mean Therese is a little bit more risky but yeah you do so well in The Meta right now so Zyra is number three now speaking of meta a champion who is getting nerfed because he's so good but he will still be so good in 13.6 is very figure that your base HP is going down your base armor is going down and yes this is AP carry bagar in the bot Lane but the thing here is like do you think you really need armor or even like HP at the moment given the fact you can just farm from a super far way back and not get hit by anything like the bus to its q and W's range a few patches ago mean that Veigar is just kind of chilling until like what you get rower or maybe you get like some sort of everfrost build depending on the enemy composition right you just get the scale for free now that's what I think anyway like in pretty much every single game and he's so effective against so many champions like he's such a big cuck so if you see an enemy bot Lane right where they have a lot of close range you can just pick this Champion even if the enemy team has a lot of close range and you don't know who you're against in the bomb Lane you can still pick this guy and just pop off so baby Gandalf is number two for the bot Lane the number one ad carry guards for 13.6 is going to continue to beat Jinx lethal Tempo is getting Nerf a big deal it's gonna hit everyone and honestly it's not like the biggest thing in the world and it's Jinx getting to the late game is so easy now because of the recent Busters especially the attack speed buffer right that has been huge and I think you can just blind pick her she does very well and desire for example because you just outrange and out push her with your fish bones but yeah I'll just say this guy's about playing Jinx please try to be in Lane to get priority you do not want to be playing Jinx like just sitting on your Tower getting fisted you want to be playing with priority she is actually like a good aggressive 80 carry if you can play like that so do keep that in mind but Jinx is the number 180 carry all next patch now alongside ad carries we have the support now third support number three this is Annie we've already mentioned Annie in the mid lane and kind of the same reason I guess for the bot Lane as well right as playing support addy is that you do so well into so many close range Champions your e now the fact yeah you can like movement speed buff one of your teammates should already carry your jungle who's gonna gank even yourself to stun the enemy Champions and yeah because of the upgraded tippers as well who's unkillable subscribe for Tower Dives your flash alt as well with your stun is very scary right so any in the bot Lane great pick very good into the matter as well like Lords of these Champions now the second best support is blitzcrank this Champion like I don't know why he isn't even picked more like his kid is just set up perfectly to cut so many supports if you see a thresh right if you see an enchantress if you see maybe even an Annie who you might might be able to blow up before she even does anything once you hit Level six right might be a little bit risky picking blitzcrank into Annie but hopefully you guys catch my drift here this Champion has such a good win rate in every single ELO who's like an S Plus to his support so consider putting blitzcrank guys in your pool for 13.6 and the number one support now I know I started a petition yesterday right now copped a bit of flat okay because there are some people out there who enjoy playing Yumi but if you're playing against Yumi you're gonna want to commit it's not a fun experience it's not enjoyable it's not you know and what we play league for to play against a champion you can't hit of course you can pick something like blitzcrank into a ride or Nautilus and you hook the ad carry who she's sitting on top of but even though she's getting nerfed in 13.6 I still think this Champion is just beyond busted because of the recent changes and you guys can let me know in the comment section if you do actually think she's op sensor changes and yeah leave your thoughts on any of the Champions we mentioned guys maybe there's a champion who you think is actually more broken than any of these let us know who that champion is in the comment section but thank you so much for watching please leave a like down below if you did enjoy it and until our next season 13 upload the spinach peace foreign ","63":"game leapers this is part two mate to the 13.10 changes that have been released on Twitter and they're all over Reddit the League of Legends Community just pop it off made because of their changes so what are the rest of the changes here we're going to be getting into the Top Lane changes to Bruiser changes and there will be a couple of other changes in terms of the system changes we will get into in this video so the rest of them the ones we detailed in part one I'd highly recommend checking that out if you haven't already the ones we haven't actually detailed we will talk about them in today's video so make sure you stick around for the whole thing so you know exactly what changes are going to hit the Riff in 13.10 and yeah if you do enjoy the video please remember to leave a like down below but if you do actually want to improve the game these changes like won't do it for you by the way so what you have to do is improve yourself yeah as a player so what you can do is just sign up to the game with website you can get access to our exclusive library of content that our Challenger players and coaches add to on The Daily and these might be like Champion courses they might be Champion guys macro guides regarding every single role and champion in the game so you can take your game on the roof to the next level check out those links down below and get signed up now let's get into the rest of the changes so first of all let's talk about the Bruiser items in the Top Lane now first of all we have the fighter items getting buffed so for Gore drinking you're getting an extra 25 from the Mythic passive for stride break you're getting more attack damage and for whole break you're getting more attack damage and movement speed honestly these changes I don't really seem that good especially compared to like the ad carry items we talked about in part one seems like pretty lazy from the balance team I don't know if they actually have like Top Lane people on there but yeah compared to the 80 carry changes this could have been done in like five minutes and feels like it and yeah the other changes here we have Trinity Force which is also getting changed so for Trinity Falls for 200 less gold you're getting five more attack damage and five percent more attack speed now as for divine Sunder exactly the same like stats so attack damage health and ability haste that's all staying the same but the actual attack from the spellboy passive is dealing 160 base damage here and you're also going to heal the 55 of the pre-mitigation damage the Mythic passive is staying the same now as far as the other Bruiser items go in the Top Lane we have stereo schedule which is basically just giving you tenacity again so they've kind of just like reverted the item now as far as the changes go to force in nature this is increasing in Gold by 100 to 3000 and you're getting a bit more HP but you're losing a little bit of magic resist and as for the absorb passive you need more Stacks from this so you need 10 Stacks now to actually be able to participate so while the 10 Stacks is steadfast this is going to practice a pay which means you're getting 30 magic resist and then 10 increase movement speed now as for a pistol mask guys well this might actually not be a Top Lane either because this is going to be more of a support based item so taking it from the Top Lane into the support role it's costing 2400 gold giving you 300 HP 60 magic resistant 10 ability has and the unmake passive from this you curse nearby enemy Champions and therefore you reduce their magic resist now for each cursed enemy you gain magic resist so this might be really good even if you have something like an AP bot laner like you might have carthus or Swain in the bottling and you're playing one of those tankier supports I think this could be actually really good in certain situations now other items in 13.10 changing up guys first of all we have bloodthirster costing 3200 gold 55 attack damage 20 crit 18 life still and the engorge passive while above 50 HP you gain an additional amount of attack damage based on level now moving on we have runine's hurricane which is also getting changed based off the recover changes so recover 15 attack speed and you're getting magic damage on here this is also costing 700 gold now and yes roon on Hurricane costing 2800 gold 40 attack speed 20 credit seven percent movement speed you're getting a peck passive that's what it's called attack supplies 30 magic damage on hit and wins Fury when attacking bolts fired up to two enemies near the target pretty much still the same in that regard now we also have collector getting changed so 55 attack damage still costing 3 000 gold 20 crit 18 lethality and the death and taxes passive dealing damage that would leave an enemy Champion below 5 Health execute them Champion kills Grant an additional 25 gold and to be honest I don't know why the balance team classified this as an assassin item because it's not it's an 80 carry item that's just the balance thing for you they are on that good kush now moving on we have zero guys so it's getting Nerf so I don't know if this is because PC Zhang buys a Zeal on Yasuo and just sits on it for like three items but this Zeal Nerf attack speed down by three percent the movement speed is down by four percent as well also maybe Garen might be hit by this too unlucky guys now a fan of dancer is getting changed guys attack speed is up and the new build path is building out of half pound ax which is costing 800 gold now a Zeal and long sword costing 2800 gold in total now we've got four more items here guys to talk about and these are all in the support role first of all we have radian and virtue so for radiant virtue and 13.10 2700 gold 350 HP 30 armor 30 magic resist 10 ability has and The Guiding Light passive upon casting your ultimate you transcend of course increasing your max HP now while you're transcending you and allies within a certain amount of range you heal for 10 of your max HP over the duration and it grants all other legendary items 75 hp now now moving on to Moonstone renewer this is getting changed 35 ability power 200 hp 20 ability case and a lot of money region and the Starlight Gray's passive healing or shielding and Ally chains to the nearest Ally Champion including yourself of course healing or shielding of the original amount and the Mythic passive is granting ability haste now the final two support items here guys unlock it of the iron solarion Evan shroud are now building out of a null magic mantle but also the life world pendant that we detailed in the previous video which is basically the component item for the Tanki support Champions and items so those are the item changes guys for part two of our little 13.10 update I guess now as far as the other system changes go this is going to be really interesting so as far as minions go except for the first spawn of minions mid lane minions will meet at the same time as side Lanes so in other words Side Lane minions are getting sped up So at around 130 minions are actually going to be near the middle of the lanes now and also here minister of targeted enemy Tower we'll ignore cool for help signals to Target enemy Champions so whether this means like if an enemy Champion Auto attacks you under their Tower and they draw Minion aggro for it this might actually change diving enemy Champions now not actually sure if this change is legit but it is listed here now unleash teleporters also getting changed guys so the upgrade time is now at 10 minutes not 14 minutes this is good for those Champions who yeah just won a team fight I guess and be part of a team rather than you know just the one-on-one aspect of the game now we have turrets here as well play Rush down resistances these are actually increasing so Towers will be harder to take down now we have home guards here as well so the normal Home Guard start time is going from 20 minutes to 14 minutes so you can get out of Base quicker you can defend your stuff so this means in terms of snowballing if you're the winning team we've got to take into account that these enemy Champions are running out of Base quicker then we have the fountain as well so when you're in base your Mana regen is going up and then finally guys we have jungle plants blast cones over the river walls so bot Lane they're the bot dry brush and Top Lane near the top China version the actual initial respawn here is going to be a lot later so as far as you junglers go this means there's less opportunity to gank bombing and it just makes bot Lane a little bit safer in the early game but yeah when it comes to like nine minutes for the blast cone and 10 minutes for unleash teleport watch out for that so those guys were the changes we know so far for 13.10 there is a lot of them let me know in the comment section please what your thoughts are I'm super interested to know who you main if you think your Champion's gonna go like a different item build now maybe please let us know down below thank you so much for watching the video please remember to leave a like as well and until our next 13.9 or 13.10 I didn't even know what next patch is going to be but yeah until that video thank you so much for watching the Phoenix peace foreign ","64":"all right game weepers what's going on how many of you guys have actually seen the changes on Twitter for 13.6 because they came out today so if you guys want to know like what Champions what items or runes are getting changed in 13.6 are most likely going to change make sure you stick around for the whole video also guys I just recommend as well checking out the game website link Down Below in the description comment section because I myself and other Challenger players and coaches are uploading daily content for our subscribers and guess what that is actually the real stuff that will help you improve you can watch as many of these Patch videos as you want like we recently did a jungling video right a couple of days ago that's gonna help you 10 times more than a video like this one of course if you do actually enjoy these videos then leave a like down below because this is really just like us updating you know what's changing in regards to the matter but yeah speaking of those changes let's get into the 13.6 notes we have so far now Champion Buffs now perhaps like the biggest set of changes here are coming to Vain so what's happening your passive movement speed where you get movement speed if an enemy Champion is visible on your screen you get an extra 15 movement speed this is kinda cracked because this is going up pretty much 50 and for vain movement speed is such an important stat now also your Q's attack damage ratio is increasing from 60 to 80 is now scaling from 75 all the way to 115 so even in the early game like this is a big percentage increase and you will feel this especially in the late game of course because it's going up 35 now the cube buff duration where you get the enhanced Auto attack this is actually lasting a lot shorter so only three seconds this means you're going to be a bit more precise with your q and you won't be able to just hold on to an impressive the enemy champions in your lane but honestly it's not really the biggest Nerf in the world and they're also changing your W's percentage HP damage so you're probably just going to be maxing your Q first because they're actually increasing this at early ranks and decreasing it at later ranks and in the Top Lane I think this is going to make vane the most broken champion in the game honestly like Top Lane vain more movement speed your Q is going to deal more damage and you'll w at rank 1 is going to be dealing way more damage to those Champions with a lot of HP this is going to be an insane patch for vain that is if these changes do go through any vein Mains any 80 carry Mains let me know in the comment section and what you think of them I just think these are massively over tuned now sticking with the ad carries here the other Champion getting buffed is Ash and Ash recently has copped a lot of changes right because support Ash has been really broken and picked and banned in Pro playwright so the boundless team have given her the treatment but they're actually giving her a good stream in here because they're increasing your passive damage when you're attacking an enemy champion who has frost on them so pretty much when you slow an enemy Champion with your attacks or abilities those Auto attacks you deal to them they're going to be dealing an extra five percent damage now which is actually like kind of big I think this is low-key really good for Ash and AD carry Ash is kind of culture because of the W base damage Nerf ride from last patch I think this will actually make her good again will it make her Opie where we'll have to wait and see Ash means let me know down below what you think now moving to the mid lane so for Talon your base Mana is increasing from 377 to 400 and sticking with the Mana box your W's man of course is going down by five at each rank because you're maxing this first this is your big wave clear in the early game it's pretty much like the only thing that helps you see us against like oppressive range Champions who want to bully you early on this is huge for talent also your passive damage is increasing by five in the early game all the way to 25 in the late game and because your passive is such a big part of your kit this is also massive now also your ultimate damage is increasing from level 11 or Rank 2 and a rank 3 or level 16 as well now the big thing here for Talon of course the base Mana annual Mana costs and your W going down are huge but also your passive damage and your ultimate damage increasing means that you can actually probably afford to go like maybe tankier builds not like full Bruiser like back in the day with Gore Drinker I mean maybe you could still make it work right because base damage is increasing this means you can actually afford to go something else but really I'm talking is something like eclipse and ghostblade or Black Cleaver right you're going something a little bit more kind of defensive than just full out lethality or like Prowler school or you know ghostblade Edge unite something like this right so it opens up more builds for talent but these look like really nice busts then the mid lane he's going to be so much better now the other Champion getting buffed this is galio and honestly I think these bars are really Placebo so your ease cooldown going down by a second if you're a bit more pressure in line yeah when you get your e back up and in team fights maybe you get like another one off and the other buff here is that your W's damage reduction is going up and it's also going to scale more off the Mi you have but this looks like you know if galio was a tanky Champion can you guys remember when galio was picked as a top laner he was just like a pure tank and you used to just like stack magic resist nowadays it's not really the case because you want to be building AP the only item that maybe like suits this buff is Banshee as well but are you really gonna get benches as galio probably not right so I think both of these Buffs are pretty Placebo and they're not really going to change much but galio now moving into the champion nurse Yumi is getting nerfed I don't even care like what the nurse are guys like you guys can read this right and you can you know I don't know go on Reddit and see what people are saying I don't care delete this champion and I'll be happy honestly like I'm calling for it guys if you're playing ranked if you're playing actually any sort of League of Legends ban Yumi seriously I want a bandra to be like 100 so right have no choice but to remove it from the game she's super op at the moment because of the changes in this patch or last patch I guess 13.5 and yeah I'm just sick of talking about it Banner get rid of them now two other Champions getting nerfed both of these actually reside in the mid lane and one of them you can play in the bot Lane this being vegar and this is where these Nerfs are targeted towards bot Lane Vega your base HP going down to 550 your base armor going down by three and armor in the bot Lane lots of Champions are attack damage base this means you're going to be Swisher early on and also your W's damage is decreasing in the early game but increasing at later ranks now are these really big Nerfs for Vega like are they going to make him like unplayable of course not right he's still going to be very broken and the thing about your armor going down and even your base HP is that you're still very hard to touch right because of the bus a couple of patches ago where they increase your range on your q and your W you can still stand like really far back and kind of chill even if Vegas base armor was like zero it doesn't actually really change too much so I still think Vegas win rate is an AP carry bot Lane is going to be off chops of course in the mid lane this is a bit of a Nerf because you are in a 1v1 and there are oppressive champions in the early game in the mid lane especially against 80 assassins rhizo Talon said your base armor going down you're going to to get hit a lot harder and probably die a lot more but yeah bot Lane Vega you're still chilling now aurelian Seoul is the other Champion getting nerfed Guys these are for sure nurse but are they gonna make aurelian Soul like not an S plus two champion in pretty much like every single rank I don't think they will I still think he's going to be really op so you're equal down being a flat 12 seconds the amount of Stardust required for your second ultimate so your upgrade is now going up to 100 your stun duration on your ultimate and the knock-up duration are both going down to one second your cast range on your R1 is decreasing and the R2 cast range is also decreasing they're both going to be 1100 honestly a radian soul with this like you know rower into rylies with so much HP you get even though his HP got nerfed and 13.5 his win rate is still like 53 across every single rank get me out now System bus guys the only item getting buffed here is Nash's tooth and right have cooled it above so what's happening is the cost is going up by 200 to 3200 in total and the ability haste is going up to 15. so pretty much you're getting 15 ability heads for 200 gold which kind of sounds efficient but the issue here is that people or Champions building if Nash is too for the moment so if we think of Katarina kale if we think of Gwen ability hey so they don't really care too much maybe Gwen like it feels really nice to have ability haste but for Katarina for kale this doesn't actually really do anything this is just like a straight up Nerf and I think this is really unfortunate for those Champions but some Champions will benefit of course Champions like maybe Diana maybe Echo Gwen can still definitely feel this maybe even like AP Shaco might be interested by this maybe Kaiser will be interested by this because the ability has also Nash is giving you attack speed ride for your evolutions and AP of course 100 AP that is a big chunk it is to the benefit of some Champions it is to the detriment of other Champions now system nurse we've got five to talk about first of all dragons the kill bus are going to be reduced by around 10 to 15 this just means that dragons are going to be less important or I guess like impactful on the outcome of a game so yeah kind of a Nerf to like the bot side of the map I guess now BT is getting nerve The Shield you're getting is just decreasing in every single rank The Shield is actually like activating earlier at level eight don't really think this changes or anything but yeah BT is just getting nerve to the shield you're getting from this and staying on this kind of like topic of BT bloodline is also getting nerve so the maximum lifesteal you're getting is decreasing and also the max HP you get once you stack the item is decreasing as well so if you're going something like bloodline BT and then you're getting Shield bow as well pretty much makes you unkillable as an 80 carry and you should be killable right so it's maybe unfortunate that nothing like everything here regarding this like kind of setup but yeah this is what the balance team are doing now navori quick plays is also getting nerfed guys so the cooldown refund is going down to 12 for 15 and the reason I think Ryder doing this is just because Champions like you know Ezreal maybe Kaiser Zaire of course these range champers these 80 carries are actually just like abusing this item a bit too much right especially those Eddie carries I mentioned because it means your cooldowns your abilities on such low cooldowns like it's really annoying to play against right but for Champions like Gangplank like Tryndamere other Champions like Melee champions for the most part who are building this are gonna be more affected by this so again pretty unfortunate for Champions like GP like Trinity who are going to vory this will affect you a lot now lethal Tempo guys is the final thing getting nerfed her and if you have enjoyed this video please remember to leave a like down below and hit that subscribe button so you don't miss any of our future season 13 uploads and the lethal Tempo the range attack speed is decreasing so the actual stacking in the early game is decreasing and this is going to be maxed out at level 18 now so you get the extra 54 rather than at level 12. definitely enough for sure but you're still getting 24 extra attack speed monsters Max stack and you're still getting 54 at level 18 most games in most silos are still going to go into the late game so these are Nerfs on paper but I don't think it's going to have like the biggest impact in the world but those were the changes guys we know of so far for 13.6 again any thoughts any questions you have leave them in the comment section and until our next season 13 upload this has been eggs peace ","65":"problem constantly I think is just like the easiest jump to play Just Ops in majority of Team comps I think Cinder is really hard to play so I think there wouldn't be ass in an average Master tier player if you're an average Master two player seeing that would probably be or be a b or c tier Champion but if you're a challenger player and you're really good at seeing Russian you just asked her so this is kind of hard right when you're making a tier list it's very hard to put where you want to put champions yes if you make a top and tier list a lot of people are going to say pure is the best jump in the game how many people can play Fiora nobody almost that's the problem [Music] ","66":"what's going on game weepers this is easy in today's video we're going to be talking about the changes for 13.8 these are the real changes these are the details that we were talking about in yesterday's list to change this video to make sure you stick around for the whole thing we've also got a couple more inclusions and exclusions so some Champions we mentioned yesterday are not getting changed some Champions we didn't mention will be getting changed so of course make sure you stick around for the whole video If you do actually want to improve though guys do you think like alistair's ultimate lasting a little bit longer means anything it doesn't all right like you're still going to be the same hardstoke Alice to play same with all these other Champions well apart from maybe a couple because some of the Buffs and even Nerfs do look a little bit cooked but yeah if you actually want to improve guys our Challenger players and coaches are uploading daily content to the websitegamely.com link Down Below in the description and comment section if you don't improve and therefore climb because that's really what climbing is I will be amazed this fast food stuff we're putting on YouTube like it doesn't mean anything bro you can watch it for a bit of fun but that wound you're trying to treat bro like this is just a Band-Aid man it's still gonna be there at the end of the day anyway let's get into the 13.8 changes so first of all let's talk about Champion boss when we're going to alphabetical order here so obviously yeah I mentioned it just then your ultimate is going to last one and a half seconds longer this means that you will be tankier for sure in those team fights and yeah I think this is fine I don't think it will really like improve his win rate by all that much they're buffing out through a lot as well recently maybe there's a skin coming out yeah Alistair this buff whatever now Ezreal is also getting buffed guys your base attack damage is going up by two from 60 to 62 which means pretty much just early game you're gonna be better off and I think this is nice for Ezreal because your big weak point is your early game in the late game when she started getting you know lots of cues off you start getting the essence wherever manamune prox ride you're gonna be chilling but until that point it's actually pretty difficult especially in lane at the moment there are lots of Champions who will you just give a free Lane to because you're really not the strongest laner but in the matter at the moment Israel can really fit in because against engaged Champions he does really well because of his Arcane shift think about blitzcrank thresh it should be impossible to kill in Ezreal like if they actually have their screen turned on so whenever his early game gets buffed he actually becomes even better and because the meta is what it is at the moment I think ezrael will actually have a place in the 13.8 meta we might even see him picked a little bit more in Pro play play now Karen is getting some pretty sizable Buffs here guys so your base attack damage a bit like ezrael's is increasing but it's increasing by three from 66 to 69 so in the early game early Landing phase your attacks are going to be dealing a little bit more damage also your base armor is going up by two as well this means that if you're playing Garen in the Top Lane and for the most part you're going to be going against attack damage Champions base armor going up means you're going to be more resistant to that attack damage so not only are you dishing a little bit more but you're not taking as much as before so 13.8 Garen could actually be a problem now moving down to the supports we have Janna here but we didn't actually really mention in yesterday's video and yet Janna is getting buffed so your W the actual base damage is going up by 10. the AP ratio is going up 20 and the Decay delay in your e is doubling from 1.25 to two and a half seconds these bus for General I mean the W damage buff going up this might mean you might actually want to Max your w a little bit earlier and the AP ratio going up as well well it might be useful when she gets Australia's battle song because this is still giving you 40 AP but again I don't really think like these are the biggest bus in the world they might mean something but at the moment Janna is kind of struggling in The Meta because engaged Champions do really Tucker like thresh blitzcranker very hard to Lane against Nautilus is pretty difficult right so Janna isn't having the best time so these Buffs for sure they're bust but I don't really think anything is going to change too much but a champion who is going to change in my opinion anyway a lot in 13.8 is kha'zix so because of the changes in 13.7 where they pretty much made your w a non-ability kha'zix needs a bit more power here to be able to compete in the jungle still it's all Rider doing they're increasing your Q's base damage by 10 at each rank this is really big like your accused base damage this is the ability you're maxing first so you're getting the max juice out of this and because your Q is such a big part of your like isolation and nuke damage you know you're 100 to zero actual combo this is really big for karthiks this means that well particularly in the other game as well because the damage is going up this will also help with your clear as well don't forget but yes this will help you secure kills and hopefully get the Snowballs going a lot earlier than what you are right now so a pretty nice patch for the Cockroach now moving down to the bot Lane we have pogmore AKA cold more and your passive damage is increasing a little bit in the early game up to 100 in the late game you accuse cool down is also going down by a second and your ease man of course is going down and the slow is increasing honestly kind of placebo your e really isn't a big part of your kid if you're playing like you know attack speed on hit cogmore for your passive damage when you go boom makes it a little bit scarier for people to like dive you on the tower during the laning phase because you aren't the strongest Champion especially at the moment with Lulu and Yumi being kind of weak and those engaged supports being strong it's pretty scary playing in the ball Lane and your Q's cooldown's going down your Q is actually a really useful ability but it's not really going to actually like Empower cold war that much so 13.8 I still think it would be a little the same to what is happening to coldmore right now kind of an okay ad carry but doesn't stack up to the best that he carries in the ball Lane now staying in the bot Lane another support getting buffed is Leona so your bonus armor and Magic resist you get from your W is increasing by 1080 Tran can also the magic damage dealt from your W is also up by 10 if we compare Leona to those strong engage supports at the moment so if we're talking like blitzcrank baby even Pike thresh Nautilus she doesn't match up to them this is why she's getting buffed I think these Buffs are really nice as well they make you tank here they make your all in like a lot better because the magic damage from your W so Leona could actually be picked a heck of a little more in 13.8 and she does well against lots of Champions in the bot Lane and given the meta at the moment I think she'll definitely be played more and win more because of these now Lilia in the jungler is getting buffed guys so the monster damage cap you have this is going up in the early game this Ultra clear speed of course the monster healing you're getting this is also increasing in terms of Base Healing early on but it is decreasing later but that's because you're getting a lot more AP out of it so the actual percentage is going up to 15 rather than being just around five percent so as you start getting AP from your items right this space healing Nerf it will actually just be a buff at pretty much every single rank then we have Champion healing as well which is going down in the later stages of the game but just like the monster healing it is scaling more of your AP 30 of it these are nice spots for Lilia and they'll definitely see her win rate improve now a champion on this list who I think is getting the biggest like kind of bus of all this is nidalee so your base armor is going from 28 to 32 your armor growth is going from 4.7 to 5. so not like the biggest increase in the world where but for nidalee like I don't think you have any counters in the jungle anyway and because you're going to be so much tankier just innately this means like you might not even have to build like a zhonyas you can probably go something like I don't know what shadow flame Death Cab there's a bunch of options you can go second item like after night Harvester or rocket build this is just so big for you she's gonna be so much harder to kill most jungles as well are going to be attack damage base so nidalee is going to be the queen of the jungle again and I think this is really risky as well for high reelers I think she'll be permabad but all you cougar Mains out there you should be super stoked about this now poppy is another jungler potentially getting buffed here to accuse Target HP damage is increasing by one percent and the bonus resistances you get from your W they're increasing to 12 so pretty much like a 20 buff here and these are nice for poppy especially considering the cutest Target HP damage might be useful in the Top Lane so yeah poppy getting Buffs these will definitely help her out unfortunately guys if you're playing Zoe in 13.8 well at the moment she's not getting buff next patch she's actually been pulled from the patch and honestly for good reason I don't know why they put Zoe on this list I said in yesterday's video right don't know why she's getting buffed she's still so good in like solo queue which is where like 99.9 of us play it's a little bit weird to put her on here so I kind of understand why they pulled it from the patch but a little bit disappointing for you Zoe made now Champion nurse there are five Champions here so we have an extra addition here guys so really in soul is getting Nerf so your HP growth is going down by five this means you'll have less HP in the late game whenever alien Soul has like a rallies if you are going Rod of Ages don't really recommend it but if you are right you have a lot of HP you're very hard to kill in the mid to late game and most games in lower reelers in particular are going to go to the late game and a real insole will make use of this HP this going down I think it's fine your armor growth is also getting nerfed as well though this means that yeah again in the mid to late game you're going to be more killable there's going to be more counter play to this champion because yeah for most people I think it's just very difficult to play against him once he gets to like level 15 16 Etc the game becomes kind of unplayable and there is very little actually to do against this Champion making him more killable I actually think it's good now j4 is getting nerfed as well and I think this just makes sense right this Champion it's just the ultimate jungler at the moment your ad growth is going down less damage in the mid to late game you'll accuse damage as well as going down by 1080 track and this is big for j4 because your Cube well it's your main source of damage this means in terms of clear speed dueling ganking you're dealing less damage there's gonna be less kills for you on the map so j4 will be worse off I still think he'll be good by the way but just not as good now Kane shadow assassin Kane guys is a new addition here so your Shadow e the cooldown is actually going up by one second and the bonus movement speed you get from your e this is going down from 80 to 70 so these are definitely nerves your win rate will decrease a little bit but you're still maintaining a lot of the power you already had and the equal ain't going up by one second you're still going to be able to use this a lot once you actually do get a lot of ability Haze right from your items shadow assassin cane should still be fine but I actually kind of like agree with him getting nerfed I think he's a super good champion at the moment the Blue version of Kane that is not Ross Ross is still kind of trash but yeah blue cane getting nerfed for sure now we also have malphite also known as Mr rock according to the change list and your first Auto attack on your W the base damage is decreasing if you put more points in this so Rider may be trying to discourage you guys from actually putting points in your W because that is like really the most OPP version of malphite grassly undying with a W Max so yes you getting less damage from your W when you put more points into it kind of makes sense if that's their aim and your cleave armor ratio okay from your W is going down as well so based off the armor you actually have your W will be dealing less damage so nurse to malphite for sure if you're maxing W so we'll have to see how Rock Solid performs in 13.8 but it definitely won't be as good as what he's doing in 13.7 last champion here guys getting nerfed this is for a car and your base armor is going down by two and your armor growth has also decreasing what's a buffer nurse like this in this patch but that's what's happening to record this means that your early game well you're just going to be more exploitable right and hopefully more killable because the champion is just so good at the moment and your armor growth going down means in the mid to late game yeah you're going to be more killable as well you just can't like blindly engage into a team fight and be chilling so you're gonna have to pick your spot a little bit more as rakan be a little bit more calculated so those are the bus on those guys for the champions of 13.8 thank you so much for watching the video any questions any thoughts you have leave them in the comment section until our next season 13 upload the spinnings peace thank you ","67":"13.7 is loaded with over 15 Champions being changed along with a couple item alterations to go along with it with the help of our Challenger players and analyzing the most recent data we are set to bring you guys an update on the solo Q tier list for every single role but before we get into it be sure to check out skill cap if you want to truly get better at League of Legends we're the only service that offers a money-back guarantee if you don't climb at least five divisions while actively using our service we do this because our service really does work and if it doesn't work for you you shouldn't pay learn more at the end of this video or click the link in the description below way back in patch 13.1 deathstance saw some major changes and in 13.7 Riot has decided to completely revert them haste is being added back onto the item A.D is going back down from 65 to 55 and the armor is reduced from 50 to 45. buildpath has also been reverted meaning that Warhammer is now a component again instead of a pickaxe it will really depend on the champion as to whether this ends up being a buff or a Nerf for someone like Riven who uses haste very well it's likely to be a net positive change on the flip side someone like Yasuo who's not as reliant on ability haste is going to end up worse off due to this change to be fair though very few Champions are even building death stance as a core item right now it's usually purchased as a third or fourth item so this change won't shift The Meta in any drastic way a minor buff to Abyssal mask is on the way with its Health going from 500 to 550. very few Champions are even building Abyssal right now but with this change it may become a more integral pickup on a few tanks like maokai cho'gath and Mumu and orn still a situational purchase at best but when your team is very AP heavy and the enemy team is as well the damage amp and Magic resist will work really nice in those Niche spots all Grievous wounds items will be changed for 13.7 so that the debuff now applies to targets that completely block the damage with shields this buff will only come into effect in a select amount of games and in some games it won't even matter at all so we don't see the buff being overly impactful Rod of Ages users won't be getting that sweet 1100 Catalyst buy anymore and will instead need an extra 200 gold which now matches the cost of lost chapter Catalyst will have its Health increased by 75 to compensate for the 200 gold increase gold value wise you're not actually losing any efficiency since 75 health is worth 200 gold but it is a Nerf due to the fact you're delaying your item Spike by a wave or two Olaf has been a top tier carry for most of season 13. so Riot has a few Nerfs lined up for 13.7 passive attack speed is going from 60 scaling to 100 to 50 scaling to 100 Q damage is also down by five at all ranks both Nerfs that Target Olaf's early game Power which is when he's at his strongest definitely not Nerfs that are killing blows to the champion but Olaf will be saying goodbye to the optier for this patch making his way down to S despite there being a ton of changes this patch Top Lane is the role Riot has gone very light on as Olaf is the only champ changed that means the overall meta for Top Lane won't be shifting very much for 13.7 now that Olaf is dropping into s we are moving Darius down as well and leaving malphite as the only op top laner malphite is simply miles ahead of everyone else in terms of his ability to be consistently impactful so he should be the pickerban champ coming out of the top Lane after low ELO Top Lane carries include York malphite and nasus Fiora Darius and malphite are who we have highest on the ban list unlike Top Lane jungle is where the meat of the changes lie for 13.7 with seven junglers being adjusted most of the changes are Nerfs but the one jungler being buffed is Graves crit bonus is going from 20 to 30 percent our cooldown is reduced by a pretty healthy amount at rank 1 going from 120 to 100 seconds if you guys are looking to learn Graves we actually just uploaded our master and minutes course for Graves to our website it's a very quick and easy to digest course that covers everything you need to know to become a master of the champ as for Graves power level heading into 13.7 as long as players are building him correctly he's going to be a good eight-tier pick ever since umbral glaive was nerfed it's been performing quite poor on graves while a Gore Drinker with Black Cleaver Bruiser build has been seeing much better results kha'zix is being adjusted in a few different ways for 13.7 with a couple Buffs and Nerfs being thrown in isolation range is going from 425 to 375. this is a buff as the enemy now has to be a little closer to one of their teammates for them to not be isolated if all W slow is going from 60 to 40 percent while the evolved isolated slow is down from 90 to 75 percent our duration is going up from 10 to 12 seconds all in all we expect these changes to be pretty neutral or slightly on the positive side the iso buff is really nice and will help make assassination plays a little more reliable kaha has been very close to breaking into s tier in previous patches so as a result of these changes we will be giving him the bump a bit weird to see another rammus Nerf but Riot's reasoning behind it is likely due to the champ continuing to over perform in the lower ranks W percent bonus armor is going from 40 scaling to 100 to 40 scale into 80 take note that ramus doesn't actually Max W out until last as he prioritizes Q first into e second you won't even feel this Nerf until you hit Level 14 so some games this change won't even come into effect this is actually a pretty smart way to Nerf Ram is for the lower ranks but keep him in check for higher elos as low ELO games tend to last a little bit longer overall we don't see ramus losing much power from the Nerf and he will remain in 80 your jungler the next jungler Nerf for 13.7 is going to be sejuani sedge will have her passive damage cap against dragon and baron lowered from 300 to 250. Q cooldown is also being increased by one second at all ranks lastly our cooldown is being increased by 10 seconds at all ranks this is definitely more of a pro play Nerf as sedge has not been performing overly well in solo queue as a result of these Nerfs we will be shifting her from a tier into B VI has been another jungler highly prioritized in Pro play for the past while so a Nerf to her tank build is being issued cube-based damage is being significantly lowered however the ad ratio is up to try and stop players from building radiant virtue he is seeing the exact same treatment with the base damage down and the 80 ratio going up Divine sunderer will become a more valuable pickup now in 13.7 and even after these changes we still see Vai as a good solo q jungler a tier is where Vai will be landing on the tier list Wukong has been one of the most OP jungle picks in recent patches so he'll be tagged with three separate Nerfs base ad is going from 68 to 66 W cooldown is being increased from 22 2 scaling to 12 seconds to 22 scaling to 14 seconds e bonus attack speed is down by five percent at all ranks these Nerfs aren't going to completely remove Wukong from meta but he will no longer be a premier jungle carry moving from op into a tier for 13.7 Lee sin will be receiving similar treatment to Wukong this patch as his base ad is being lowered as well base 80 is going from 68 to 66 while Lee sin's base armor is down from 36 to 34. a shift from s into a is what we see fit for Lee due to these changes Jarvan avoids nurse for 13.7 so he will continue to dominate The Jungle meta alongside fiddle and Evelyn as the op picks with the likes of Lee sin Wukong and VI all Nerf this patch watch out for gragas and Kane to take a step forward both have been really solid jungle picks in previous patches and will be even better S tier pickups for 13.7 our top three low ELO recommendations for Jungle are fiddle mordekaiser and Jarvan Evelyn Kane and Jarvan are a few of the best jungle bands Riot continues to chip away at azir and has a bunch of additional changes lined up for 13.7 for context azir currently holds the lowest win rate for any cell Q mid laner so he's definitely in need of some Buffs a couple base stat changes with armor going from 19 to 22 while attack speed growth is up from five to six percent passive duration is being increased from 30 to 45 seconds while the passive summon range is up from 500 to 700. Q Mana cost is being altered from 65 scale into 85 to 70 scaling to 110. Q stab range is also nerfed going from 370 to 325 W Mana cost is being reduced from 40 at all ranks to 40 scaling to 20. W damage per rank is up from 50 scaling to 90 to 50 scaling to 118. W total damage is increased going from 50 scale to 200 to 50 scale into 210. the big takeaway from these changes are that Riot is trying to shift power away from azir q and into his W instead of being a poke Mage they really want his identity to shine as this consistent DPS character we see azir gaining some power off the back of these changes but not enough to significantly shift him up the tier list so we'll be leaving him in C for now tank cat has become her most optimal build in recent patches so right is trying to combat that in 13.7 passive AP ratio is being increased by five percent at all ranks our ad ratio is going down from 18 to 16 bonus ad a hit to the Divine sunderer rush but a buff to Nasher so a positive outcome in our books the nashers into rocket belt core will be a little stronger in 13.7 we'll be leaving Kat in the S tier for the time being Yasuo will be receiving a couple of scaling Buffs this patch to his passive and E passive Shield is going from 100 scaling to 475 to 100 scaling to 575. e-sweeping Blade damage is being changed from 25 base damage per stack up to two stacks to 15 scaling to 25 base damage per stack up to 4 Stacks this means Yasuo e will be a little weaker early on but will become stronger later in the game for a High ELO this honestly may end up being more detrimental due to how much more important the early game is but for the lower ranks Yasuo will definitely see an increase in win rate we won't be shifting aso's tearless placement leaving him in a tier vegar Mains are fuming right now as Riot has basically killed the champion for mid lane while trying to combat his Superior power level for bot Lane qap ratio is going from 60 at all ranks to 45 scaling to 65 WAP ratio has changed from 100 to 70 scaling to 110 our AP ratio is nerfed going from 75 at all ranks to 65 scaling to 75 WAP ratio being chopped by 30 percent of rank 1 is a tough pill to swallow e-max second has always had the higher win rate on vegar which means if you are maxing W last you'll have 30 percent less AP ratio on the spell for the majority of the game this change will likely lead to W Max second becoming a must now but at the expense of having a much longer cooldown on E for mid-game fights whichever way you look at it this definitely hurts vegar and will be moving him down into B tier as a result for the mid lane tier list We've Got Annie Cassiopeia and Pantheon taking home the op tier slots even though Annie is being nerfed this patch the Nerf is to her e and at the later ranks only which does not actually affect mid Annie much at all support Annie is the one being hit the hardest while mid lane Annie will continue to be very powerful our top three low ELO picks for mid lane our Heimerdinger malzahar and Annie highest in the ban list are Annie Zed and Fizz kicking off the ADC changes kalista will be the lone ADC buffed for 13.7 attack damage growth is going from 3.5 to 3.75 quite disappointing if you're a Calista player as she's not a champ pick because of her scaling power so buffing that aspect of her game doesn't really do anything Kalisto will remain down in the B tier despite the buff Zary is the only other ADC change this patch and she's being targeted with a couple Nerfs Health growth is going from 115 to 110 passive Shield steel is down from 60 to 50 percent our ad ratio will be dropping from 100 to 85 percent Zary had been a very sound s tier pick in recent patches but with these Nerfs being issued we see her slotting in as an a-tier champ moving forward the ADC tier list is looking a little different this patch with Jinx being the only op carry vegar could very well still be argued as a fringe op pick as well but Jinx is without question the best traditional ADC you can play recent Q Buffs have put Ash in a pretty underrated spot and she's doing even better with a full crit build now as opposed to on hit vane is back to being a worthwhile ADC in the correct spots thanks to her bus from 13.6 if you can pick vayne with an enchanter's support or when the enemy team locks a couple of beefier Champions she can get the job done optimal low ELO bot Lane carries include Tristana Misfortune and vegar a few adcs who are worth a ban right now include Jinx vegar and Samira it seems like every second patch this season Riot is throwing in some sort of Alistar buff and they're back at it again for 13.7 armor is going from 44 to 47 base health is up from 670 to 685. pretty minor changes overall that will enhance alistair's Landing power smidge but don't expect him to come back into meta due to these Buffs eight years where Alistair lands on the support tier list Annie's support has been extremely dominant for multiple patches now so some Nerfs are finally on the way e cooldown is going from 12 scaling to 8 seconds to 12 scaling to 10 seconds eBay's Shield is nerfed as well going from 60 scaling to 220 to 60 scaling to 200. definitely changes that are going to push Annie more in line with other support picks but we don't see them being enough to remove Annie from meta a slight adjustment from op into s is what we see fit for 13.7 the final Champion change to the patch is going the way of thresh Q cooldown refund on hit is being lowered from 3 seconds to 2 seconds a welcome Nerf as thresh is almost playing Earth in recent patches with how low the cooldown on Q could get in mid to late game team fights like Annie we will be adjusting thresh down one tier going from op into s support tier list sees a shake-up for 13.7 with Emilio rakan Senna and blitzcrank making up the op tier there's a nice mix of a little bit of everything on top of the support meta if you want to play a strong enchanter then milio is the top dog looking for a strong hard engage support rakan most definitely fits the bill for a more damage oriented carry you have Senna is a great option and for the instant pick power with thresh being nerfed Blitz takes a step up top three low ELO supports the patch are Emilio Annie and Zyra Recon thresh and milio are a few supports worth Banning out alright guys before we wrap this up let's tell you a little more about skill cat so we offer a five division rank up guarantee and think that's a pretty crazy thing to offer it's like a gym membership gear you'll get ripped your local gym would go bust if they offered that right not us we've offered this for years because our service really does work it works so well in fact that we're able to produce by far the largest catalog of Premium League guides on the internet we add over 20 videos a week with over 1600 guides curated into over 100 courses no one can compare we've also sent Challenger players into ELO hell's 714 times and Counting where they commentate how to carry live they also respond to all questions asked sign up today for as little as 6.99 a month if you are serious about improving so that's going to round everything out for this one thank you guys so much for watching good luck out there in 13.7 and we'll see in the next one thank you ","68":"ADC is being heavily targeted this patch with a bunch of item and Rune Nerfs vayne has been a bottom dwelling ADC in recent patches but that's about to change in 13.6 we've got all this and so much more to cover as we provide you guys a complete update on the solo Q tier list thanks to the help of our Challenger players and analyzing the most recent data but before we get into it be sure to check out skill cap if you want to truly get better at League of Legends we're the only service that offers a money back guarantee if you don't climb at least five divisions while actively using our service we do this because our service really does work and if it doesn't work for you you shouldn't pay learn more at the end of this video or click the link in the description below one of the most OP builds of recent patches has revolved around rushing bloodthirster so it's being heavily nerfed in 13.6 The Shield value of bloodthirster is going from 180 all the way down to 100 from levels one to level 8. Shield value at the later ranks is not being lowered as much so although it is a Nerf in general it's a much harder Nerf if you're rushing bloodthirster third item bloodthirster in the correct spots will remain a goodbye but we expect rushing the item to no longer be viable not only is BT being nerfed with the life steal on Legend bloodline is going down as well Max life steal drops from six down to 5.25 Max health is also down from 100 to 85. more priority to alacrity now in 13.6 another ADC Rune Nerf consists of lethal Tempo losing attack speed for range Champions only going from 30 scaling to 54 to 24 scaling to 54 instead of maxing out at level 12 it will now Max out at level 18. this is a decent hit to lethal tempo as you won't have that super strong mid-game Spike like it offered before Zary and xayah are two adcs who don't really run any other Rune than lethal so they'll be hit the hardest here for adcs who have completely viable Alternatives we expect them to shine more in 13.6 Misfortune for example performs just as well with press the attack so she likely will completely phase out lethal from a repertoire Tristana does great with Halo blade so especially when you're paired with the melee engage support hob will be way more valuable you can expect a small uptick in power for non-lethal Tempo users like Jin Samira Nila Lucian and Ezreal quickly is the other ADC item Nerf for 13.6 with its cooldown refund going from 15 to 12 percent Gangplank ziya sivir Tryndamere Kaiser Lucian Ezreal and zerry are the Avid quickblades users at the moment who will be hit the hardest by this Nerf surprised there aren't any compensation changes for Gangplank though considering he was also directly in our last patch and saw his win rate drop over three percent ziya is being hit from many different angles this patch and will be in a much more balanced State now with lethal bloodthirster and quick blades changes affecting her majority of item and Rune changes are nerfed this patch but we do have one item being buffed which is nasher's tooth it's not really a flat out buff though as you are now gaining 15 ability haste in exchange for the item costing 200 more gold we actually expect this to be a Nerf for someone like Katarina who doesn't benefit as much from ability haste due to her passive resets Teemo and kale are tough to call because haste isn't a vital stat for them so nashers being 200 gold more expensive may end up more detrimental spellcasting National users like Gwen Diana shyvana azir and Echo will be the Champions benefiting the most from the alterations honestly we kind of suspect this change was issued in the first place all because of his ear Riot wants azir building nashers now and adding haste to the item will definitely make it more viable one final non-champion change for 13.6 consists of dragon Buff's Effectiveness being reduced by 10 to 15 percent we actually just uploaded a video last week talking about how dragon is abate a lot of the time for solo queue so definitely check that out if you haven't with these changes the message behind that video becomes even more true moving forward not a single direct change to any Top Lane champion this patch so let's dive right into the tier list despite no traditional top laner being buffed we do have one Niche Top Lane pick who will be moving up in power vayne is seeing Buster 13.6 and although she's more commonly played down in the bot Lane Top Lane vein will become much stronger as well from a to S tier is where we will be moving vayne on the tier list Canon is one other champ we have moved up for 13.6 is his bus from lastpatch have turned out a little bit more impactful than first expected gangblank moving down into B tier is the third change to the Top Lane tier list as quick blades Nerfs will put him in an even weaker spot after falling to a 47 win rate from his 0 direct Nerfs in 13.5 GP could very well be the lowest win rate top laner now for 13.6 optimal low ELO Top Lane Champs include your Garen and nasus Fiora Darius and malphite are who should be banned the most jungle is just like Top Lane in the sense that the role has been issued a grand total of zero direct changes for 13.6 jumping right into the tier list we have fiddle Eve and Jarvan reigning Supreme once again definitely watch out for Echo this patch as the nashers changes are looking great and he'll be a really strong s tier option with Dragons becoming weaker in a way it's more of a Nerf to a jungler like shyvana whose kit directly benefits from securing dragons shiv is already in a pretty poor spot at the moment so definitely much better options than 13.6 top 3 low ELO jungle recommendations include fiddle mordekaiser and Jarvan highest on the Jungle Band list are Evelyn Kane and Jarvan mid lane is the role with the most amount of changes this patch and we'll start off by covering the galio Buffs e cooldown is going from 12 scaling to 8 seconds to 11 scaling to 7 Seconds W damage reduction is up as well from 20 scaling to 40 percent to 25 scaling to 45 magic resists scaling on W is up two going from 8 to 12 nothing major here that is going to push galio back into meta but he can definitely be used as a good counter to Champs like Katarina Silas and akali Zed has held the crown as the best mid lane assassin for a while now but Talon will have something to say about that in 13.6 base Mana is going up from 377 to 400. passive damage is up from 75 scaling to 255 to 80 scaling to 280. W manicost is down by five at all ranks our damage is up from 90 scaling to 180 to 90 scaling to 200. other than the r buff the three other changes directly Target Talon's strongest stage of the game early laning power will be going up with those Mana changes and the passive damage will further amplify Talon's all in strength definitely watch out for talent in 13.6 as he'll be the best mid lane assassin and a really strong s-tier pick Riot missed the mark on the 13.5 aurelian Soul Nerfs so they're back at it again in 13.6 e cooldown is going from 12 scaling to 10 seconds to a flat 12 seconds in all ranks Stardust required for R2 is going from 75 to 100 R1 stun duration is down from 1.25 to 1 second R2 knock-up duration is also down from 1.25 to 1 second R1 cast range takes a hit going from 1250 to 1100 our 2 cast range drops as well going from 1250 to 1100. honestly nothing too major with these Nerfs but they should finally be enough to Dethrone aurelion from his op tier standing so we'll be moving him into s for 13.6 a couple vegar Nerfs are lined up and these Nerfs are honestly more likely targeted at bot Lane vague than mid lane mid vegar is not performing all that insane analytically but bot Lane has upwards of a 53 win rate which is why he's being nerfed base health is going from 575 to 550. base armor is down from 21 to 18. W damage is being lowered from 100 scaling to 300 to 85 scaling to 305. armor Nerf definitely makes it quite clear Riot has planned these Nerfs around bot Lane vegar with that said playing mid lane vegar into the likes of Zed or Talon is just going to be that much more difficult moving forward as if vagar's early Landing wasn't already his glaring weakness it becomes even more one in 13.6 we will be making an adjustment to vagar's tier list placement moving him from s into a tier mid lane tier list is going to look pretty similar to last patch with a few minor adjustments Pantheon is being given the bump into ob-tier as his recent Buffs and ability to stomp on many of the meta mid lane champ makes him really good for solo queue Katarina is the other adjustment we're making pushing her down to a tier nasher's changes are more likely a Nerf than a buff to cat since her passive makes ability haste a bit of a wasted stat a lot of the time best low ELO mid lane carries the patch are vegar malzahar and Annie Annie aurelian soul and vegar are the best value mid lane bands vayne looks to be making a push back into meta for 13.6 with a few really nice Buffs on the way passive movement speed is going from 30 to 45 qad ratio is up from 60 scaling to 80 percent to 75 scaling to 115 percent Q buff duration is going from seven to three seconds W percent Health damage has changed from 4 scaling to 12 to 6 scaling to 10 these are without question some pretty massive Buffs when you put them all together Q Buffs are the most interesting because they'll definitely open things up for more 80 heavy builds to thrive rage blade has been the core second purchase on vein for a long time now but something like Shield bone to Blade of the ruined King will become indirectly stronger vayne was definitely in need of a boost but these changes could very well push her into a top tier position we'll be moving vayne all the way from C tier into a for 13.6 Ash is the other ADC buff for 13.6 but nowhere near to the extent of vayne passive damage is going from 110 to 115 small buff that should solidify Ash's good a tier pick nothing special but not weak either for the ADC tier list we have jinx as the only op pick lethal Tempo nurse will hurt Jinx slightly but that's really the only change she'll be affected by many other adcs are being nerfed even harder like ziya for example with lethal Tempo quick blades and bloodthirster Nerfs Jinx doesn't build quick blades or BT so she's going to be coming out of 13.6 much better off than most marksmen with so many changes we'll be sure to keep you guys updated if any new builds or Rune setups pop up throughout the patch to climb low ELO the fastest from ADC look into Tristana Misfortune or vegar highest on our ban list for ADC our Jinx vegar and Samira just a single support Champion being changed in 13.6 as we have some follow-up now Q cooldown has changed from 7.5 scaling to 6.25 seconds to 6.5 seconds at all ranks Q Mana cost is up from 50 scale into 75 to 50 scale into 100 Q range and speed are both being reduced the big one is that yumi's R will no longer provide resists you may have been projecting as an S tier pick had these Nerfs not gone through so with changes in mind we'll be leaving her in a for 13.6 opt for support does not change from last patch with Senna thresh Andy and Recon being the most optimal carries if you're looking for a new Duo to play in 13.6 then Pike with vegar is a really nasty combination vegar throwing down his cage followed by Pike pulling the enemy into the stun with his hook can lead to so many easy kills at level 6. top 3 low ELO picks for support include brand Heimerdinger and Zyra Recon thresh and Annie are all really good band options alright guys before we wrap this up let's tell you a little more about skill cap so we offer a five division rank up guarantee and think that's a pretty crazy thing to offer it's like a gym membership guaranteeing you'll

there you have it guys a complete look at the solo queue tier list heading into 13.6 thanks so much for watching good luck in solo queue and we'll see in the next one ","69":"what's going on game weepers it is the come and in today's video right I'm going to be giving you a tip for each of these broken Champions I'm not going to tell you guys well I might do actually why these champers are op okay because I'm sure most of us will know at the moment but I'm actually going to try to help you out like I want these videos to be informative will you actually leave them thinking I've become a better League of Legends player like that's what I want I know I'm the nutcode I know that I can coach people to tear climbs in like a week or two so I'm gonna try to give you tips on each of these Champions or maybe even the roles that actually help you improve okay now if you do actually want you know kind of like access to my coaching sessions I guess or if you just want access to a library of content that our Challenger players and coaches are you know just like adding to daily then make sure you check out the game lead website gamelib.com in the description of comment section I cannot urge you guys enough to do this if you do actually want to improve significantly in a short period of time that is all you have to do you just have to get signed up that's it and you can join thousands of your fellow Summoners to improving A League of Legends and peaking on the rift so yeah let's get into the 50 most broken Champions let's start by talking about the best for ad carries in yes there's four four out of 15 champions in this video already carries the first of these is Jake's who's getting some big boss and 13.5 so the buff to your attack speed ratio in particular is going to be huge now for Jinx on the bottlene right the actual tip here is to get used to swapping between your rockets and minigun looks so pressure way too many new Jinx players or inexperienced Jinx players I guess will just kind of like stand in Lane waiting for something to happen you know but you can actually insert really good pressure Yourself by swapping between your minigun and Rockets particularly your Rockets because they give you extra range and also Splash damage so if the enemy ad carry is standing too close to their minions you can hit the minions and hit the enemy ID carry in the process as well it's just a very good kind of like tip to do it will observe pressure so think about that when you're playing Jinx but next patch 13.5 I honestly think she'll be picked and banned because she'll be so good now moving on we have twitch now as twitch you're one of the best solo queue Champions right because of your own visibility and at the moment because of the buff to Blade of the Rune King For Rain Champions the extra on-head damage been huge for twitch as twitch it's really annoying right probably the biggest cuck is actually going to be your support funnily enough so what I want you to do when I'm I mean is I want you to try to control your support not to give away your position when you're stealthing because it's so annoying right like the enemy ID carrying might be farming the mid wave in the mid to late game and you're stealth thing in and you're ready to assassinate them and your support just runs straight at them and the enemy 80 carries like oh obviously twitch is next to him so they run off and you don't get a kill and then you spam ping and then you argue for the next 10 minutes so try to control your support by pinging them back so the enemy doesn't get suspicious this way you can actually come out of yourself Brian and Brian now Zaya I know she's getting nerfed and that blade called her is copping two nursing 13.5 and these will mean something your win rate is going to decrease but the champion because the attack speed burst kind of recently and they're getting rescinded in 13.5 you're still having all that power I still think she'll be very strong especially when she get into very quick blades but one tip here once you have Gale forced remember guys you can use the active the cloudburst active to reposition to land your feathers so you might have three feathers in one position and the enemy Champion is standing just a little bit to the side of them you can e and then gale force and they will get rooted by that animation this is a really cool tip it's also really useful as well just for like any situation if you need to reposition just to land your feathers if you're escaping if you're even like looking for an engage trying to Nuke the enemy ad carry or whoever it is it's a great tip so keep this in mind when you do get your Mythic now the final 80 carry is zerry I know lots of people think you have to pick zerry with Lulu or Yumi some attack speed buff honestly like you don't have to the great thing about like an Engaged support metaphoric is that it creates time and space for you to get stacking right and as long as your positioning is good as Zary you should be sweet and that's why her win rate has actually gone up if you think about it since the engagement came in so for Zary the tip is this if you are scared of getting gagged especially in the early game obviously right because this is when you are weakest then hug a close wall and get ready to e out of it your ears on a very long cooldown right in the early game so we want to make sure that when we use it we are using it when we know where the enemy jungler is but if we do go ganked we have it there ready think about holding a bit of terrain and have your index finger or whatever finger you have on your e-bun ready to use it and you won't die now moving to the mid lane here there are four Champions just like the ball Lane the first of these is Cassiopeia now I know that Sarah's Embraces getting Nerf next patch oh my goodness FF the ap's going down you're losing a bit of HP but what is making Cass op at the moment well Sarasota is one of them okay but when you run something like barrier right and then you have Seraph and the shield this is now giving you and then you have like gargles stone plate is your third item so whether you're getting like rower or leandries or everfrost depends on the enemy team composition right it's your Mythic item then you're getting Sarah's then you're getting gargles not only do you still have amazing GPS because you're Casio but you are unkillable the shields you have you can legit just Frontline as this Champion even though you're meant to be like some sort of controlled DPS Mage type Champion it doesn't matter at the moment the champion is super broken and that's why she's even getting blind picked in Pro play She's that good but yeah controlling your Mana early game is keep so don't just Spam your Q when it's off cooldown we want quality no quantity and you can take that tip and apply it so lots of mid laners or Champions so try to cue when your opponent is going for a last hit when they see seed by a teammate or when your opponent themselves is like locked into an animation so it might be like a zerath using his Q you may be so pay attention to those things and moving on we have fits now Fizz is getting some huge blouse guys in 13.5 the main one being to your ease Mana cost which means I think anyway the rocket build Fizz you can probably finally do this instead of going Mana mythics like ludens it's really frustrating right like it just feels like a cuck because back in the day you used to go Proto belt and I'm sure if you played against Proto belfizz you know how frustrating an OP this Champion can be with the extra damage from not only the rocket belt kind of active but yeah just more Mobility right there's another thing to worry about but the tip here guys for fits when the enemy Champion you're against you know they have no Escape or Flash using your Q with your ultimate is huge this means your Chandler Waters will be disguised as part of your Q animation it's very hard to react to just keep in mind as well try to you know use your ultimate at max range because this will deal more damage and yes that's what we want right on this Champion we want to amplify our damage output that means more one shot that means more kills and more snowballs and more wins now irelia is the only attack damage Champion here in the mid lane and I'm sure we all know why if you're going something like treadsborg Shield by whitsend you're unkillable especially in the mid lane and in the jungle as well at the moment lots of AP Champions are getting played and it makes you unkillable but yeah one tip for irelia is to try to e while uq this is what separates the best of rally is like a rail King from everyone else they will almost do this in like one animation so as you're blade surging towards a last set of all Minion use both parts of your e on the enemy Champion but one important thing and it's kind of like the Casio tip try to use your Q at the same time right so if you've got a last suitable minion as the enemy Champion has one themselves as well they will move forward you can q e e and bang you're probably gonna get that Champions flash now the final champion in the mid lane guys this is Vladimir and the reason Vlad is here is because of the cosmic Drive buff the AP on this going up to 90 is just massive for flat like AP is probably the most important therefore you your passive ride and it also means that you can actually one short people without doing too much in the mid to late game but the tip on Vladimir is not to skill an ability a level 2 or level 3 until you know where the enemy jungler is because sometimes you might get ganked in the early game yet and you need your w your pool to escape that gank but when you know like the enemy jungles ganking top you can put a point in your e you can put an extra point in your Q at level 3 if you want to so two points and two at level three is fine your early game knows your big weakness right so dying early on it will mean you will get snowballed on So just pay attention to where the enemy jungler is as far as your skill loader goes now moving into the top plane just like Eddie carries in just like the mid lane we have four Champions the first of these is Darius I don't want to talk too much about why darus is op durability matter it's still here Darris loves it your W is an auto attack reset that's what I want you to really remember lots of new dares players will just run in there without Auto attacking before using their W Auto attack and it's a loss of damage it's a loss of DPS conqueror stacking and Rich stacking this is really important right so when you're playing Darius guys try to all to attack before your W because your W when you press it after an auto attack it resets it so you actually get out more damage a lot quicker and also because you're using your W so quickly you'll get this cooldown up quicker as well and remember it's only on a five seconder so in the early game this can be really deadly I mean throughout the game it's deadly but yeah make sure you remember this W's in Auto attack reset moving on we have jax another Bruiser fighter now one trick on Jackson the early game which is when you almost vulnerable is to stun the minion wave with your helicopter as you're disengaging most of the time you will fight the enemy Champion unusual Counter-Strike but an experienced Jack's players will often forget to disengage and they will get called out right in the enemy minion wave and your cop so much Jaguar so as your ear is about to come to an end create a bit of space from the enemy Champion while moving back through the minions this will reset their aggro and you will cop zero damage from that point this makes your trading as efficient as possible of course you can extend that trade if you have lethal Tempo and you think you have kill thread but most the time you just want to be backing out in the early game after using your Counter-Strike Now One champion who's going to destroy Jackson 13.5 well I think so anyway because of the bust this is kanin and for Canon in 13.5 you are going to be dominating the Top Lane the bust your Q the AP ratio and the cooler yellow is huge and also your electrical search dealing more damage to minions gonna be really nice for your wave clip but for Kenneth in the mid to late game looking for flanks is key but do this guys with a red sweeper and also if you can afford them and have space for them a control Ward as well you don't want to play Canon waving at the enemy champions in front of them saying hey guys here I am you don't have to worry about me no no no no no no we want to be flanking we want to be operating in fog of War getting behind the enemy Champions using your flash using your ultimate using your rocket belt GG will play next patch if you can do this now if you do want to play a pure tank in the Top Lane guys the best of these by far is Scion at the moment now if you have TP on time think about alting bot or mid at a base after you've recalled right because your TP is going to allow you to TP straight back to the Top Lane so you're going to minimize their golden experience loss but you gain something Elsewhere on the map lots of people as well just won't be pinging this your enemy top laner so you can use this to your advantage now moving into the jungle there's only one jungler here this being j4 who I think is the most versatile jungle at the moment whether you're playing engage whether you're playing P or j4 doesn't really matter but one big tip for j4 is to flash alt or just old an EQ out of your cataclysm now of course most j4s are going to EQ in right and then use their ultimate which is good but the issue there is if you don't have stopwatch or if you're like not really tanky or ahead you're probably just gonna die right and trade your life so try to use your ultimate and save your EQ this means you can use your cataclysm and EQ out of it while keeping the enemy Champions trapped inside of it now the final rule guys of course to talk about this is the support role and this Champion you can play in the mid lane this is Annie now for Annie the three stacked threat I call it it's almost like when you play well I don't even know if there's another champion like it maybe a rally is like it okay so when you run three stacks you're passive when you use your Q on irelia you get to four Stacks right you get that extra attack speed that extra damage it's really really scary right same with Annie at Three Stacks what I want you guys to do is to use your e to get to four Stacks to activate that passive so that's done and then you can use your q and W straight away right lots of kind of like low ELO players won't expect this and it's a great way to get kills in your lane whether it's mid or bolt Lane now the final Champion guys who I think is honestly gonna be like the most broken in 13.5 and I don't want to talk about it too much this is going to be the new Yumi and honestly the tip for Yumi is just locking her in that that's literally all you have to do the fact that you now have a targeted ultimate I mean at the moment anyway when you press R it just goes in like One Direction right and we ain't talking the band but the new Yumi ultimate is going to be targeted based on where your cursor is so it will just follow where your cursor is that is just ridiculous I don't know like who is balancing the game but whoever it is please just make you be targetable it'll be so much healthier for the game and more enjoyable she won't be picked and bad it is complete aids to play against so yeah get me out but she will be really op so that's why I've got to include her in this video and those were the 15 most spoken Champions guys and a couple of tips for each of them for 13.5 make sure you hit that subscribe button so you don't miss our future season 13 uploads and all the tips I'm going to give you on our future videos and yeah this has been eggs peace ","70":"the 15 most broken Champions made for 13.1 B who are they gonna be guys I'm gonna go through 15 Champions this is by the way and you guys can make them in the comment section like your actual list who you think is going to be the most broken Champion maybe I've missed out on a champion who you think is going to be Giga op again let me know in the comments section what you think the list should be we've got champions from every single role every single class maybe not sure about that one but yes if you want to master guys any of these Champions or any of the roles in the game more importantly make sure you check out the Gameboy website description comment section the links are right there all you have to do is click on one and just sign up to get exclusive access to a massive library of content the best on the internet that is going to help you improve 100 our Challenger players and coaches are uploading daily videos or our thousands of subscribers so join the club get signed up and yeah let's get in to the YouTube video so first of all we'll start by talking about three top planers in this countdown and the first of these is Fiora now Fiora might be affected a little bit this patch by the executioners Bramble vest bus also oblivional if you're playing an AP champion in the Top Lane but yes executioners and then Brown will vest it's going to cut you a little bit that's why in yesterday's tearless video she wasn't even broken she moved down to S2 because of grass in the innate healing in your kit especially when you get your ultimate ride going into a bramble verse executioners or Oblivion orb champion because Grievous wins are going to be 40 effective on these items it's going to be harder obviously to make for Euro work but of course you'd still have your big strengths I mean Fiora with grass is just so disgustingly broken and with your device under a spike you should still be sweet but there are a couple of top laners who will be in a better position in 13.1 B and one of these is Jax now for Jax I mentioned in yesterday's video Blade the Rune King is actually getting nerve for Jax so the cooldown is going up 10 seconds and also the actual magic damage is going down as well before Jax you're probably going to rush to barnesandra pretty much in every single match up so it's not really a big deal and yes your healing might get nerfed because yes if someone has a bramble verse if someone has execution as oblivional grass Divine Sandra healing you might not appreciate this but tons of other top planers are going to be in a worse position right because of these Jacks you don't really have any healing in your kit so you should be chilly also Jackson is just gigger op like the changes they gave to him he's become incredibly broken especially because you proc that extra damage from your ultimate on your auto attacks every two Auto attacks instead of three now so Jax is still gonna be king of the Top Lane in my opinion but one champion who absolutely destroys Jax and is incredibly powerful during the laning phase this is Jace and that's all thanks to those Buffs last patch right so the extra bass attack damage Q damage W damage it's all too much to deal with at the moment also next patch Jace is going to well kind of be frothing it because eclipse is giving you ability haste now no longer is it giving top laners or anyone who builds the item I should say omnifamp so that's just completely gone you're getting a billy haste this is awesome for Jays of course because ability is where you just value this more than omnivamp of course so watch out for Eclipse Spike Jason 13.1 B and also yes because you can get executioners calling and just remember as well that mortal reminder now is not giving you any attack speed or movement speed like it's not building out a Zeal this is really nice for Jace as well because you just want raw damage right you want armor penetration you want to tag damage that's what Mortal reminder is now giving you huge for top point Jace and if you pair this with eclipse and the Mythic passive you will be shredding everyone it even improves your scaling and your laning phase like I said is just so dominant so he has to be in this video now moving down to the mid lane just like Top Lane we have three Champions the first of these casters said oh my God casting is getting Nerf your fourth pulse cooldown is going up who cares seriously like who cares well it might mean something actually I don't want to be too naive here but the thing for Cassidy is that this champ even if you 'd call down it's still getting reduced when enemy Champions use their abilities right by one second so in the mid to late game in team fights you'll be spamming this on repeat still and yes okay during the early game right you won't be threatening the enemy Champion as much but who cares about the laning players anyway like you still have enough tankiness from D Shield so you can win whatever you're going to get out of the laning phase and then to the mid to late game where you're so strong remember in 13.1 Rod of Ages saris Embrace got buff for kassadin like the extra HP from Roar the X-ray P you're getting which is huge now by the way from Saros and the lifeline pass of the actual Shield you get based on your max Mana this is huge forecast so I can't not put him on this countdown despite him getting nerfed so casting is another one now we also have Tristana who is the only attack damage mid laner in this video but honestly could even be like the number one champion in the entire game in 13.1 B because of the changes to Infinity Edge right so Infinity Edge the passive okay is now going to prog off 40 crit no longer 60 so what you can do is just get a crack inside and then get infinity edge as your second major item this is obviously huge this means that that spike is happening earlier and it's the biggest spike in the game for any attack damage carry right playing Tristana in the mid lane you might be like why I don't want to do this well she's actually just better in my opinion anyway in the mid lane you crushed so many champions like so many majors casting him for example is one of them he cannot touch a CS when a Tristana is in late also with a mobile Mages providing they don't have some sort of like knockback or cuck to your W your rocket jump you should be sweet so maybe be a little bit careful though about playing Tristana into maybe like a syndra who can knock you back maybe an Ari who can charm you mid-air these type of Champions on the whole guys I think she's gonna be Giga busted because the infinity edge news Spike the other mid lane or the last one to talk about if you don't want to play Casting Tristana Bex has to be mentioned because of those Cuba towards the end of season 12 it's on a four second cooldown a rank five level nine it's also dealing extra damage because the AP ratio got buffed as well and ever since that point Vex really hasn't been touched right she's remained as an S plus two champion in every single Lilo since those Buffs 13.1 B are you really going to be like affected by anything no so Vex has to be here for another patch now moving into the jungle just like the other roles three champions again so starting us off we have Echo now Echo is here because well I guess the bus to him like last season where he got a few but also guys I really just want to talk about how the jungle matter right Echo because the jungle meta is now more like kind of full query it lets you scale more like it's just more scary just how it is I guess because people just aren't invading people aren't putting pressure on the map they're more than happy just clearing all their camps because the crooks changes as well right so the big Krug only spawns little krugs now and Edco I just think it's solo queue he's the ultimate Champion right you have Mobility you have engage and escape with your W and your ultimate you're very slippery and your iron spikes are huge like when you actually get like rocket build or Nash's 250 going that build they just feel so good on it and his win rates in pretty much every single ELO are incredibly high so he has to be included just like Evelyn so if you don't want to play Echo the next best I think AP jungler in the game is Eve now why is Eve broken well not only did right buffer a few passes ago kind of like echo in a way just like echo in this sense the jungle changes right people like full clearing don't know why but they do well everyone I guess you kind of after full clear like you want to Champion until Level 4 that may be even level six so maybe you're a unique case but no one's invading you like bro just fall clear you'll be sweet so players are just letting you scale for free and a bit like Echo right solo queue is always going to be solo queue and Evelyn because of your invis because no one is going to put a pink in their lane or even like think about you because that's just what people don't do right like they don't have mini maps you can absolutely Crush players in pretty much every single ELO just make sure guys you do actually protect yourself in the early game so if you're starting at Red buff Ward your blue buff if you're starting a blue buff would your red buff protect yourself from getting invaded and you should be able to scale into a game and take over one more Champion guys if you don't want to play Echo or Evelyn in the jungle let's say you want to play well it's not even an attack damage champion this Champion is just all about utility really this being Zach now I know demonic Embraces are getting Nerf right so you're playing a demonic Embrace champion in 13.1 B you're not gonna be as strong but here's the thing for Zach get a radiant virtue that's all you need bro don't build any other items after that actually trust me like legit that's all you need to be a champion the end to actually carry team fights and games because raid in third sure it's enhancing you and your teammates of course on Zach when you go in to the enemy backline and use your ultimate you'll be bouncing about knocking them about your teammates coming bang bang and you win team fights right and we could talk about here like demonic and price yes okay it might affect your clear speed but as Zach like all you really need to do is hit Level probably four I'd say before you can actually start to make plays especially once you max out your elastic slingshot because the range is crazy right Zach I think it's solo queue as well it's just really forgiving even if you fall behind you're always going to have utility and be valuable and if you see a mobile Champions on the enemy team so you might see like syndra mid lane you might see a gen 80 carry Misfortune Draven they are going to get blown up and it's a really easy playstyle all you have to do is just go in land a queue maybe you're your ultimate and that's pretty much all you have to do tax win rate and every single ELO just like the other Champions I've mentioned is super high as well so he's included now moving down to the bot Lane kind of the big talking point for 13.1 B which ad carries rather gonna be busted well first of all I want to talk about Draven so Draven is really going to enjoy 13.1 B kind of like what I said for Jace maybe because you're getting ability Haze but from a Eclipse that is but I don't think it's going to mean that much but the real good talking point for driving is the essence Reaver buff right so you're getting 10 more attack damage for 100 more gold in the item so you're spending 2 900 for Essence reader but you're getting 10 more A.D A.D is draven's most important stat attack speed like you legit don't give a what's it about so this is a big actual like indirect buff to it also what you can do now because Infinity Edge remember is spiking off 40 crit so you want to get it as your second major item Essence Reaver into infinity edge for Draven trust me you will deal the most damage out of any champion in the game after two items like I actually don't think that's even like questionable so Draven if you don't have him in your champion pool yes he's difficult to learn and master again check out our website for all the videos and courses on him but you should definitely have him in your champion pool 4X patch another champion I think you should have in your champion pool for next passion who does well against Draven is Misfortune why well let's think about that Infinity Edge change again so 40 that means second major item right Misfortune so Kraken Slayer into Infinity Edge Misfortune you guys should be able to Envision and just feel the power out with this one because you're gonna be one shorting people remember as well Draven and Misfortune both of them their W's are attack speed steroids so any Champion right because you're dealing more damage who can actually deal even more damage because they have some sort of attack speed steroid like Tristana right who I mentioned I Draven bloodless like Misfortune with your strut oh my goodness me like it's gonna be very scary playing against not only will your attacks be dealing more damage but you'll be throwing more of these attacks out than any other 80 Carriage because you have that attack speed boost also remember with Misfortune the ultimate I mean right above this I can't remember when it was like early season 12 maybe season 11. they buff the actual like crit damage in your ultimate this is going to obviously like just be Amplified earlier in a game because that Infinity Edge bike is expediated now so Draven Misfortune the first 280 carries but let's say you don't want to play either of these you actually want to scale a little bit more maybe well twitch is like the other best ad carry I feel also think about twitch what do you have in common with Draven and Misfortune attack speeds steroid coming out of your Ambush now kind of the question for twitch is do you go blade of the ruined King because that's getting buffer range users so the actual damage is getting buffed by one percent now the cooldown and actual magic damage might get enough but you will easily be able to once your people still coming out of your stealth with blade of their own King the other option obviously is to go like crack and say into Infinity Edge right and for twitch I don't know what's going to be best maybe if you're a twitch man out there watching this you can let me know what build is going to be best but either already maybe if the enemy team has a bunch of tanks and HP you go bork but even crackers that does well against that stuff but yeah just the fact that twitch has an attack speed steroid I think he's going to throw off these changes as much as anyone so here's the final lady carry now the last role guys obviously the three supports we have to talk about and if you do enjoy these videos and want us to continue making them make sure to leave a like down below now the first of these supports if you want to actually just like 1v9 from level one onwards blitzcrank right because of the bus like last season where they buffed the actual damage the base damage in your rocket grab and also your ultimate so when level 6 comes around you one shot anyone like legit even if it's a tank you pull in you're one shot them with your ad carrying your team but also for blitzcrank what's popular in the bot Lane well people just love playing range Champions right in enchantresses like I can't really remember my last 20 games if I had a support who was like at Alistair or a Leona it's always the same right like Lulu Nami Janna you just see them all the time blitzcrank loves playing against them because they're immobile and squishy land one rocket grab they go boom so blitzcrank is the first support who I just think counters a lot now also we have Janna now Janna is a shielding support I get it that you have healing in your ultimate right for the most part you're just going to be using your EQ and W yeah so with these abilities because you don't have healing you're going to be largely unaffected in my opinion anyway by the Grievous wins bust right so if a support a tank supporter's building Bramble verse if like an ash support or a center has got an Executioner's calling or if an AP support has Oblivion orb early on it's not actually going to affect you too much also you can make use of the new chemtech putrify it's costing 200 less gold even though you might be losing ability power ability haste just a little bit you are getting actual eight percent Shield power and healing power which is great for Jenner especially after Moonstone ride so 4G and expatch I think you're gonna be even better and that's exactly the same for Lulu as well shielding supports because you don't have an a healing especially Lulu anyway I mean Janna does okay I get it but you're not like Sona or Soraka right it's only really with your ultimate but Lulu is actually kind of unique you don't have any healing so you're going to be completely undisturbed by the actual Grievous wins bucks and again just like I mentioned for Janna you can actually abuse these yourself against team compositions against supports against botlines who have healing in their systems so there were some super interesting changes here guys in 13.1 B those are the 15 most broken champions for this patch let me know down below once again what you think who's going to be the most broken champion who are my life now and who's going to be really broken did I miss someone let me know down below and until our next season 13 upload this is Phoenix foreign [Music] ","71":"yo what's up game we've been this is in today's video we're going to be talking about some of the changes that have been released already for patch 13.8 in yesterday's video guys we listed those changes The champ is getting buffed and nerfed and the item that's getting changed and we have those changes for you today and we're going to be getting into what they're gonna mean for the next patch of course what we're playing on at the moment 13.8 is the MSI patch so hopefully you guys are Keen for that but if you do actually want to take your game to the next level guys and get to MSI yourself I guarantee you can become a pro player by watching the content on our website made by Challenger players and coaches from around the world because we will teach you how to be a good League of Legends player if someone asks you how to play the game you can tell them exactly what it is to play like a challenger because we can teach you how to do it yourself applying the tips is so so easy we give it to you in such a simple easy to learn way we have championed courses we've got Champion guides we've got a bunch of like macro videos micro videos anything you want related to League of Legends summit's Rift we have it on thegamelit.com website link Down Below in the description and comment section so make sure you guys sign up to get exclusive access to the library content now the changes guys for 13.9 now there are only four in this video because that's all we know about at the moment now the first change is to one that's going to Ripple across the rift this being to Lich Bane now this item ever since they nerfed the damage not too long ago it really hasn't been like its former self in other seasons and that's just because other items like if you're thinking Shadow Flame or something right is probably more useful and lichmann just hasn't really been seen that much but for Champions who can use this item so if we talk about Champions maybe like Echo like Victor even other mid laners and Majors can use this like Ari for example Twisted Fate of course is a pretty popular one but yes for those Champions this is going to be better now because of the buff that's coming into 13.9 the buff is as follows the AP is increasing from 75 to 85. I try to be hyped about this guys I really did but it's not really the biggest buff it's pretty lackluster to be honest yes this is going to be nice for Victor I think especially TF this is better for Echo like all the Champs I mentioned but even in terms of gold efficiency it's not most efficient item unless you're like procking the Autos a lot so I don't really think it's going to change too much I think they could have done more here but yeah I guess little steps and yeah those Champions who are building this item they are going to be happier so yeah buffers are buff but I think it could have been more substantial now maybe one buff that might be substantial I mean honestly probably not but this change to jinx the Nerf coming into Jinx in 13.9 is this going to mean that she's no longer going to be the most OP ad carry in the game and for a champion who's picked like by far the most out of all the champions in the game to still be an S Plus 2 champion in every single Lilo and above like 51 winrance is this Nerf going to stop that so the Nerf is as follows your ad growth so the growth you're getting per level is going down from 3.4 to 3.15 so this means that as you start scaling into a game into the mid game into the late game you're getting less attack damage over the course of a game which affects your scaling and because you're an ad carry who cares about this this will affect your performance a hundred percent but it's not again kind of like the lichpane buff or the most substantial essential of hits here the fact you're still holding on to the attack speed buff from the start of season 13 or like whenever it was a few patches ago that's really like the strength of jinx at the moment and just the fact as well that you can get out of the laning phase at the moment because there really aren't that many scary lanes for you it just means that yeah you can get to the mid to late game you can get to Kraken Slayer Infinity Edge and I should probably also mention that the Critical Strike chance now from Infinity Edge or navory the fact that it's now procking the passive or 40 crit has even been amazing for Jinx because it accelerates that power Spike that would have come at three items it now comes with two items so you're scaling and yeah big Power spike is just earlier in a game so you're safer earlier in the game you're more powerful earlier in the game that's been huge so the ad growth Nerf that's gonna hit Jinx in 13.9 like you might feel this but again it's not the biggest value that's dropping in the world so I don't think it's going to be too bad a win rate will certainly drop but I don't think it's gonna knock her off that top pedestal really that much now another champion who's getting just one change in 13.9 this is one of the more versatile champions in the game because you could play her in the mid lane you can play her in the jungle this being Talia now fortalea in 13.9 the good thing about this Champion now is that you will be able to cast your ultimate if you had been dealing damage in the last 3 seconds which means you can be mid-fight and cast your ultimate because how it is at the moment you have to buy yourself time from dealing damage to actually be able to use your ultimate around the map so you could be like fighting the enemy champion in the mid lane as soon as you hit Level 6 on the 530 wave or you could be clearing the wave and as soon as you've done that with your Q you can press your ultimate to the enemy Red buff or use it to get to the dragonfly that's happening so it's just going to accelerate those plays and I think this is a really nice change I don't know how much it will mean in terms of win rate I mean we can't really predict anything right in terms of these changes but I think this would be really nice I just think it's a big almost like quality of life buff and I think to Leah means especially in the mid lane are really going to appreciate this but even in the jungle you could be like you know fade away your gromp so you're finishing your gromp as you're running into the boat River or top River and you use your ultimate as soon as your Q last hits the ground for you so you can alter the Top Lane to the dragons maybe if they're doing it and the bottling the Top Lane like wherever the enemy champion Czar you are just on the map quicker here so you can do two things at once in a way I think this is really nice and I'd love to actually know if there are any Talia Mains watching what do you think of this I think this is pretty juicy now the final changes guys we have lined up for 13.9 it's kind of a shame they didn't release more of them but it's the balance team and expecting them to like release all the changes it's just a bit too much effort for them right anyway the last champion to talk about here is a bit like Talia because he's very versatile you can play him in the mid lane maybe Top Lane although less popular these days you can play him as a support even AP carry bought Lane now for all you swaying Mains out there but all you Crow lovers this Champion is actually getting some legit bus so let's go through them and all of them by the way are to your queue so let's listen Cubase damage is increasing by five at each level your Q's AP ratio is increasing from 38 to 40 what does that mean so these two bus the base damage early game buff this is going to help your farming in the early game poking the enemy Champion especially if you can land your e onto them the AP ratio is more late game based because the more AP you get the more damage your Q is going to deal so as you site buying items this will be really effective in the late game and that's when Swain is at his best your Q's bonus space damage per bolt is increasing as well by three across the board and also the q's bonus AP ratio per bolt is increasing from 8 to 10 and I've heard a few Rumblings from the swaying community that this is actually a pretty good buff for this Champion what do you guys think like to any sway means watching what do you think about this should they above something else maybe like it's hailing from his ultimate because Graver twins are like pretty effective now and easy to buy should they buff something else in this kit should they have made these Buffs to his Q even better let me know your thoughts in the comment section but yeah this has beenings thank you so much for watching hopefully the changes all of them will get released soon and we can go through them together but yeah thank you so much for watching please leave a like on the video if you did enjoy it remember to hit that subscribe button so you don't miss our future season 13 uploads and yeah this has been it peace thank you ","72":"yeah what's going on game leapers this is eggs in today's video we're going to be talking about the 13.0 patch notes mate that got released today so the patch is out hope you guys are winning your games hope you guys aren't running it down and hope you guys are maybe abusing the ELO inflated Champions because of the Buffs that came into 13.8 and that's what we're going to be going through in this video guys we're just going to be going through the notes and trying to figure out if these changes actually change anything if the meta is going to stay the same all that stuff this is also the MSI patch so for those of you who will be watching MSI with your friends and you and your dad next year like maybe you guys can anticipate the teams and the players who are going to pop off because of the champions in the meta and yeah just before we get into it guys if you do want to improve this game like I'm talking tear clamps I'm talking at least division climbs please check out the website mate our Challenger players and coaches uploading daily content to the website these could be Champion courses guides macro guides anything you name it we've got everything under the sun mate on the website so join thousands of your fellow Summers get signed up to stop being bad at the game now patch highlights okay here we go 13.8 let's start by going through the champions in alphabetical order we have asil aurelian Soul bro like anyone who's played against this Champion if you don't kill him like five times before 20 minutes you're gonna lose the game I swear that's just how it feels it's so hard to get near it and if you don't one shot him which can be difficult against players you know who actually have their monitors turned on it is pretty impressive so Ryan nerfing this Champion is definitely legit but they have noticed his health growth and armor growth which yeah just means that he's going to be more one shotable and killable in the mid to late game this I think is nice because yes in the late game this does make him weaker I understand and you can like you know kill him more often I guess but making him more vulnerable in the laning phase means that you can't just like blind pick it because that's what I think like people are just doing now like there are definitely some hard counters to him right like Champions who can jump on him quick Gap closing champions for sure right but for the most part in the majority of videos you can just pick this guy and probably just scale for free so I don't really think this will actually do too much to aurelian Seoul again in the majority of reloads I still think he's going to be really good for 13.8 moving down to the bot Lane here we have Ezreal his base attack damage has increased so his attack damage going up by two means that in the early game laning phase he's going to be dealing more damage from his Auto attacks his Q using stuff right so in terms of like csing it will be easier in terms of putting out damage against the enemy Champions yeah this just means more damage right and this would definitely translate to kills and a bit more so yes this is actually quite a nice but for Ezreal and that's why he was in the beat here for a 13.880 carried tier list and moving to the Top Lane here kind of a similar buff honestly this is to Garen but he's also getting another buff on top of this one so the basic attack damage is increasing by three 66 to 69 weight and his base armor is increasing by two from 36 to 38. this means that for early game Garen in the Top Lane it makes you a lot better against melee Champions your trading potential right it's going to be enhanced because of these Buffs and you will definitely feel this so hopefully you can actually get to the mid to late game without well yeah just being like ahead I guess so Gareth early again this is a really nice buff but I still don't think you'll be able to compete with the best 12 players still now moving back down to the bomb Lane here we have Janna your W's damage is increasing so it's going up by 1080 drank the base damage that's also dealing more damage based off the amount of AP you have and because you're going shirelli isn't probably Putra fry or something you are going to actually feel this W damage With the Enemy Champions will but yeah this is actually really nice for Janna like it kind of makes her a little bit more obnoxious during the laning phase like an extra 10 damage means something if you're going something like Airy right and you even Max your W first now like that's actually a legit idea that's how you used to play Janna back in like bought season seven I think it was so that becomes more plausible and you've also got another buff here so you're either the storm The Shield you give your ally Champion or yourself The Shield Decay timer is going to be twice as long now which means they're gonna have that Shield yes for twice as long this is really useful and you of course or even a tower can have the shield so these are nice Buzz for Janna and she is maybe struggling at the moment because of all the engage I understand that in most dealers she does well still because yeah she scales really well and most games are gonna get to the late game but this is a legit buff particularly for those Janna players in higher levels of play and moving to the Jungle j4 your attack damage growth is decreasing that means that as the game progresses you're getting less attack damage this definitely matters you're going to be getting less kills and stuff also speaking of your damage your cues damage is decreasing so it's going down by 10 at each rank this is important for j4 in terms of clearing your cam skirmishing ganking fighting right less kills again you're an early game jungler for the most part so yeah this is definitely gonna hurt you his win rate is for sure going to do you careers now Kane shadow assassin Kane is getting nerfed as far as your Shadow step goes you're copying two nurse here so the bonus movement speed you get going down to 70 the cooldown is going up by 10 seconds now they originally had this at one second increase now it's a two second increase right so 10 second cooldown for your shadow assassin Shadow step so this means you've got to be a little bit more wary a little bit more careful of just coming at it terrain using your W and engaging on enemy Champions most of the time as well guys in the late game as this like blue cane you want to be staying in terrain so if the cooldown going up will mean something for sure as will the bonus movement speed but the playstyle will still stay the same and ever since they increased they gain scaling damage like a few patches ago towards the start of season 13. shadow assassin Kane has been really good and I still think he will be really good but yeah these are nerves for sure now kha'zix is kind of on the other end of the spectrum here getting one of the biggest Buffs I think of the patch your Cube's base damage is getting increased by 10 at each rank this also means that your isolated damage and is going up as well this is nuts for kha'zix this is pretty much like the essence of your Champion right your Taste Their Fear when you isolate an enemy Champion which is easier now because of the buff like last patch right from 13.7 this is going to hit art this is going to mean you're getting more kills right and if you can do so in the early game because you're going to be maxing this first as well so by level nine 170 base damage plus the isolation damage Champions are going to go boom bro like not many people are going to have armor by that point so as far as snowballing goes you might be one of the best jungles to actually do this in 13.8 so watch out for the Cockroach now another champion who looks like a cockroach kogmore your passive's true damage is increasing and also when you're in your pass if you will be ghosted so you can go through like minions and stuff right just like fizz can and your cues cooldown is also decreasing and your ease Mana course is decreasing and the slow is increasing so if you're playing AP kogmore congratulations most of these don't really mean too much and your passive damage increasing now you can ghost when you're in your passive uh it doesn't really do much for like the majority of a game right like yes when you die this is useful but if you're playing kogmore you shouldn't really be dying like too much I guess even though you probably are but um yeah you're just like sitting back right and farming so if it's not like really affecting your lane or your range or your DPS which really like none of these do I don't think like these bus are really going to change anything they kind of look Placebo to Me Maybe I'm Wrong tell me in the comments guys if I am a bunch of Buffs but not much juice I don't think Leona is getting buffed and these are actually like packing a bit of punch here so your W's armor and the magic resist you're getting this is increasing and the magic damage from your W is also increasing this means that as far as your all in goes not only are you tankier but you're dealing more damage as well an extra 10 base damage for your W this is legit like this puts you on par with Nautilus blitzcrank Pike these other engaged support so the Solari is back in business here now Lily are another champion beginning with the letter L don't even know why I said that it's like really not important but anyway yeah but lately this patch guys like they're a Buffs here right so your passive damage to monsters is increasing you're healing against Monsters increasing and against Champions well it's been adjusted but anyway what's really interesting for Lily this patch is Cosmic Drive Cosmic Drive is giving you so much movement speed now up to 20 if you deal with consistent damage and because you're really you will write with your cute this means if you've got Cosmic Drive in your build somewhere so something I don't know let's just say you go maybe what like demonic Embrace and a jack show Cosmic drive you could go leandra's anguish in the cosmic Drive which might be the go-to yeah this actually makes like Lily a good I think but the problem is is actually can you get there with these butts I think you will be able to more damage against Monsters and healing this is going to be useful so Lilia means you guys should be rejoicing now if I getting nerfed I don't think we have to really get into these changes your W because it got buffed so much at the start of the season right this getting nerfed here malphite's been the best top player ever really since those Buffs so wmax malphite watch out if you're going to do this in 13.8 because it is definitely worse off now nidalee another jungler getting some massive boss bass armor is increasing by four and your armor growth is increasing as well this makes you unkillable if you're playing against a team of attack damage Champions just build a zombies on top of this and it's like you're playing as a tank nidalee while still one-shotting everyone on the rift get me out this 100 will be banned like 50 in high reloads watch that space now another jungler and top laner who's getting buffed this is Poppy your Q's damage is increasing and the W bonus resistance is you get these are increasing as well these are nice for poppy all variations over also in the Top Lane because your Q is the only damaged based off the target Health damage this will be useful for all the tanks in there and the bonus resistances you get from your W now going up two percent or if you want to talk about it like relatively 20 this is also pretty fat now Ricard is getting nerfed as well guys it's kind of like the male fighter supports pick this guy in any game you're going to be sweet bass armor decreased armor growth decrease squisher in the early game squisher in the late game you're going to die more for sure because of these changes so you might have to be a little bit more careful and there was only one item guys that got changed and this was Cosmic tribe so like I mentioned for Lilia the AP is going up to 100 and also the spell dance passive you're getting this is going to generate a stack of movement speed up to four Stacks so at Max Stacks you're gonna get 10 and when you do get to Max tax you get another 10 on top of this so 20 of your movement speed in total this is like legit big but Champions like Vladimir Lily arrived so these low cooldown mid to late game Champions this is going to be huge now I don't actually know if it will make them broken because none of those Champions really are like super at the moment some of them might be good but we'll have to wait and see if it really pushes them into op territory guys that was the video thank you so much for watching this like little rundown of the 13.8 patch notes we will see you in tomorrow's 13.8 video thank you so much for watching I will see you then this has been eggs bye foreign ","73":"you guys actually want to know how to Jungle properly but look at this comment for me that I recently got right like this is just from an eight minute video I did what I'm gonna do for you today is probably around the same time and in the next eight minutes you're actually gonna know what Challenger jungler's thinking how they play been a lot of talk recently about the matter and how it's changing in terms of the Jungle because the experience from camps is going up you're now dealing actually the same damage to the enemy camps as you are your own which is good for jungling but I'm actually going to teach you in this video that regardless of what happens in terms of the Jungle meta this is actually how you should think when you go into your games so I know this is a jungle video but if you play mid lane Top Lane bot Lane you will also learn something from this because the concepts we talk about well you can apply them in your own lanes and by the way guys if you want access to videos just like this one that I'm making or our website and for our subscribers make sure you check out gamelib.com link Down Below in the description and comment section because yeah myself and other Challenger players and coaches are uploading daily content that is actually going to help you improve in this game and yeah without further Ado let's get into this game so first of all we're going to be looking at one of my students games so this is in around my Platinum na ELO and in this game he's playing Kindred against Diana now because Diana is really like a level 4 Champion yes at level three she can't do something at level 3 she's not the strongest in the world you can compare this to something like a Kane and Evelyn someone who typically does fall clear and you can actually do something because you're the stronger Champion so quite simply the question we're asking ourselves is can we actually invade this guy early on if the answer is yes to that question all you have to do is study or red buff clear krugs and Raptors to back in the day sometimes you could just go straight from your red buff into their gromp area and invade them but I actually just think it's a lot better now to go red krug's Raptors because krugs are so easy to take and they give you the most experience you want to put krugs and Raptors on a timer early on and that's exactly what this student does he goes Red Cross routers and then runs at the Diana's top side then there are a couple of little mistakes there the first one I want to point out is that Joey the student does not actually ping where the enemy jungler starts this should be the first like kind of point of communication I guess that you make in every single game like if I'm to coach you like if you don't ping where the enemy jungler starts you're trolling you're with only information from your teammates and in this game we can clearly tell the enemy jungler has probably started out their Red Bluff because kale is showing before the enemy bot Lane pretty simple stuff so far now if we fast forward a little bit here after Joey does this Raptor cap he knows that he's probably making this move into the enemy topside jungle but unfortunately he doesn't ping anything here there's no on the way ping and the enemy blue buff area this means that Cassiopeia this means the malphite to know this information they have to look at their map and guess what in the early game most of the time you're going to be so engrossed in what you're actually doing against your opponent that you won't have time to even look at the minimap and consider what your jungle is doing now another mistake here is that Joey does not look at mid lane so we don't know here if Yasuo is a free kill or not because we don't look at the mid lane and just a quick tip here like it's probably the case that Yasuo is on a similar HP to Cassiopeia so if you look above the minimab for me if your teammate is on kind of close to full HP the enemy Champion probably will be as well most of the time people are going to trade the same amount of HP that's just how it works but anyway Kendra decides to make this invade onto the top side which is still fine the use of the sweeper is great because you want to know before you invade an area if it's watered or not this way you can actually tell or not if the enemy team knows you're doing this now Kendra just queues over gets a little bit lucky with the timing but all this is just beautiful League of Legends and beautiful jungling because the Kindred player knows that she's stronger than paganator playing Diana now this is where Challenger junglers are going to separate themselves and maybe even like high Challenger junglers from everybody else now I want you guys to think here like what would you do so you've just killed the Diana you've taken her blue buff and her grandpa's Rider here your Smite is up kinda soon the enemy kale might be moving down towards you and if we also look in the game time as well it's 253 here now jungling at the highest level is all about knowing timings if you don't understand like what the time in the top right actually represents then you're not actually going to be able to play this role effectively the closest thing to spawning if we really like think about it is Scuttle crab right that's in about 35 seconds time 35 seconds you guys should just know that around 35 to 40 seconds is around the time you need for a recall and then to get back on the map close to the middle of the map this means the kindred should be thinking about hitting Diana somewhere where Diana might go why because she's stronger if you get a kill in the early game and you recall and you cash in those chips when you meet them again you'll 100 win now the next key step after like pressing recall is to think about where you can actually hit the enemy Champion so in this case the jungler right so if you're Elena you just walk back to Lane right easy but if you're a jungle you have to think about when the enemy's jungle is going to go now do you think Diana's gonna run to our top side here because the Diana is level 2 with 12 CS which means and it's kind of weird but this was on the old patch as well that she's done red Raptors and walls that means the diners krugs are up her blue Buffs up and her gromp is up but she knows that Kindred has a blue buff and is probably going to take a gromp because it's right here which is what Joey decides to do this is definitely correct like Grump is so close to this you're not gonna waste any time by actually taking this but after Joey takes a gromp and he should definitely Smite this by the way what is the actual killer move here because this is how you start a snowball and keep it going and going until it becomes like a new news Noble on TFT so the key move here is to recall which is kind of what we've alluded to so far right so what are we actually recalling for because this is all about tempo right I'm sure you guys have heard about this kind of like theory if there is time on the map or something then you want to recall for it bend your gold and then you can run to that thing right it might be like a baron at 20 minutes it might be a rift held at eight minutes it might be a Scuttle crab at 3 30. it could be 6 40. the first jungle buff that's gonna spawn again right these are timers that's what tempo is is there Tempo on the map right now yes there is for Scuttle craps now what Scuttle crab do you think Diana's going to run to is she going to run towards level 3 soon to be level 4 Kendra topside probably not right she's going to run to the bot Scuttle crap so what should Kendra do at a base well as she's recalling she should ping on the way to the bot Scuttle crab and then she should also ping Diana's Bonsai jungle because that's where she's probably going to be so that's also the process guys when you're actually recalling and doing some sort of tempo play like this now as we're watching this if you really don't believe me that this is how you should play I'm gonna show you the best genre in the world honestly in my opinion like the best player of all time like I think he's like better than them Faker I think he just transcends the jungle role so we're going to be watching a clip of Canyon playing Lee sin in high Challenger reload and we're going to watch what he does at around the same time when he gets a kill and an assist at level three okay now in this game because Joey doesn't recall he ends up face checking the Diana and he has to blow his flash how are you gonna blow your flash when you have this much of a gold lead after killing the Diana you're a level ahead with double bust but you're having to flash like we've made some sort of criminal mistake here it shouldn't be this difficult that's all it is pressing the B button for that Tempo play on the map now what does Canyon do in this game will he gets a kill and an assist in the ball Lane he recalls straight away now is there tempo for something Scuttle crap 330. now what crab are we going to go to well it's interesting here this is kind of like a unique situation but you have to understand guys the Canyon's bot Lane here has so much pressure the enemy Draven is very low HP the enemy Nautilus will be running back to Lane and there's nothing stopping the enemy jungler here the enemy at least from reganking his body the Varys doesn't have Summoner spells so if his bot Lane especially when they have a lead like this Bros their lead well it just makes the game infinitely more difficult and does canyon really care about his top side jungle or the topper is crogs probably not right like who cares you can take that at least no worries I'm gonna make sure my winning bot Lane wins even harder that's why he runs to the boat crab here and imagine if Elise was here ganking his ballet because his ball Lane is already winning the 2v2 canyon winning the jungle on top of that it means it's just an insta Giga win right so this is what tempo is guys this is the essence of it timing your vehicles for players on the map and it's not just Scuttle crab like I said before it could be Rift Herald it could be a dragon hopefully this makes sense any questions about it let me know in the comment section and if you do want more of these videos if this was really helpful let us know by leaving a like down below I'm not really sick of it but it is nice to not make a fast food macca's video every once in a while but guys thank you so much for watching this has been X see in the next video peace [Music] thank you ","74":"on November 10 2020 patch 10.23 was implemented into league and with it came the heavily anticipated item system rework fully reimagining a core part of the game's experience through a total overhaul of virtually every item in the shop along with introducing a new tier of items known as smithix items that were intended to be purchased early on that would shape how that champion will play out for the rest of the game many of us dove into this patch with some trepidation but the overall consensus toward the Mythic item system was positive since at the time the game was becoming exhaustively stale and it was high time for some major changes to take place to shake things up as players began to experiment with and enjoyed the new items and all the stuff that was introduced and or reworked it was discovered almost immediately that one category of mythics was performing significantly better than the others the tank Medics Sunfire Aegis turbo cam tank and frost are Gauntlet as always Riot was quick to hot fix them to be less overbearing slashing the damage numbers and supplementary effects while that was helpful in toning down the relative strength of tank mythics the better part of pre-season and early season 11 was characterized by the abuse of these tank items from Champions who were intended to build them and those who weren't it didn't take long until more definitive Nerfs were hammered on them effectively gutting the entire tank class for the majority of Seasons 11 and 12 before the durability update this wasn't the first time the tank last experienced a moment of Glory before being shut down altogether and it wasn't the last either just recently we experienced a surge of popularity once more thanks to two of the three new tank items Chuck shoulder protein and hard steel and in typical fashion these items received rather substantial Nerfs along with some of the beneficiaries suffering the same fate out of all the classes in this game tanks appeared to receive a disproportionately faster response towards any Summons of dominance preventing them from ever being able to find lasting relevance throughout the season while this is mostly a theory I believe this pattern of recurrence can be explained by looking back in time to a period where tanks had quite possibly the longest stretch of competitive dominance we've ever seen for today I want to go through the history of season 5 through 7's tank meta and how it cripples the tank class even to this day for those who might be a little confused as to what I mean by 10 thanks never being allowed to be relevant the ever-changing nature of League causes menace to shift every so often sometimes lasting three to four months half a year or in extreme cases an entire season for example the Mythic item system brought with it a stream of mini metas where one item was frequently exploited until it got nerfed we had the stride breaker meta the Moon Star renewer meta the turbo chem tank meta the gore Drinker meta stuff like that metasar of course not endemic to just items they can also be a class like a chander meta Bruiser meta assassin meta what have you or something even smaller like the teleport meta or kleptomancy meta ever since I would say season 10 metas never lasts more than 6 months at worst whenever something over performs the balance team tends to keep a close eye on things so as to prevent anything from becoming tier zero but that wasn't always the case if you were to ask anyone what their first memory of seasons 5 6 and 7 is there might be a few who talk about the class 2 works such as the Marksman Mage assassin Juggernaut update or some who mentioned the elemental dragons or plants maybe but the answer you'll likely receive the most is the infamous tank meta while I wouldn't say it ever achieved a tier zero status in the same fashion as to like so say art and sensor or Black Cleaver tank meta arguably had more significance from historical perspective mainly due to how long it lasted the fact is that Co less to form it in the first place and how president was through all levels of play from low ELO such as bronze silver and gold to the upper echelons of Master and Challenger and even in Pro play a quick search on YouTube for tank meta and you'll find videos after videos about tanks doing more damage than carries non-tang Champions going full tank and won't be in any games moments where top jungle support sometimes even mid laners going tank the list goes on and on it's almost become a meme where anytime there's an update buffing tanks or tank items players freak out about the possibility of another tank meta painting just how much impact it had on the game ever since then it's hard to pinpoint exactly when tank meta started but for me I would say it began in version 5.5 the jungle item Juggernaut was removed and replaced with cinderhulk the jungler's equivalent of Sunfire Gateway back when in its Inception the item costs a total of 2200 gold in exchange for granting 350 flat Health 25 bonus South and the usual Sunfire burning effect let that sink in for a moment 350 flat health is not a whole lot of things considered it's the 25 bonus solid that should catch your attention see by two items most tanks will have around 2500 HP back then so a quarter of that would mean 625 bonus health and then as you get your third fourth and fifth item that bonus would get even bigger so by 4 000 for a measly price of 2200 gold Center Hulk will grant you 1350 Health granted that's all it really did but this much health afforded the luxury of being able to itemize into dedicated tank items like frozen heart back then allowing for tanks to achieve monstrous amounts of durability this allowed for several junglers like sichuani Zach old Nunu gragasil want not to get really beefy and back then tanks used to have a lot of Base damage to account for them not getting any extra as time went on along with most if not all tanks having access to percent Health damage while non-tang Champions really did that was roughly where I would say we started tank meta but things came to a head at the beginning of season 6 where we would have access to the new Keystone masteries and with it grasp of the undying which is almost identical to the grasp of the Indian Keystone Rune we have right now this law of Tanks the ability to convert their health into meaningful damage so long as they remains in combat Tech meta was officially underway the bus to Sunfire keep in versions 5.22 6.1 and 6.3 made it an extremely gold efficient item and with iceborn gauntlet being reworked into an armor item giving 65 armor 20 CDR and a slow radius to scale with armor tanks now had access to a very solid two item power Spike that gave a huge amount of Health armor Mana cooldown reduction and most importantly damage the combination of grass from the undying iceborn spellblade passive and Sunfire or cinderholic's burning Aura gave tanks a massive upgrade in DPS without forfeiting any defense whatsoever throughout season 6 the Top Lane tanks like Shen poppy Nautilus maokai Tom kensha malphite would build those two items and begin to start tearing through adcs and bruises left and right they didn't necessarily One-Shot them but the sheer amount of survivability meant they would last through several rotations of their ability abilities since at the time tank shredding options were few and far between by the mid game once they got their hands on spare Visage it became virtually impossible to take these guys on unless you were playing someone who explicitly specialized in shutting down tanks like vayne or Fiora even then that's assuming they wouldn't kill you first very very close game of TSM are eking these small edges [Applause] most junglers also defaulted to going full tank as well taking advantage of Cinder Hulk combined with the new tank items like dead man's plate to serve as auxiliary frontliners even bruises like rek'sai Olaf and Lee sin would run full tank interestingly tank meta persisted all the way through season 6 without any significant Nerfs iceborn lost a bit of Effectiveness in 6.4 and 6.8 but not enough to hinder its efficiency Sunfire Cape basically got away with murder only gaining a 200 higher gold cost otherwise that's how things ran he became so prominent that you would see assassins and skirmishers Dabble in this as well Fizz Echo nidalee and akali were frequent bandwagoners and Sunfire iceborn and in solo queue you would see random Champions Go full tank because they could with that much durability and healing you could just sit back and let your base damage plus Sunfire plus iceborn plus grasp do all the work seeing as how tanks were ultimately still reliant on carries to back them up right didn't see them as to Troublesome so aside from a couple slaps on the wrist for the ones who were enjoying tank meta too much none of the tanks were penalized all too badly it's the non-tanks that needed to be addressed like Echo and fist fortunately the Assassin update coincided with pre-season 7 which worked out nicely placing the spotlight on the newfangled deji boys and girls running a mug on the rift but what ended up happening is that it took attention away from tanks who were still performing extremely well not just the Assassin update the classified reworks for Mark Zone in pre-season 6 and the mid-season update reworking Mages in season 6 followed by the Assassin update in pre-season 7 made it so that there was always something else going on obviously with the contentious reputation assassins have they would most definitely be the target of everyone's animosity although one could say it was a worthwhile trade-off if it meant you no longer had to do what the Khali Fizz Echo and Italy running you down while being Invincible tanks were still a large though both the Champions and items there were three key reasons behind tank meta being such a disturbance for players the first was the items back then tank items were to all purpose if you look at tank items now they're purposely specified to address something you took thornmail for healers or rapid Auto attackers random Institute for crit damage boosters Spearfish that you took for increased sealing and shielding force of nature took fiber magic damage teams tank items back in season 6 and 7 however were far more General granted they still had their own distinct functions but take Spirit visits for example right now it has 450 Health 10 ability haste 100 health regen bonus and 50 magic resists during season six it had 500 health 55 magic assist 10 CDR and 200 Health regeneration which would become 250 thanks to its own 25 healing amp it didn't boost the power of shields back then but even for tanks who didn't have any healing the base stats were just phenomenal so we had 50 Mr versus 55 10 and bloody haste versus 10 CDR 450 Health versus 500 100 of the regen versus 200 current Visage is 2900 gold Visage back then was 28. of course current Visage made suffer that by also boosting shielding power as well as healing but that's if your Champion has people healing and shielding this applied to every other tank item as well Sunfire G500 health and 50 armor random Escape 500 health and 60 armor every tank item back then was useful for a broad range of situations because more value was tied to the base stats not so much the passives although they did matter second tank busting measures were few and far between a lot less percent Health damage true damage and armor shred in terms of Champions and items I touched on this in my toxic metas video a while back but did you guys notice how ever since around season 6 when tank meta started there's been a lot more percent Health damage and true damage coming in Jin was the first champion in season 6 and his passive does missing Health then we have kled who does Max Health Camille who does percent health and true damage came with percent Health if he goes red form born with percentile damage so it would true damage kaiso would present missing Health Pikes is an execute which is basically true damage I don't think the increase in frequency was coincidental not only that but they brought in a lot of new tank busting items thereafter which became even more plentiful following the Mythic item systems were also adjusted to be more anti-tank for example we have the cut down Rune which is designed to do with tanks conqueror also used to convert a portion of damage dealt into true damage they actually reverted that change purely because tanks were getting absolutely demolished by anyone who ran it third tanks were just broken like actually broken you look at the base damage and effects they had back in the day compared to now it's almost insane how strong they were back then that may sound extremely strange considering how much damage tanks are doing right now but the relativity was more noticeable presently tanks are doing a metric ton of damage because that was a response to there being too much damage so they had to make tanks deal a lot of damage otherwise it would all suck back then however base damage on every class was quite low while in tanks they were decently high you'll notice how Champions like gragas and maokai used to run full tank whereas now they go full AP Riot slashed a lot of their base numbers and pumped up their AP ratios to incentivize plays to go AP on them so overall it was a combination of overpowered items lack of countermeasures and a bigger disparity in base parameters that made tanks the reigning class so long in fairness though Seasons 5-7 was a huge turning point for league ushering in a new era of the game through class updates Champion reworks new Champions and whatnot as a result many of us assumed this was merely Growing Pains that ride had to work out but things reached an all-time breaking point when orn was released as he fully highlighted all of the aforementioned factors behind the absurdity of tank Meta Even though the concept of 200 years didn't come out until a few years later orn was likely the first instance of a champion that personified the 200 years meme because Oren the Mage death knight Paladin Hunter Rogue Warrior enchanter tank Cruiser wizard warlock priests assassin Gunslinger Drew with Shaman Necromancer dementia Gunslinger barred monk robot Condor blacksmith Mystic Warden God Illusionist Templar wizard was able to take up so much damage and give Dragon X the opening that they needed exaggerated of course but then again Oren had damage tankiness crowd control engaged peel dueling potential burst trades all in its waveclear neutral game sustained split pushing team fights he was so overloaded it was inconceivable as to how he made it to Life's surface without someone giving it a second thought Horn's Elise also took place shortly after the mid-season 7 Vanguard update placing heavy emphasis on maokai Zak and sejuani despite all the videos memes clips and discourse about tanks they were still flying under the radar at least until that point from then on the damage meta we've been in ever since came to be tanks got nerfed tank items got nerved damage items were above to carry Champions were buffed more Champions with inherent tank busting came out and the rest is history attempts have been made in the past to try and bring tanks back into meta relevance but if and when they happened it will last for all but a momentary spark while bruisers Mages or assassins have enjoyed long stretches of dominance tanks whether as a class or individuals would barely make it through one month before ultimately getting shut down there will never be another period where a large group of tanks are in control of the meta perhaps one or two might have some fun but never will we experienced during 2015 to 2017 the tolerance of this kind of gameplay environment runs on such a shorter fuse nowadays and sentiment towards the philosophy if you use a bit of a mixed bag the benefit of long lasting metas back then was that it offered some semblance of permanence as in it was worth investing time into X and Y Champion since one could assume that champion would be strong for quite some time moreover provided I remember correctly the ensuing consequences were arguably far more toxic in terms of experience sure many players were frustrated that tanks were extremely difficult to stop but the side effect of that was games were slower mistakes made early on weren't as much deciding as they are now furthermore because of the sheer over inflation of damage tanks are even more absurdly overstated now than they were before and still getting shredded to bits depending on the team composition tanks were too tanky so they made tank busting options more plentiful but then there was too much damage so they tried to make tanks extra tanky to compensate with the thing about tank busting is it doesn't matter how tanky those Champions get tank busting is still tank busting leaving only one option increasing the amount of damage tanks can do through set items to compete with carries but if tank items do a lot of damage on top of being durable that poses the risk of non-tang Champions abusing them basically you're stuck in a catch-22 if you make tanks strong they inadvertently make other Champions strong as well but if you make tanks weak no one wants to play them even if you opted for a more durability focused approach to items and systems like how they deal with the new Mythic items they will never be contained within the tank class everyone who can abuse them will abuse them because in League the best offense is a strong defense the longer you stay alive the more damage you'll do the more ability your rotations you'll go through so on and so forth season 5 through 7's tank meta is why the tank class is permanently crippled they may have a few weeks of prominence every now and then but I have a feeling we're never going to leave the fighters slay a mage hybrid carry meta the alternative would just be way worse that being said I really do miss tank meta not because I play text not entirely anyway I just feel like games were more stable back then we didn't have teams full of 1v9 Champions e going over who has the biggest dicks I know your type driven the kind of man who's compensated for something yeah I hope this was insightful for you guys a bit of a different video than what it would normally make but I had a fun time writing this if you enjoyed as well it would be awesome if you could leave a like And subscribe to the channel really helps me out also follow me on Twitter at vars firm join my Discord server and check out my video on toxic matters if you want some more history type content but till next time thanks so much for watching and I'll see you again soon in the next one take care foreign [Music] ","75":"hey what's going on game leapers this is easy and in today's video we're going to be talking about the 10 of most broken builds these are the most OP setups you can run in the game in 1223 at the moment and some of these by the way are kind of going to be like unknown so I'm trying to give them a little bit of love in this video so yeah if you guys want to test them out or if you do actually play with these at the moment then let us know in the comment section if you do want to become even better if you do want to peek on the rift then please check out our websitegameleep.com Linked In the description and comment section because that will actually help you improve and become better it doesn't even matter what you build on Champions you will be stomping 99 of the player base because you played the highest level so to get access to our library of content where we upload daily videos click on those links and yeah let's get in to the countdown now coming in at number 10 is a zillion mid setup and you might be like why would I want to play zillion in the mid lane well let's think about who's op at the moment right in terms of Champions on the rift well we have Champions like Bob we have a lot of bruises and Fighters right from the top point maybe building ravenous Hydra so if we think of Fiora Camille and of course there are a bunch of others now when you have zillion in the mid lane most games you're probably going to have one of these big carries on your team so why would zillion be good in these compositions where you enhance your teammates you make them even stronger and zillion in the mid lane with the new Rod of Ages and then with an archangel staff and then calls me try for all of that cooldown reduction the ability Haze is an excellent utility setup you're a very good wave clear because the AP from rower and Archangels and because of your ability to enhance their movement speed and of course to keep them alive with your ultimate zillion honestly is an excellent pick very good Flex pick as well so if you see him in champ select he might be going mid lane he might be going support so it's hard to actually predict where he's going as well so zillion mid with these three items very underrated and starts off the countdown now coming in at number nine you could probably assign these three items play to the Rune King still Caps or Merc Treads depending on the enemy team composition and then Jack show to a bunch of Champions right but specifically here guys I'm talking about Warwick so across every single rank right and over nine and a half thousand matches close to a 56 win rate Warwick with the hot picks birth Jack show so from 12 22 the whole fix in that patch well it hasn't been nerfed since so therefore Champions building Jack show are just as good right and because Warwick benefits so much from this item it just makes him 10K right as the fights progress and because of your innate healing Warwick is almost impossible to 1v1 and even in team fights he's very difficult to kill because of Jack Show's passive right so the longer the fight goes the more tanky you become blade of the Rune King will give you all the damage and obviously life still you need all the DPS and then by going steel caps or merches depending on the enemy team composition so this setup goes for Warwick in the jungle test this out and be scared if you see this on the enemy team now coming in at number eight on the countdown we have another jungler here now let's just say you don't want to play a jack show maybe tankier Champion let's say you want to play an assassin or how about playing kha'zix with this setup so these stats are in Platinum and above and you can see that when kha'zix players go ravenous Hydra prowler's core and then for your third item you can go a bunch of things right if the enemy team had zero armor you can go ghostblade you can get maybe Edge unite but if they have armor and you need to get through that tankiness serulu's Grudge is really good as well but the first two items Hydra and then Prowler score reason you want to get hired is because of the actual clean passive right and the help it gives you in clearing jungle caps kha'zix's big weakness ever since right kind of like just Nerf tier Matt a few seasons ago has been his clear speed right in the jungle especially with the multiple monster caps so we're talking walls Raptors and then krugs kha'zix does have a bit of trouble getting through them Tiamat and then Hydra allows you to clear as quick as the quickest jungles in the game now and because a lot of the players in this new Jungle meta are just full clearing non-stop just brain dead full clearing they don't even think about getting invaded cars and Q can do the same and you get to level 4 and you can actually play the game so any cars explains let me know if you've actually tried this setup and if you haven't highly recommend doing so now beating this setup to number seven on the countdown This one belongs in the mid lane again and this is Talon now it looks a little strange right because we don't have prowler's claw there's no lethality here but getting ravenous Hydra into Black Cleaver and of course I'm about to explain why and then Jack show well it's one of the most obnoxious setups on the rift now the reason we get a hydra what do we think I kind of just mentioned it for kha'zix in terms of jungling but in terms of laning the cleave passive here Matt bravenous Hydra the wave clear is awesome now Talon you do actually have good wave clear right with your W your rake but unfortunately sometimes you're not going to actually be able to one shot the back range minions and you won't actually have the damage maybe to outpush the enemy mid laner tmat and then ravenous Hydra allows you to do just this it's also really useful as well just to clear jungle camps while you're running to a lane or running back to mid lane or after you've shot the wave out you don't always have to go around the map killing people so this is super useful now Black Cleaver why do we get this well let's have a thing Black Cleaver we're getting this because it makes us a little bit more durable because the HP but we're really getting it for the armor penetration right so the longer the fight goes it's almost like we're playing Bruiser Talon in kind of a way but Black Cleaver lets us shred those tanks and because so many champions right have armor these days still caps the new Jack show it can be difficult to play against these op dps's at the moment Cleaver allows us to do that and the massive ability hates we get as well from the item so valuable now Jack show why do we get this not something like dustblade or power school you don't need dust play you don't need prayerless core you will still easily do enough damage to kill squishy Champions if you combo properly that is so maybe go on to our website and look at some of the talent guides we have so we don't actually need more damage that's why Jack show is so good right and just like I mentioned for Warwick the item that makes us tankier the longer the flight goes we're a close range melee Champion most of the time we are going to be near lots of enemy Champions so we can make full use out of this Mythic item now moving on to number six on the countdown guys we're actually going back to the Jungle here and this is one of the most interesting setups in the game at the moment so listen to this what we're going to be doing or what you guys should be doing is going radiant virtue Zack and you might be like why now could I do this and not go something like maybe frostfire or maybe even Jack show Zach there might even be heart Stills ax out there well the reason being is because of the buffed up radiant virtue got right so the fact that the passive is going to enhance you and your ally Champions it's so valuable right your ultimate is a massive thing on Zach of course and when you pop this you've become such a big threat as do your allies right and by pairing this with the Buff's unfair ages from 1223 so the cost went down by 100 gold 2700 total and also you're getting a big 100 extra HP huge right for Zach and then we can actually make use of all of this HP so from virtue from Sunfire with a demonic Embrace fight this demonic Embrace fire because of the passive it's going to translate all of that bonus HP we have from our previous two items into AP so not only are we a threat in terms of CC just innately speaking I mean we are playing zag but also in terms of damage if you can land a combo onto an enemy Champion they will 100 get a half HP I mean unless they're actually like really tanky but you get my point right you jump into the enemy backline with this build you're going to deal damage you're going to be unkillable and your team will clean house because of the virtue passive so Zach with this setup in the jungle definitely give this a shot guys in your games now moving on to Number Five Guys on the countdown you could easily put this as like the number one build just because the champion is so broken so this is belvith now with platinum and above if you look at this hit so in only 38 games right you might be thinking what a rubber star ball space like how can you talk about this and give it validity well the reason being is because 38 games are still decent enough but I've also got stats from diamond and above as well now in Platinum and above blade of the room King hard steel Titanic Hydra Belvedere has a 68 win rate if we move to Diamond and above this changes to 85 in 26 games this is no joke if the build was bad right and it was a flog of the build it's not going to have these win rates this is real and if it was pill more I guarantee you it would easily have a plus 60 plus 65 win rate the reason it's not built is because people love going crack and Slayer or they might go borking the Jack show they don't understand how op Hearts deal with Titanic Archer is but I've mentioned this for other Champions like set and the reason why it's so op is because you're getting so much HP from hard steel right what does that HP do when you have Titanic Hydra it gets transferred into bonus attack damage so exactly the same as demonic Embrace but the attack damage iteration right so with belveph because you already have blade of the Rune King you have all the DPS all the damage you ever need all the sustain then you get hard still it becomes even worse for the enemy team that is to actually kill you then you get Titanic Hydra you get even more HP and you get a bunch of bonus attack damage now so this build your own killable while the enemy Champions are still so killable now number four on the countdownload look at these stats plan and above like thornmail played as steel caps and Jack show a 60 win rate or close to for ramus in the jungle there's no way now the reason why ramus is so busted at the moment well it's kind of related to what I said before right think of all the Champions who were broken we have close range attack damage Champions bruises and that's good for ramus obviously because he is the ultimate anti-attack damage Champion so by getting an early thornmail into still caps into Jack show you become the biggest threat on the rift and because of the moment jungles have full clearing it actually gives you time to clear yourself not often are you getting invaded the moment because how people are just thinking about the jungle still think it's really bad but that's how players are playing Ceramics you can get to level three maybe even level 4 and then you can Power Ball around the map and become an absolute Menace and by the way Guys these stats even in high reload so in like master and above ramus's win rate is still close to 55 so it is real this is not just for lower elos even if you're playing in high reloads test this out they're coming in at number three on the countdown we are moving to the mid lane here and we're talking about Catherine and because of the bus in 12 23 it's not really about the build honestly even though this is a builds video it's more just about the cassadin getting buffed in 1223 has made this build incredibly broken right so Rod of Ages sorcery shoes Archangel stuff with the New Castle because of those Buffs in 1223 I just got to put him in here so if you're a mid laner and you don't have kassadin in your champion pool you are really missing a trick like we talked about Belvedere being ELO inflated this one kassadin with this setup it might be even better so if he is open and the enemy team has a lot of magic damage a lot of Mages you will crush them now number two who can be better than that setup if kassin is only number three well this is actually zerry with ravenous Hydra followed by Shield bow and then run on Tower okay now why are we going ravenous Hydra on Ziri well even though ravenous Hydra did get nerfed in 1223 right in terms of the cleave passive the actual damage going down by five percent for range Champions which obviously affects Zary and of course we're missing some omnivat once our carnivorous passive is fully stacked but who really cares about that because we're still getting 10 flat from the actual item once we buy it and the clear passive still deals enough damage to pose a threat right Zary it's insane because it helps with your kind of bad wave clear and your AOE once you get your e going and you start running around the map and stacking everything you deal so much damage and in team fights your damage output is easily going to be the most out of any Champion obviously the only bad thing here is that well it probably takes a little bit of time to scale but that's Siri anyway like even if you rush a shield bro you're still not really that strong you need two to three items to really become zaryan an actual champion so why not make it these three items and it's also really fun as well and any remains out there I'd love to know what you guys think if you have tried this setup because I might have to it actually looks that enjoyable now the number one build guys I'm 100 sure that anyone watching this video has seen this build in like the last few days this is uder now I'm not talking like Udu with conqueror or something like this phase rush or anything else like any other Keystone I'm talking about Halo blade suda with parallel's core and ravenous Hydra has anyone played against this by the way like legit it doesn't matter if you're playing a tank with a bunch of armor or a squishy obviously you just get one shot the TPS is like unreal as soon as he jumps on you with the tiger Stars oh my goodness like helper just disappears now the only bad thing about this build is that you're very squishy right so you do have to be careful about like just jumping in there like if you're trading your life for a maybe support probably not good right so you have to try and isolate enemy Champions and kill them when they don't have anyone else around them but even if that's like the only bad thing look at the win rate for me close to 58 that's in over 21 000 matches across all elos guys how can I not put this Builder number one so for those of you complaining about sample space Maybe for like the build F build or maybe a couple of others look at this one for me the number one build for 1223 is Halo Blade zoodle with Prowler score that was the stupidly OP 10 build countdown video for 1223 any questions any thoughts leave them in the comment section and if you did enjoy this video leave a like down below and I'll see you in the next video this has been foreign ","76":"crit Graves is back in meta and there's a very unique build the Koreans are spamming LeBlanc has always been predominantly played as a mid laner but the Koreans have been loving her in a different role we've got all this and much more to cover in today's video as we break down 10 of the craziest new Korean builds that have been popping up in solo queue but before we get into it be sure to check out skill cap if you want to truly get better at League of Legends we're the only service that offers a money-back guarantee if you don't climb at least five divisions while actively using our service we do this because our service really does work and if it doesn't work for you you shouldn't pay learn more at the end of this video or click the link in the description below starting things off with a couple of Top Lane builds nasher's Nico has been on the rise in recent patches it's currently heavily outperforming rocket belt and Kraken Slayer which are the two other popular Rush items for Top Lane Nico and that's right you're actually going to be rushing the nashers as it's a really great pickup thanks to its Buffs from a few patches back it's actually the exact same two item core that we see on AP verus as you are going to be building a riftmaker second item by going for a w Max first it has great Synergy with the nashers rush being able to deal a significant amount of consistent DPS you've also got a solid amount of burst potential as well so the build is really the best of both worlds for Nico as for the room page you'll want to grab lethal tempos the Keystone Rune with Triumph alacrity and Last Stand the optimal secondaries are bone plating and overgrowth jock show and stride breaker are by far the most popular Mythic items for Olaf but one that many pro players prioritize and are seeing great success with is radiant virtue jock show works really well for those extended drawn out fights however radiant is going to offer you much more upfront power if you're playing against majority squishy Champions who you can mow down before the jock show passive will even fully kick in going radiant is just going to be better value into a tank matchup where you're going to need a much longer fight to take them out going jock show would be ideal definitely look to adjust to each game and realize that radiant virtue is a super strong option in the correct spots you still want to rush the ravenous Hydra and then transition into radiant virtue as a second purchase third item death stance works great for most games Rune page consists of conquer with Triumph alacrity and Last Stand roll with biscuits and approach velocity for secondaries the Koreans love their aggressive playstyle so it's honestly not much of a surprise that they have started spamming gale force graves in solo queue gale force is still not as popular as Shield bow but it's played significantly more in Korea than in Western regions n a Graves players are only running gale force in two percent of games while the pick rate in Korea is 12 gale force actually has the highest win rate for any Mythic item right now on graves so it's definitely a very sleeper build when you factor in the mobility from graves e combined with the dash from gale force the outplay and burst potential with this setup is super nuts in matchups where the enemy is heavily skill shot Reliant you can get a lot more out of gale force than Shield bow vice versa though if the enemy has a lot of point-and-click unavoidable damage Shield bow is better value most of the time it's all out one shot with the two item core as you go gale force into the collector second for runes its Fleet footwork as the Keystone followed by Triumph alacrity and coup de gras grab magical Footwear and Cosmic insight for secondaries Korean Ivan players have decided to spice down things up in recent patches dropping Airy and running a Chad dark Harvest Rune page although this setup may seem a little troll we never promote setups that don't actually have valid data to back them up and this dark Harvest page is actually winning more than Airy in solo queue when you're skirmishing with ivern there are many ways for you to consistently proc dark Harvest through Daisy and throwing your e on a carry as a jungler who wants to gank a ton in the early game as well is not all that difficult to acquire a bunch of stacks early on for the complete Rune page it's dark Harvest with cheap shot zombie Ward and Relentless Hunter Nimbus cloak and Transcendence are the secondaries now you might be thinking if we're going dark Harvest ivern does this mean there is some full AP build to complement it surprisingly no as Korean iverns are still building him the exact same way with shiralia's chemtech putrifier and Redemption being the standard three item core you still want to be playing ivern as that utility Champion but with some added Flair and Solo Carry power from the dark Harvest over the past patch a new Kiana build has been on the rise over in Korea and it's a bit of an assassin Bruiser mix you're still going to to rush prowler's claw that's a staple on Kiana but instead of going ghostblade it's Black Cleaver that the Koreans have started building way more Cleaver actually holds the highest win rate for any second purchase on Kiana this build works really well when you're playing into comps that you can't reliably One-Shot if the enemy team has a tank top Lane and jungle building Black Cleaver will provide much more value for mid to late game fights it's not just the build that is unique though as conqueror is being run for the Keystone Rune instead of electrocute with Black Cleaver and conqueror you have a lot more extended fight power with this setup secondary runes are quite interesting as well with Koreans prioritizing the minion dematerializer a build gaining a ton more traction over in Korea recently and currently azir's highest win rate setup consists of crown for the Mythic item showmaker has been running this one in solo queue and he's even taken things a step further with the uniqueness of the setup crown and nashers are the two core damage items and from then on out showmaker ended up building full tank frozen heart was his third purchase and gargoyle Stone played after that to back up the legitimacy of this setup Crown is currently winning a whole four percent more than loudon's early entries this build is quite literally turning azir into a champion that is not completely terrible anymore due to all the recent azir changes so much of his power Now lies in his W instead of his Q if you haven't been following the recent changes you actually want to be maxing W out first now instead of Q you need to be constantly autoing the W to make a zero work which is why this more defensive build works extremely well allowing his ear to survive better in those extended fights in regards to the Rune page lethal Tempo is the optimal Keystone with presence of Mind alacrity and coup de gras Second Wind in overgrowth are what show maker is running for secondaries lethality Misfortune has been making a comeback over in Korea the past patch and it's actually a no Mythic setup Rush item is ghostblade second purchase is axiomark and you round it out with a manamune third this setup is all about maximizing mf's ultimate power Axiom Arc reduces 20 of your ultimate's total cooldown when a champion dies within three seconds of you damaging them the mobility from ghostblade is super nice to help you position optimally and find good angles for those multi-man ultimates even though this is at least reality setup you still want to be maxing Q out first in previous iterations of lethality MF and Emax was a thing but it was just nerfed too hard for it to be viable again Rune page however will differ from crit as you want to take Comet for the Keystone Rune with manaflow absolute focus and Scorch magical Footwear and biscuits are for secondaries with kog'maw being buffed for 13.8 there is a build going around in Korea that you would never expect and it consists of radiant virtue for the Mythic item these tank variations have always been a thing for kog'maw and he really only needs two core damage items to Be an Effective damage Source the first two items in this build path are rage blade and Wit's End radiant is purchased third and it gives kog'maw some really nice durability in those late game fights Cog R when used alone for poke doesn't really do a whole lot when you're playing him A.D for this reason you'll want to hold on to your R and only use it when a team fight is about to break out this way you gain the extra health and buff up teammates healing when you actually need it it's definitely something that you will have to be cognizant of after picking up the items because you won't want to Pop R to kill a minion or look for random Oak Rune page to run consists of lethal Tempo with Triumph bloodline and Last Stand conditioning and overgrowth are the way to go for secondaries over the past few patches the play rate of leblanc's support has been steadily on the rise over in Korea and it's actually winning at a solid rate as well the way you build and level your skills differs drastically from what we're used to seeing on LeBlanc mid for the build it's a night Harvester Rush with Shadow flame second and wardstone third don't Max W out first in leblanc's support as a q Max is how you're going to be most effective the Poke from Q is what gives leblanc's support a lot of power especially when laning against melee supports cooldown of the spell is only 6 seconds which is quite low for harassability just for comparison a strong laning support like Karma has 9 second cooldown on her Q at rank 1. leblanc's Q is even point-and-click as well so there's no way for you to mess up Landing the Poke the Rune page High ELO LeBlanc support players are seeing the most success with is dark Harvest followed by Sudden Impact zombie Ward and Relentless Hunter Nimbus cloak and Scorch are the best secondaries and our final build to round out today's video is a new one picking up some traction on Zyra recently a few patches back the play rate of Imperial mandate was nearly non-existent on the champ being played in less than two percent of games fast forward to now and that number has tripled as about six percent of Korean zyres are building Imperial mandate another very important item you need to be purchasing in order to make this setup work is rylies the passive from mandate can only be procked when you slow or immobilize a Target and with rylies it guarantees you'll be procing its passive even if you miss your e-root Zyra having so much consistent damage Potential from her plants allows her to proc mandate off cooldown very reliably it's also a much cheaper two-item Spike which allows you to be a bit more impactful earlier on in the game comet is the Keystone Rune with manaflow Transcendence and Scorch grab Taste of blood and Relentless Hunter for secondaries alright guys before we wrap this up let's tell you a little more about skill cap so we offer a five division rank up guarantee and think that's a pretty crazy thing to offer it's like a gym membership guaranteeing you'll get ripped your local gym would go bust if they offered that right not us we've offered this for years because our service really does does work it works so well in fact that we're able to produce by far the largest catalog of Premium League guides on the internet we had over 20 videos a week with over 1600 guides curated into over 100 courses no one can compare we've also sent Challenger players into ELO hell's 714 times and Counting where they commentate how to carry live they also respond to all questions asked sign up today for as little as 6.99 a month if you are serious about improving so there you have it guys 10 new builds being played over in Korea that you can look to abuse for patch 13.8 thank you all so much for watching good luck on the rift and we'll see in the next one ","77":"if you were a good jungler a few patches ago well surprise you aren't anymore at least not yet probably Riot loves to change the jungle and make us relearn it every single year but this time we essentially got a complete rework three times in the span of a few months it really seems like they can't make up their minds about how they want the world to be balanced but to be fair I can't blame them I don't really know what the solution is either at the very least we can teach you all how to get a read on the meta and actually adapt to these changes and any further ones that will inevitably happen down the line but before we get to that let's actually address the problem with the old jungle meta and what Riot is doing and has done to try and fix it basically jungle was almost impossible to get a lead in it wasn't so much that you couldn't establish lead in the first place but it would essentially evaporate the second you looked away for even a second we can find many situations where you would expect one player to be getting absolutely stoned for example this game with graves vs Warwick Graves is over double Warwick Cs and has over four times in kill participation by any metric of success he's hard winning but just look at the levels they're literally the exact same I don't think it's unreasonable to say that this feels terrible for jungler there's absolutely no shortage of examples of this exact kind of thing happening either and I feel like I speak for all players when I say that if you get ahead you deserve to feel like you actually are outplaying your opponent the entire game only to constantly be the same level is pretty disheartening and not great for player satisfaction or any playstyle that wants to play for individual agency in the past we've had General metas where it was hard gated by your clear speed camps would respawn quickly and in order to keep Pace you would have to be able to farm gank simply would not give you enough XP when compared to someone that was just power farming their camps and if you fell behind you would never catch up Pro players really do try to do the most efficient thing for the meta and even metas where ganking junglers would find great success in solo queue they would likely just be full clearing in Pro even on the same Champs like Jarvan that had decks the reason for this is that ganks just had way too much risk and simply not enough payout Pro players really just wouldn't die to ganks very often since both junglers were tracking each other well and vision was coordinated anyone that went to go for an early gank was essentially just throwing a Hail Mary it wasn't consistent at all to early gank at least not at the pro level but this year something has really shifted making Pro play look a lot more like solo queue let's take for example this one full night of lck games all of them were played back to back so we're not cherry-picking any examples here in every single game at least one of the junglers rushed level 3 and just ran around whether it was to invade gank a lane or in the most egregious case just sit around and wait for a crab to spawn in all of these cases they could have been doing camps but simply didn't care to not because they're making mistakes but because it just didn't matter all that much if they farmed efficiently or not spam ganking and running around to invade was by far the most efficient playstyle in Pro play and if that was the case in competitive where the ganks were the absolute hardest to pull off you'd probably assume that it's even better in solo queue where the ganks are easy and you are 100 correct in that assumption if you were a good jungler a few patches ago you were most assuredly doing something very similar to this in order to impact the map after all if you can't play for an individual lead then it's best just to play to get your teammates ahead and punish the laner not the other jungler a few mechanics compounded to make this more true than it ever has been the addition of treats for junglers allows you to gain gold value even while not farming and cash out on it later down the line this means you're punished Less on the gold end of the spectrum for potentially wasting time like if you're killed and you can't farm for a bit in addition to this kill comeback experience is absurd so that even if you were really far behind the second you participate in any kill you are instantly rewarded and catapulted ahead even just being one level down on a laner a super common occurrence for junglers would reward you with a huge percent increase in experience this made the reward for ganking go up by a huge margin and increase your risk tolerance Friends by a lot on top of this jungle camps reward you for being under leveled as well giving you 50 experience per level you are below the average a lot of players don't actually know if this is a lot or not so for comparison's sake this is about half the value of a camp for something like Raptors it's more than half meaning that if you're two or three levels down you're effectively getting two camps for the price of doing one in patch 11.10 when this was added Polaris did a great job of researching to figure out exactly how this worked the first cause specifying that you need to be two levels down on the average level of game might seem extreme at first but it's important to realize that the average level of the game never actually rounds down for example the average level of the game could be 9.1 and you would expect that to count as nine but it actually rounds up to 10. this means that getting the two level down requirement isn't all that rare at all you just have to be level 8 in a game where most people are level eight and nine and maybe some of the solo laners are Level 10 or at most 11. that's probably going to happen pretty much every game because of this the game is designed to keep you at the level of your Bot laners essentially and while it's really easy to get XP from behind it's super hard to get it from ahead not only do all of these bonuses drop off once you're even you also get reduced XP from Lane minions for the entire game which was supposed to be removed once your jungle item finished but once again Flores figured out that the patch notes were Incorrect and the game doesn't really work how they say it does when you combine all these factors together there really exists a ceiling for how far ahead junglers can get and the floor is pretty much right below it this made the risk for practically ganking non-stop almost zero and the reward was huge Not only would you get massive amounts of gold through shutdown bounties and treasure hunter you get to punish the people that you know would actually fall behind and stay behind laners if we need to visualize how to determine if we're in a farming or ganking meta what we're really doing is assessing the risk tolerance that we have with regards to ganking basically think of it as a scale like this if we're looking at a gank and can evaluate that it's pretty much just as likely to work as it is to fail we can throw it right in the middle of the scale but deciding if we go for it or not really depends on our risk tolerance or threshold for ganking in a meta-like 13.2 your risk tolerance would be really high meaning that you would only not go for the gank if it was super unlikely to work maybe just the bottom quarter wouldn't be attempted in a meadow where power farming is really strong your risk tolerance will be really low meaning that unless the gank is super likely to work you wouldn't even bother I.E if it's 75 or better you would probably try it it might be the exact same gank you were looking at but the threshold changes based in the meta and the systems in place in the past when a very extreme jungle meta existed you didn't really have to think super hard 13.2 you could just Spam gank and you were going to be right 75 of time or more two years ago you could power farm and you'd be right about 75 of the time as well unfortunately for us this system is constantly changing and every time there's a patch that affects experience or gold game for junglers your threshold is going to need to adapt because Riot really doesn't seem to want either extreme to flourish they attempted to push the needle into the middle with a few big adjustments on patch 13.4 namely that catch up kill XP and kill experience is being reduced especially in the cases that would help junglers most often which is one and two level differentials and kills early on from levels 3 to 10. from patch 13.3 we also received a few adjustments to disincentivize ganking like the reduction of treat gold the increase in Camp experience the reduction of warding totem cooldown and an increase in early Tower damage to help stop Dives and in patch 13.5 we received additional adjustments that are going to swing the needle again on top of a decrease in warding Totem cooldown we're now getting an early increase to the cooldown of sweeping lens which basically translates to more Wards and less ability to clear them more simply put this is a Nerf to gank success rate additionally something that was added in pre-season a hidden damage Nerf against enemy camps is being removed entirely and we're getting a Nerf to the amount of Lane experience chance that you can soak as a jungler the intention behind this is to increase the punishment for showing on map I.E ganking if you gank bottom and someone goes to your top side Riot wants that to actually matter not only can they take your camps faster they're also going to be rewarded more all of the camps are getting an increase in gold 10 per Camp average so we are getting a bit of an increase to overall gold generation jungle at the sacrifice of a lot of sources of experience you can't just get all of your XP from ganking and pushing the wave after not only are your Yanks less likely to even work in the first place due to trinket changes and Tower damage changes but now you're getting 35 percent less experience at the early levels which is huge to say the least catch up XP from camps does still exist but overall this is going to try and make both play Styles be viable it does mean that we just have to be much more conscious about picking the right option now gank or farm and not just defaulting to one or the other if we're right and the threshold for ganking lands in the middle now more than ever we have to be able to analyze the risk tolerance and actual risk of a gank so that we don't just end up wasting all of our time with each new Jungle patch we will of course update everyone where we think the needle will land but if you want to take advantage of the chaos and outperform your peers right away then being able to estimate where your risk tolerance should be with each patch the day of is crucial this skill is essentially your ability to read the changes in The Meta you should try to have a mental image of where the line where you do and don't go for ganks exist exist and aside from that the other most important tool for adapting to any new meta is to be able to accurately predict if a gank is going to work or not and these metas where the needle is in the middle this is the most important skill you can develop and there are a few General ideas you can use in order to improve at this one of the best skills to master is reading your opponent's body language I made multiple full-length guides on this over at our website and if you want a more in-depth guide on how to do this I definitely recommend watching those it basically just lets you read your opponent's minds and tells you exactly what they're going to do next aside from this there are three other main ideas that you use when calculating the risk of any gank one the wave state two the resources available and three the gank angle wave state basically means where the wave is currently and where it's going to end up a wave that is pushing back into you is going to be much easier to gank on than a wave that is pushing away for example except in the case of a dive where you actually do want the wave to crash if you can't read a wave and predict what it will do it's going to be very hard to actually gauge a game success rate this is another complicated topic that we have also made full guides on so we're not going to go super deep into it here however this does segue well into the next point resources includes a lot of things one of the biggest being Health a way of pushing into the opponent's Tower at full health is much different than when they're at 10 and will be killed by a light breed someone being low HP makes ganks much more likely to work and as much as this matters so does their Summoner spells and regular abilities as well ganking someone who you know has no flash ultimate or Escape ability all impacts this very heavily and should definitely weigh into your decision making for both these points this is why High ELO players and coaches will always harp on players for not moving their camera to lanes and just using their minimap it's simply not enough to only see icons on a map when you need so much more information to actually decide what to do next if you're having problems this is the first thing that I would look at good camera control will also help you spot when your enemies move to place Wards if you know exactly where award is you can go around it and not being spotted is one of the easiest ways to improve your odds you have sweeper up and can verify you haven't been seen do you have a pink in the bush on the way do you have a blast cone that makes a really creative gank angle possible can you get behind your opponent to cut off or Escape or are you running at them head-on do you know where the enemy team is well you get counter ganked this is a huge list of questions but they're all good questions to ask ultimately understanding if you can make a gank happen is both parts experience and learned knowledge you need to have a feel for your Champions damage move speed how tanky your opponents are their abilities and these are all variables that are going to heavily change every single game there is no 100 guaranteed way to say if a gank will work or not but the more thorough you are with your thought process and reasoning before committing to anything the better your decision making is going to be we don't even really know where the ideal risk tolerance is going to be on this patch yet but understanding how that has impact our decisions as well as how to accurately evaluate risks of a gang let us have confidence that we can succeed regardless of how op jungle is or isn't on any given patch because this is the role that can impact Lanes the most while simultaneously being a carry role in itself you will always have insanely high impact in the game regardless of the meta if you find yourself being unable to carry like you did on a different patch it's quite possible that you just haven't adapted your risk tolerance to match what the game calls for and if you found this guide useful then you'll absolutely love our hyper Improvement

knowledge and overall strength let's not waste any more time and dive into these three Champions and their powerful builds aatrox mid has slowly been making his way in an a due to his powerful Flex potential and laning phase while it may seem counter-intuitive aatrox is actually able to thrive versus Mages in the mid lane with a jungler by his side they can win nearly any Skirmish and secure objectives for their team next up we've got Zack's support Zach was already making his way into the support role but with Riot introducing new items as well as buffing him he's now stronger than ever Zack offers High base damage great CC and is honestly one of the most fun Champions to play finally we've got singed mid while this may not be entirely off meta at this point singed mid fell off really hard it used to be a popular pick as it offered waveclear fighting Power and above all amazing roaming the preseason has brought him back better than ever so do not underestimate him ","79":"hey what's up game weepers this is the come and in today's 13.5 patch a preview yes that's right we're giving you a preview so I'll be going through the Champions the items and everything else getting like buffed and nerfed and changing 13.5 and tomorrow when the ride there's actually release what the actual changes will be we will do a video on those as well so make sure you hit that subscribe button so you don't miss tomorrow's video and also make sure if you want to master any of the champions in this game if you want to master a role if you want to perfect your micro and macro we have so many videos uploaded to our website that are exclusive for our subscribers that help them Reach their Peak Performance on the rift so make sure you guys join the club by signing up the links are in the description and comment section and yeah let's get into the preview for 13.5 so we will start with champion Buffs so LeBlanc I mentioned this in our previous 13.5 video because some of these changes did get leaked and for LeBlanc the fact you're going to get are Mana refund and cooldown refund in your queue when you last Say minions this is awesome this helps with your wave clear and yeah just your laning phase I guess and see us sing as well right this will also work for your ultimate Q2 and I'm sure LeBlanc bands out there are rejoicing let me know guys in the comment section if you are because these do look really really nice on paper now another champion getting buffed is Canon little Kelly and Kennen was meant to get Buffs a couple of patches ago before I pushed it back but in 13.5 Canon is listed here as getting above what the bus will be I've got no idea so it might be like I had a pointless doing this video but again I just want to tell you guys who's getting buffed so you can get excited for them and before the balance team only give you like the smallest buff in the world but yeah kind of getting buffed is really struggling at the moment so this does seem legit even if you're picking him as like a counterpect of Fiora and Jax you don't actually counter those Champions because they're so busted but this seems legit now another champion getting buffed honestly this feels like the Riven buff in a way where I don't even know if this Champion needs a buff at the moment this being a shocks like yes he's not S2 I understand that he's not as strong as he used to be but he's not terrible like he's still playable but Ryder's deciding to buff him because I guess he's like one of the most popular top players in here they gotta make that back so HR ceiling buffed uh it's one of those ones now Tryndamere is also getting buffed this one I actually kind of agree yesterday benefited from novory quick play getting buffed but in the Top Lane at the moment and whether you're playing him in the mid lane doesn't really matter he's kind of just like underperforming kind of like Canon compared to the other strong top planers he really just like pales in comparison the Trinity getting buffed I'm all for this just as long as it's not super op now another champion getting buffed in the Top Lane is Rumble and I'm kind of excited about this because Rumble well in Pro player makes games super exciting because he's a very snowbally you know kind of like coin flip Champion I guess and because he's such a strong early game Champion he does very well in team fights as well because of his ultimate of course so I'm super excited to see what this is just probably don't pick him guys in 13.5 if you have a bunch of AP on your team because you probably will be useless going into like 5x drinkers now moving to the mid lane Fizz is the only Champion here well along with LeBlanc I guess getting buffed again what the bus are going to be I have no idea hopefully it's something to do maybe with like the Mana cost in your e because at the moment for Fez you're still having to go luden's Tempest right whereas you would much rather just go like rocket belt or night Harvester and not have to go in Mana Mythic those are for actual like control Mages you're in a lesson all you want to do is just like one round of combos but you go home so quickly so hopefully this is what the change will be again I'm not sure whether it will be we'll have to wait and see this means let me know in the comments what you actually want to see out now moving down to the bot Lane we've got two Champions getting buffed the first of these is jinx now honestly I think Jinx is like kind of underrated right now I think she's actually in like a flying position and for her to get buffed I'm kind of worried about it especially in kind of like the pro sense I guess because Jinx is very good in Pro play as well she gets very good priority she has amazing scaling ride her laning phase is nowhere near as bad as what it used to be and in most matchups you're going to be able to scale out of them there aren't that many like two dominant early game Eddie carries at the moment so Jinx getting buffed yes it does look a little bit frightening but Jinx means you should be super happy of course now the other AD carry getting buffed is Samira a ride have classified here that this will be a partial walk back now I'm guessing this is going to be some sort of buff to your passive which they did Nerf in 13.4 I mean it could even still be that they'll give you a little bit of light still back in your ultimate because Samira has really dropped like a stone in this patch right because of the nurse she's gone from like being S Plus there all the way down to like a b tier 80 carry a win rate has dropped like three percent as well so this partial walk back we will find out tomorrow exactly what it is but still I think this bar for these Buffs are going to be justified now Champion nuts we talked about two of these in our 13.5 video so Gangplank is getting nerfed your ease cooldown is now going to be on a flat 18 seconds the recharge timer that is and also your passage damage is getting nerfed in the early game just a tiny bit but more so in the mid to late game this is really important for GP especially the passive Nerf because your passive is well it kind of separates like the best GP players from everyone else right being able to like procure Kegs and use your passive multiple times that's really the key to maximizing DPS on this champion and that damage per second is going to be less than x patch also the battle timer going up yes it actually does mean something even though you're getting novori and all the haze from this it still does mean something especially in the early laning phase before you have all that ability has so GP is getting nerfed which AP is also getting nerves to the actual stacking the AP ratio in your contaminate this going down I just think this is really healthy I don't even know why like twitch AP is a thing this Champion is meant to be an attack damage Champion but yeah twitch AP I mean I guess it opens up Variety in the boat Lane but I just think it's like one of the most obnoxious things in the game going AP twitch whether it's support ad carry with like crown and Nash's oh get me out now funnily enough right I've actually put his Sarah some brights now I'm not sure like if they've deliberately put this on Champion Earth so like every Champion going Saras like a Nivea rise Cassiopeia is getting nerved here not sure what this is about if it is like an actual item or if they're referring to a champion with this but yeah Sarah's Embrace is getting nerfed in 13.5 so will this mean that those Champions I mentioned like anivia Cassiopeia arise are gonna get hit big time by this we'll have to wait and see of course but this will also affect Champions who aren't that great in the mid lane still building this so maybe a champion like orianna maybe something like Victor even syndra can build this these Champions might be worse off if the Nerf is too big now staying in the mid lane just for a second here we also have aurelian soul getting Nerf this Champion I've mentioned in our recent videos is performing at such a high level across every single ELO he's honestly probably like the number one mid laner yes he's not as strong as he used to be I understand that but statistically speaking he's in a very good position so he's on the Nerf list for 13.5 now heading into the jungle we have Ramy getting nerves in other words ramus the armadillo and the reason for this is because well he's just like outperforming pretty much every single jungler in the majority of elos now in high reload he's not doing too well but yes across most dealers which is where most people play this chairman has ridiculous stats like 53 plus percent win rate so that probably does justify Ramos getting nerfed in 13.5 now heading back down to the bot Lane here we've got 280 carries getting nerfed and honestly I even called for one of these getting Nerfs I mean it's not like the biggest prediction of all time but Zara is getting nerfed in 13.5 the bus to navory so because it's your second item now in the actual path of his procking or 40 crit and the bust your attack speed a couple of patches ago they have meant this Championship super op and that's in every single ELO as well this isn't just like specific to High ELO or like low ELO every single ELO lock-ins are you've got a great chance of winning the upper 80 carry getting Nerf and we've seen this Champion picked and banned for so long now in Pro play even in just normal you know solo qc's victim bad this being Caitlyn this Champion is just the ultimate Lane bully still even if you pick something like Varys into her or something that might do well into her like an ash these Champions just aren't strong enough to compete with akaline so thankfully she's on the no selfless as well I think most of these Nerfs and even the bus they actually seem pretty good and healthy for the game thus far now the last champion guys getting nerfed in 13.5 is Yorick so I'm kind of surprised by this because York really kind of like struggles in high reloos and those one tricks really aren't going to appreciate whatever's gonna happen to them in 13.5 but yes in the majority of elos if you're going something like sunderer if you're abusing the New Black Cleaver which is giving you HPM or attack damage whatever build you're going on Yorick the champion is doing very well and just digging upgrades for his opponents so yeah maybe this is validated through the actual stats we're seeing in the majority of elos now moving to Champion adjustments first of all we have a Yumi now I don't want to talk too much about Yumi but let me just tell you guys she's going to be super busted like I just guarantee it the fact you can now move your Ultima to where your cursor is going so it's not just going to be in like a straight line you can actually direct it based on your cursor also the rest of your abilities I mean Ryan have pretty much said here and we mentioned these in our 13.5 previous video that her abilities are now going to be better for her best friend so whoever you're attached to right but in particular the ad carry on x2 and if you guys have actually seen any of the footage of the new Yumi I'll just get me out like this is gonna to be picked and bad honestly I just want them to like delete the champion or just make it targetable that would be so nice for the game like you can actually hit a Yumi rather than hitting the Championships attached to like you guys know the drift by now but yeah Yumi is one Champion getting adjusted moving on we have Pantheon now Pantheon is actually getting some big changes I've kind of like seen what these might be so your Q cooldown is going to go down the Mana cross is also going to go down your attack speed ratio is going up as well and your base attack speed so these are really nice for Pantheon they make your laning phase a little bit better but your health growth is going to go down by like 1.5 so you will be a little bit squishier in the mid to late game but the trade-off is your early game is going to be better your Q perks your Q spam is going to be more effective as well now moving on we have Zed so the E cooldown revert well yeah that's all it is your Eve the cooldown is getting reverted so I'm guessing Ryder talking about the 1223 Nerf where they increase your ears cooldown from Rank 2 onwards well this is actually going back to what it was before this patch I'm pretty sure anyway I'm assuming this is what they're talking about so I don't even know why this is like a champion adjustment this is just a straight up buff for Z so yeah he's getting buffed in 13.5 good luck to all you mid laners out there now the last two Champions guys getting adjusted here first of all we have Ash now pretty much these adjustments and we've already talked about these in our 13.5 video they are trying to push Ash towards more of like an ad carry Ash so the actual making your cure cooldown now so a 10 second quarter but what they're doing is actually making this scale off attack speed right so if you're building a taxi like any other 80 carry it will benefit more from this than you will right now now obviously this doesn't benefit support Ash in any single way so you're missing out on this and full support Ash because she's one of the most like obnoxious and oppressive Champions right now she's picked and banned in Pro play solo queue super annoying to play against your W's cooldown is increasing at later rank so it's going from four second to rank 5 to 6 seconds and also your ultimate cooldown is increasing in the other game so they're trying to push Ash out of the support role which seems good and into the ad carry roll now the final Champion getting adjusted is kind of like Ashton away this being azir there was win rate may have improved a little bit like across all lilo's but he's still like a pretty underwhelming champion in solo queue so what they're going to be doing is decreasing your Mana even more in the early game but they are going to be increasing like your attack speed so your base attack speed stats so that means hopefully you won't have to go Nash's too if you can actually build legit items I mean they should just make it so like Nash's is on hit procs on your soldiers but they're not doing that but yeah the actual changes to azir again guys we detailed in our 13.5 videos so if you want to know the changes go and watch that it's also like half the video there's so many of them but yeah Mains again let me know in the comment section and anyone else if you play these Champions will mentioned let me know what you think the changes are actually going to be now the system bus we only have one item getting buffed here that's been calls me drive now obviously if you're playing AP Champions so you know people who are interested in ability Haze so we might be talking stuff like Vladimir maybe like Silas you know these champers where yeah ability Ace and having a lot of cooldowns it's just the essence of your Champion maybe stuff like you know gragas will be interested in this as well Shaco AP Shaco in the jungle maybe some supports as well maybe might open you up you know in the mid to late game after your first two major items but yeah Cosmic drivers getting buffed in 13.5 now system adjustments there are no system nurse here but honestly adjustments could mean anything from the balance team so first of all we have Triumph because they've buffed over here like two patches in a row but still no one is actually like go in that room so by nerving Triumph they're trying to encourage you to go over here but honestly I don't think this will change too much and again we went through those changes the Triumph changes in our 13.5 video and we also did the same thing for grass the undying these changes have been released I don't know how much that's going to change honestly like the graphs kind of changes you're getting more HP from the roon and a base heal and honestly as far as like the Champions going grass right now especially Champions like Fiora Jax goes in some laptops Camille ride these Bruiser spiders GP I still think they're going to be able to abuse this but obviously we'll have to wait and see for 13.5 and finally guys there are jungle adjustments so Ryder trying again once again because they've done this for a couple of patches now they're trying to encourage you to clear your cams because it's still well just not really like Worth to counter jungle or to clear your own camps when you're playing these really good gankers like j4 release still maokai is still very good actually you don't actually have to farm your camps all that much to be effective the much more snowbally and just yeah highest win rate player style in the jungle is to just hit your level 3 Spike and Perma gank Lanes we'll have to say again if it actually changes the jungle play style in 13.5 but guys those were the listed changes for next patch let me know in the comment section any thoughts you might have please remember to leave a like Down Below on the video if you have watched up until this point thank you so much and until tomorrow's season 13 upload where we detail what these changes are gonna be this has been become foreign ","80":"patch 13.5 was another massive one with many meta shifting changes being issued is Yumi back in a viable spot due to her mini rework is jinx now the best ADC after her recent Buffs we've got all this to answer and so much more as we bring you guys the updated tier list for 13.5 thanks to the help of our Challenger players and analyzing the most recent data but before we get into it be sure to check out skill cap if you want to truly get better at League of Legends we're the only service that offers a money-back guarantee if you don't climb at least five divisions while actively using our service we do this because our service really does work and if it doesn't work for you you shouldn't pay learn more at the end of this video or click the link in the description below one Top Lane Champion has become a whole lot stronger this patch but is still being slept on is Pantheon Lane bully power is pretty ridiculous now with Q cooldown being reduced by two seconds at rank one on top of this Pantheon plays very well into many of the highly contested solo queue top laners like Jax Jace aatrox and Riven winning over 53 in all those matchups the only meta matchup that is a hindrance Pantheon is malphite so it's easy enough to just ban him out if you're looking to pick up some Pantheon top the standard build is a clips into Black Cleaver second and Spear of shojin third conqueror is the best Keystone Rune along with resolve for secondaries running conditioning and overgrowth in regards to Pantheon's tearless placement he will be locking down a very powerful s-tier position for 13.5 another top laner on the rise in recent patches and who's suddenly the best solo Q tank is cho'gath those 13.4 cho'gath Buffs turned out extremely impactful and he's absolutely dominating many meta Top Lane matchups many A.D Bruiser top laners are getting smacked around by malphite this patch but Cho is one of the few Champs who stops on him super hard with Joe being able to farm from range with q and scaling really well due to his ultimate Stacks The champ is one of the better blind pickable tops right now even if you lose Lane you have many different ways to be impactful throughout the game whether it be from Landing CC in fights or securing objectives with ultimate for Cho's tearless placement he will be moving up one tier going from a into s for 30 18.5 for the op tier up in Top Lane we have malphite Darius and Olaf looking down on everyone else Gangplank changes this patch have been a little more detrimental than GP Mains would have liked seeing him lose almost three percent of his overall win rate GP had been a pretty op pick for multiple patches so a metashakeup isn't a terrible thing but we'll have to adjust him even further down the tier list into a tier for 13.5 you know Buffs are pretty negligible when the champ actually becomes analytically worse after receiving them that's been the unfortunate fate for aatrox in 13.5 as his Buffs have not moved the needle in the slightest to Warrant a move up the tier list top three low ELO top laners of the patch are Yorick Garen and nasus we have Fiora Darius and malphite as the highest priority Top Lane bands jungle was changed this patch so that the gold you receive from killing camps is increased this has led to a very positive outlook for one jungler in specific being Kane Kane can absolutely Maul through a full clear especially when he gets some items so he has seen a nice uptick in power for 13.5 Kane was also directly buffed a few patches ago so all the changes combined have pushed him back into a really powerful spot for solo queue s tier is where Kane will be placed on the tier list besides Kane another really strong jungle option this patch who has slowly but surely made his way back into meta is hecarim just like Kane hecarim can blast through a clear due to his excellent AOE damage so the gold increase on Jungle camps has been great another big reason for hecarim's Resurgence is due to his very powerful versatile build of Black Cleaver manamune and radiant virtue we covered this setup in a recent op builds video and is a huge reason to why heck is seeing a lot more success heck is another jungler who will be moving up the tier list and back into a strong s tier spot for 13.5 the op tier for Jungle stays consistent from recent patches with fiddle Evelyn and Jarvan being the most optimal carries although farming has been incentivized a little more over ganking 13.5 it has not shifted the win rate in the slightest of a strong ganker like Jarvan junglers who have the ability to clear their camps extremely fast have seen a small spike in win rate for 13.5 we already mentioned Kane and hecarim but a few more worth noting include karthus and Lilia ramus was the one jungler directly nerfed this patch and he has lined up analytically with how much we expected his power to drop still a decent eight-tier jungler but not the S tier pick of recent patches the best slow ELO junglers of the patch are fiddle mordekaiser and Jarvan Evelyn Kane and Jarvan are three of the highest value bands well it's safe to say that the aurelian soul Nerfs did very little in reducing his power level it makes sense as to why Riot would go lighter on the first set of Nerfs because they don't want their newly reworked Champion immediately pushed out of meta gotta sell those skins somehow one thing worth noting in regards to aurelian's build this batch is that leandries is quite underrated in the correct spots many players are just autopilot building Rod of Ages each game but when you're going against an enemy comp that has three or more Champs at stack Health prioritize leandries instead as for aurelian's tearless placement we did originally expect the Nerf to hit a little harder but Seoul continues to perform extremely well in 13.5 and we'll be giving him the bump back into op tier yikes those his ear changes are not playing out very well this far with his overall win rate plummeting three percent Riot tried to weaken his ears laning power while compensating his late game scaling but those early game Nerfs have outweighed the Buffs by a long shot base stat changes are often overlooked and hard to predict how impactful they'll turn out but with his ear losing 70 base Health along with 60 Mana he's so much more exploitable early on sure the late game Power may be stronger but does that really matter if you can't even escape the laning phase to reach that point Riot likely follows up on his ear heading into 13.6 so we would recommend to stay away from the pick and solo queue until further Buffs come through for the mid lane tier list op Champs consist of Annie aurelian soul and Cassiopeia we expected a little more out of seraph's nurse but they really haven't moved the needle in regards to decreasing the power level of Chancellor Cassio anivia and aurelian all three remain top tier carries for 13.5 to follow up on the LeBlanc Q Buffs they were more of a quality of life change than a buff as the changes have not significantly shifted her power for solo queue as a result LeBlanc will continue to be ranked in our mid Lane beats here if you've been trying to climb from low ELO and mid lane now is one of the best times to do so with Annie being in such a great spot if all you have are Annie and vegar in your champion pool right now for any ELO bracket really you're set up extremely well for 13.5 as for the best mid lane bands Annie vegar and aurelian soul top the list why does it always seem like whenever Riot tries to buff agar he ends up being a better bot Lane carry than a mid laner that's what's played out once again as vegar is absolutely smashing the bottling competition in 13.5 bot Lane vague has always been a safer pick than mid lane because you don't have to deal with high Mobility assassins that can Zone you off farm with Q range being increased it now becomes even easier for vegar to secure CS bot Lane and he gets to scale for free kill power at level 6 is nothing to scoff at either and now that we are seeing more hook supports played due to recent thresh and Nautilus Buffs The Meta synergies for vegar are great the most popular build is actually kind of disgusting as you build Rod into archangel's second in Dead Man's plate third in a way this build defies the laws of league as you're able to deal boatload of damage while being a semi-tank at the same time optimal Rune page to run his first strike of sorcery for secondaries being mana flow and Transcendence optier is where you'll find vegar on the bot Lane tier list for 13.5 we predicted that Jinx would become an OP carry off the back of a 13.5 Buffs and that's exactly what's played out thus far massive win rate and play rate Spike this patch which in combination are good confirmations that Jinx is indeed an OP ADC crack it into Infinity Edge combo is the standard two item core for Jinx right now third item really depends on the game as fire Cannon phantom dancer and hurricane are all viable lethal Tempo is far beyond the best Keystone for Jinx combined with sorcery for secondaries running absolute focus and Gathering storm so we've got two newcomers in the op tier this patch with vegar and Jinx joining alongside Zaya the Zion nerves have reduced their power level a decent amount but not quite to the extent where she is stripped from her op to your spot on the other hand Kate Nerfs have been quite detrimental and have pushed her down to being one of the weaker adcs those base stat Nerfs never seem like a massive deal on paper but in this case I've shaved off about two percent to Caitlyn's win rate although Ash changes were targeted at nerfing support Ash while keeping ADC Ash in check they've negatively impacted Ash ADC as well so of all the ADC changes this patch ziya and twitch are still great while Kate and Ash are too worth staying away from now our top three low ELO picks for ADC are Tristana Miss Fortune and vegar Jinx Draven and Zaya are who we have highest on the ban list it was fun while it lasted with Yumi being picked in only two percent of games last patch but as a result of the mini rework she's now the second most played support it pains us to report that she's actually not in a terrible spot either scale expression is definitely down compared to the previous version of Yumi which is weird to even say considering she was pretty simple before with a new passive you more often than not just want to sit on your ADC instead of swapping around based on unique circumstances best synergies right now are with the stronger scaling team fight adcs like Zary twitch and sivir yumi's Performing absolutely trash with picks like Draven Samira and Caitlyn which makes sense as her early laning power is definitely weaker than for in regards to umi's tearless placement she will be making the jump from the depths of C tier all the way into a tier for 13.5 Ash ADC was hit pretty hard by the Nerfs but Ash support has been absolutely decimated W and R Nerfs directly Target Ash support while the Q Buffs don't really do anything to compensate melee supports are looking extra juicy now as this is yet another ranged support that falls off the ship Ash will be swapping positions with Yumi this patch going from a tier all the way down to C the bulk of the support meta does not change all that much for 13.5 as Santa thresh Annie and rakan remained the most powerful carries with you me being played a ton once again look to Punisher by picking a strong melee engage support like Recon Nautilus or thresh all three Champs are finding amazing success into Yumi winning over 54 of the time in the matchup brand Heimer and Zyra are who we recommend the most to climb low ELO the fastest rakan thresh and Annie are all amazing ban options due to their High play rates and overall power levels alright guys before we wrap this up let's tell you a little more about skill caps so we offer a five division rank of game T and think that's a pretty crazy thing to offer it's like a gym membership guaranteeing you'll get ripped your local gym would go bust if they offered that right not us we've offered this for years because our service really does work it works so well in fact that we're able to produce by far the largest catalog of Premium League guides on the internet we add over 20 videos a week with over 1600 guides curated into over 100 courses no one can compare we've also sent Challenger players into ELO hell's 714 times and Counting where they commentate how to carry live they also respond to all questions asked sign up today for as little as 6.99 a month if you are serious about improving so there you have it guys a complete update on the solo queue tier list as we reach the Midway Mark of 13.5 thank you all for watching good luck in solo queue and we'll catch you back soon ","81":"hey what's going on game Loopers this is easy in today's video 15 most broken champions for 12 23 I mean you probably read the title I don't know why I say that stuff but yeah before we get into the countdown guys like always these countdowns like I can tell you like who the best Champions are gonna be of course but at the end of the day the difference between like maybe a low ELO player and High ELO player is for the most part going to be how you're playing the game not the actual champion you're playing so to actually perfect the role you're playing these champions in which is by far the most important like kind of thing I guess to climbing check out the game leap website link Down Below in the description comment section our challenging players and coaches from around the world upload daily videos for our subscribers so get exclusive access to that library of content by signing up and yeah let's get into the countdown now it's not really like a countdown so what I'm going to do I'm just going to go through the roles and the Champions who are super broken in these roles so first of all let's start on the top Lane now the first Champion who's been broken ever since Riot changed the game in 1210 with the durability tanky meta this is Darius nothing is changing next patch room to be honest because ravenous Hydra is getting nerfed lots of Champions and we might get into a couple and then near future well because of the hydro Nerf they're getting indirectly nerfed right which is great for Darris because you're not going Hydra whether you're going Trinity Force when you're really fed and the enemy team is very squishy and melee if you're going shrybreaker because the enemy team has a bit of kite so you need the stickiness to stick to them honestly this chair pin is just super broken still innately speaking so it doesn't even really matter if those are random are getting Nerf the champion is just so so strong still so if you're not playing darus in the Top Lane if he's not in your champion pool then it is really time to do so now speaking of one of those ravenous Hydra abusers who is going to feel a little bit of the Nerf next patch because there's going to be no Omni verb and also the damage from the cleave passive this is getting reduced by five percent for melee Champions and range Champions as well so for Fiora you might build this a little bit but the great thing for Fiora is is that she so innately strong just like darus I mean all these Champions are innately strong don't get me wrong but speaking of Fiora whether you're going grassly undying for those kind of like trading matchups in the Top Lane which makes you pretty much unbeatable in terms of trading because the heel at the end of it the fact you can proc this off your lunge as well it's just too busted or whether you're going conqueror because stacking this one once you do get to full stacks of conqueror with the ravenous Hydra and divine Sandra setup for example it's incredibly powerful and I'm sure if we've played Top Lane Fiora is just one of those Champions you hate seeing locked in on the enemy team so she is the second Top Lane another third tall planer this is a champion who well I mean you could probably get away with building Hydra on it but for Jax what you really want to be doing is going Sandra and then maybe even Spirit Shogun is your second major item of course you don't have to though you can go Frozen hard to understand something like this but Jax just like Darris and Fiora and lately strong right because this Champion will lethal Tempo the stacking with your passive it's so op and champions have to be very careful trading against you because of your amazing Gap closing potential ride with your leave strike obviously just make sure you're messing your W first this combined with the sheen proc from your Divine sunderer you will deal so much damage and because there are lots of Tanki champions in the game Jax being a Divine sunderer user the spellblade passive is so useful to shred through that HP so Jax is the third champion in this video another fourth champion this is actually one of those tanks and would do pretty well into Jax this being Shen so if you see an auto attack based champion in the top line Shin is unreal because of his W of course but another reason why Shen is going to be even better in 1223 is that Sunfire ages is getting buffed so not only are you getting more HP in the item but it's going to be cheaper as well this is awesome news because if you're going hard still into Sunfire Aegis well this build is just better right it's cheaper you'll get to your second major items by quicker so for shed it's great also for  at the moment his win rates I mean he's classified as an S plus two champion in pretty much every single Lilo is easy to play very good for junglers because your setup is so good because if you're taunt and of course your ultimate your standard United it can protect teammates and with hard steel it's even more broken because the HP you get from this item and hard still just speaking of this because the shin you're going to be in close combat with enemy Champions and it should be easy to proc to be honest you're actually a pretty oppressive offensive attacking Champion with this build even though you have a lot of tankiness you deal very good damage as well so Shen is the fourth top laner but not the last one this is Camille So a bit like Fiora ravenous Hydra is going to affect you Camille players out there but one of the best things about Camille is that you shred Champions with HP which is really what is kind of like defining the matter at the moment if you have good DPS if you can shred through HP you're going to be loving life Camille just happens to be another one of these Champions just like I mentioned the ravenous Hydro Nerf I mean this patch should be bad for Camille but the Nerf really isn't big enough the carnivorous stacking is staying the same it's really just the damage you're losing a little bit from the cleave passive and of course the omnivan but you're still getting 10 so you should be sweet so Darris for your rejection Camille those are the five top players in this video now moving down to the mid lane we only have two mid laners here the first one is well actually Champion getting nerfed in 1223 so how on Earth can she still be broken well this is syndra now I understand that there are three Nerfs here right we might be like oh my goodness three nurse a Champions just become so bad because of them well let's think about belvith she got like four Nerfs in one patch still broken let's think about Janna she got like four nurse in one patch still has like a 53 54 win rate gonna be the same for syndra to be honest it might drop maybe one percent you know if you're lucky but honestly Guys these Nursery to your W's damage to your ease damage to the AP ratio and then your ease cooled up it's really not going to change that much because your W is not like the most important ability in your kit they're not nerfing your Q which is one of the big keys to send your strength also your e the actual cone radius right so the radius the area of effect from your scatter of the week that's the big positive for this ability so yes they can know for damage but it's still going to be impossible to miss especially when you get to those Splinter stacks and it's at 90 degrees also the cooldown going up by two seconds you're probably only going to use this once per minion wave in the mid lane during the laning phase and when you do get to team fights again you're probably only going to use a couple of these two seconds is not going to change all that much so syndra is the best AP mid laner for 1223 as well as now but the best AED mid laner and maybe even the best champion on the rift at the moment who will still be very good in 1223 this is Zed now I understand the Zed if you're rushing ravenous Hydra it's really the big thing at the moment right it's the big Trend but even with the Hydra Nerf it's not really going to change that much so Z means you should still be happy I thought Zed was going to get nerfed himself so to kind of Escape 1223 with an indirect Nerf this is just a bit of a bonus to be honest just make sure guys if you are playing Zed that you are maxing your W second that's right not your Shadow slash even though right above this but think about it they buff the actual energy so it's 40 flat you don't have to worry about maxing it to get it lower it's going to be 40 even with one point in this getting your W maxed out second the cooldown goes down this is the big thing here and for those of you who have played this setup with zed it is unreal it's one of the big reasons why he is classified just like I mentioned for Shen as an S Plus 2 champion in pretty much every single ELO so if you need some attack damage Z in the mid lane one of the strongest picks now moving down to the bot Lane here with a 380 carries to talk about now the first of it is the champion who is getting untouched in 1223 which is great news this is Caitlyn who is the strongest AD carry mainly because she's uncontestable during the laning phase there are very few in fact there are no Champions who can deal with her strength at the moment because of the Buffs to Caitlyn not so long ago where they increase your headshot damage via the passive so your trap damage might be down but remember most short headshots will come from your passive especially especially if you're Auto attacking from brushes right because these Autos count as two stacks so you get to those headshots quicker so you might be able to abuse this a little bit more but Caitlyn with lethal Tempo the range it's too much for every ADC to deal with so if she's not bad you should definitely pick her in your Champ's legs at the moment and continuing into 1223 as well but maybe one champion who might be able to contest Caitlyn a little bit this is Lucian now first strike Lucian hopefully as well you have like an army next year who can Empower you especially your burst damage with First Strike you'll be getting so much gold and getting so much damage off but even if you don't have an army next to you and lately speaking Lucian is a very good 80 carry you have good poke with your Q you have good Mobility so you can pounce on your enemies mistakes with your e and also Escape those situations and the cooldown base build at the moment for Lucian where you're going cooldown boots Lucidity boots this really helps you trigger your passive even more later into a game right so that's really going to help your DPS so Lucian if you don't want to play Kalyn honestly probably the second best 80 carry now the third best ad carry this one is really just statistically speaking and I'd really be picking her as a counterpick because blind picking Kaiser very risky Caitlyn cross pushes you Lucian crushes you a champion like Zion does very well even if felios does very well into Kaiser so there are a bunch of Champions that can be picked against you and you can't ban all of them so if the enemy 80 carrier is playing something really free right like they're not the scariest champion in Lane maybe something like a jit maybe something like an Ezreal oh my goodness peacocks you can outscale everyone and get your evolutions and the enemy Nexus will probably explode shortly afterwards and really Kaiser's strength well that has come from all the bus recently to her so even though they've mostly been like kind of AP I guess this still helps your DPS and that's why she has to be considered here now moving into the jungle Guys these are actually the last four Champions so I know like I could mention supports here so maybe Janna maybe Nami like they have the best win rate maybe even Ronaldo just innately speaking Zyra is a very good support there are a bunch of them but in the jungle I just think these Champions are stronger so that's why there's no supports here it's not because I have some sort of like anti-support mindset because I've mentioned them in every other video it's just that yeah these four Champions well let's see if you can contest me here because I think these are more broken than any other support have first Champion is Wukong now I understand rabbit is Hydra getting no effects Wukong a little bit but this champion because you still have Divine Sandra and you can get through all the HP in the game busted that's the reason why and with conqueror the stacking too too good so Wukong is the first jungler now the last three are AP now two of these are really big Heavy Hitters the first is Echo so ever since Ryan had buffed Echo recently right he's really taken off in terms of the Jungle and because of the changes to the Jungle so in terms of krugs spawning all the little krugs now because you're an area of effect clearer you can clear so easily well I guess with your Q at least you clear these camps so quickly now right so it's Echo because lots of Champions or players I guess are full clearing because you want a full clearing just scale and you will outscale pretty much everyone you can afford to do so now you're not going to get punished as much so I guess like the new Jungle mentality jungle meta if you will has really helped out Echo and because it's easier to clear krugs and just get through your camps he has to be in consideration and that reasoning is exactly the same for this next Champion Evelyn who has received some nice blasts recently and because of the changes to the Jungle to the Jungle cam absent almost like the jungler's mentality I guess oh let's just clear camps and you know shake hands which I actually think is wrong for the most part but anyway that's how most people are playing the game right so Echo Evelyn full clearers they can get to level four free of charge and play the game and once you get to level six once you have saw shoes in Your Rocker bow for Evelyn or Echo you are in such a strong position to then take over a game and Evelyn and platinum and above to have over a 53 53 and a half percent win rate goes to show how good she is now the final Champion guys on this countdown is actually a champion getting buffed in 1223 because I think the Buffs and even nurse in 1223 will some of them are sizable but not sizable enough but this one I think is these are to Zach so your Q's cooldown is going down the damage is going up as well and you'll also be healing more from your passive right so when you drop those blobs picking them up you'll restore more of your HP now which is actually scaling off your max HP and because of the Sunfire Aegis buff as well this is really nice for Zach I think it's going to put him back on the map and actually be op again and if there are any Zach Mains out there let me know in the comment section if you think he will be broken just because these Buffs that are are coming in so I know there's a lot of them but I think they are actually quite significant and if there are any other thoughts guys you might have on this countdown on Champions who are getting changed all the ones we mentioned of course let us know down below and if you do want these preseason videos to continue leave a like down below and until our next one this has been [Music] ","82":null,"83":"13.1 B has changed well honestly guys not that much because the 10 most broken Champions updated in this video that we're about to get into yeah you've heard them all before there may have been some nurse and some Buffs directly to Champions they may have been some really big like system changes as far as the Grievous wins changes go but honestly the rift really hasn't changed all that much but there are a couple of new champions in this top 10 and this data that I've pulled this is in master and above in Korea so this is really representative of the actual meta and what is really op and what you're probably going to see in pro games but just before we do get into the video one thing you guys have to do before you get into your next game is to download the poor Professor app Linked In the description because it allows you to quickly import the best room page you use from the best players in the world on the champion you're picking you don't have to make the room page just one click of a bun and bang you're ready to go but that's not all because the app also allows you to scale your opponent and the app will give you their stats how well they play their Champion so you can know more about your opponent than they know about themselves and the app also gives you an in-game overlay so you can compare your CS in your kill participation to your rank or even Challenger players like Faker and there's a reason why 3 million people have downloaded this free application guys it's because it works so get around it in season 12 those links are in the description coming in at number 10 is the only ad carry on this list now there's been a lot of talk about Draven right rushing bloodthirster into Infinity Edge there's been a lot of talk about maybe Samira doing the same right and all of the changes that came into the ad carry scene but the best they did carry well it must run above in Korea is Caitlyn with close to a 54 win rate and that's in close to 900 matches and for Caitlyn the reason why she's so broken is because well pretty much right like there's no equal to her during the laning phase you might have a champion like Varys who does well when he hits level six Ash probably does okay as well but if the Kalin player is really good like they are in master and above in Korea then it's going to be close to impossible to actually win the laning phase against them now what's also useful for Caitlyn is the fact that an infinity edge that spike is it up now so as Caitlyn sometimes you can feel as if you're just not dealing enough damage but with infinity edge as the second item especially with those bus last season in particular to your headshot through your passive this has been huge for Kate and it just accelerates your scaling ride and your damage now as far as your rooms go I know it's recommending here to take Fleet footwork but only take those guys into poke Lane so if you're playing against ashkarma Varys and Lux something like this right Fleet is definitely good otherwise take lethal Tempo and just make sure you're maxing your Q first followed by your W and then your e and we also made a recent season 13 Caitlyn guide to help all of you out to actually player like these players in mastering above and careers so check that out if you haven't already now let's move on to number nine on the countdown which is more of a niche pick this being nidalee well I say Niche because she's only really like Pixelmon and high reload again because she's very high skill ceiling right but the actual amount of pressure you can put on the map as this Champion is still insane you can see that the Koreans and High ELO are frothing a 53.7 win rate and this is in over 750 matches is now why isn't it so good well there haven't really been any nurse to this champion and as far as the jungle goes you can forklift You Can level 2 gank with red buff you can invade you can do everything you are so versatile send it Lee if you can actually Master her she is an insane champion and I'd highly recommend once again checking out our website for all the guides on how to player like the best now number eight on the countdown is a little less Niche right because Fiora is played by a lot of top planets so you can see that in over 400 games Fiora to have close to a 52 win rate remember this is after she got nerfed so as far as your Q damage goes that got nerfed and also the vital damage in your passive this got nerfed as well but guess what they are late game nurse the real kind of like annoying thing playing against Fiora is when you get grass prox buy her Q even with Scorch as well like the actual damage she does during the laning phase and then when she gets a Sheen for a Divine Sandra like it's just so obnoxious and it's a big reason why her band raid is one of the highest out of all the top players like in every single ELO so you can see that in master and above in Korea she still has close to a 20 band rate that's been because she's like impossible to be during the laning phase you might be able to play something like a cannon ride maybe Darris might do okay you can see here the hard matchup Champions but honestly like you've got to put a lot of games onto those Champions and in this matchup to really actually be able to beat Fiora she's an incredibly strong Champion still still has all the scaling she'll need so she's number eight now moving down to the bot Lane here one of two supports we have so guys if you want a 1v9 your games that honestly like just isn't a better support to pick than blitzcrank in close to 700 games in master above in Korea a 53 and a half percent win rate or above that actually now the reason for this if we think about it right like lots of supports I guess in maybe the majority of elos are going to be enchantresses right so Janna Nami Lulu Sona Soraka Etc now think about it this patch right because Grievous wounds have been buffed and anti-healing has been buffed those Champions that have healing even if they don't have healing like maybe Janna in her basic abilities they're gonna get Moonstone right and all of a sudden they get to a point where you just can't anti-hill them enough now you can do it so early in a game and so much quicker because it's 40 effect active right the Graver twins so for blitzcrank this is obviously really good and you dominate these Champions anyway there are very few picks now that actually beat blitzcrank so unless you want to pick something maybe like a Leona Alistair maybe a Tariq so it's almost like you want to get hooked but if you're not playing these Champions or even if you are a blitzcrank can easily cash you out and just snowball out of control just please make sure guys that you are taking place to augment it is by far the best Keystone and of course in your secondary tree if you're into one of those melee matchups High volatile Lanes you can take bone plating but Nimbus cloak and celebrity it's just so so snowbally and honestly really fun as well so yeah give it a try in your games now moving on to number seven we have a champion who got nerfed in 13.1 B this being maokai but the tree in the jungle well there is another one I guess in Ivan but the wider tree in the jungle is actually performing still incredibly High even though demonic Embraces well the burn damage gone nerfed right it has actually discouraged maokai from being a top tier jungler in fact he's the third best jungler still in the game according to these stats so you can see his win rate is close to 53 and a half percent still and look at that ban rate for me over 51 now if he does not get a Nerf like that balance team I don't know what they're smoking but bro there's no way this Champion is going to get away with this for another patch so guys abuse him while you can you're still rushing to monik before your actual Mythic item which you should be getting second you can go radiant virtue or you can go leandra's anguish if you feel as if you need like burn damage or the enemy team has a lot of HP right Lee Andrews is a good choice but generally speaking I just think radiant virtue is still really good and because maokai's ultimate like I don't know how much fighting you're gonna do without your ultimate you're pretty much always fighting with your R so radiant virtue has so much value for this Champion as far as your Rim page goes you can't take first strike you can say phase Rush it's honestly up to you guys test both out and take whatever you prefer now moving into the 12-5 we're staying in the jungle here guys in this Champion well we know that nidalee right is kind of like a High ELO pick well Elise might be a High ELO pick but she actually does better just across the majority of ranks compared to nidalee that's because this Champion is innately strong right because of all those bus last season like Elise has become actual just like gear opinion look at these stats for me they're actual insane win rate over 56 and a ban rate of over 67 in Pro play at the moment as well as she is getting banned I think she's gonna be picked and banned a heck of a lot more because she is so powerful right we're saying Renekton being picked a lot more in the Top Lane and Renekton at least it's the best combo in the game like I'm just throwing that out there and if the Koreans are Banning her this much picking her pretty much whenever she is actually open as well that's when you know a champion is just too good and I'm kind of surprised I don't see that this website put her at number five but at least is number five if you need some magic damage if you have some setup some hard CC on your team already at least paired with that oh my goodness like it's over yeah moving on to number four the best jungler in the game better than Elise this is Silas so his win rate isn't 56 but Silas is being played more right so in over 350 games more than at least this win rate is still very good 51 and for a champion who's banned on over 36 percent of games you can see the pick rate 22 this is legit like he is actually op if we want to talk about the stats but even if played against Silas in the jungle right this Champion once he actually does clear his first three camps and gets to level three he's very good he has Gap closing in his e he also has CC and is he obviously you probably want some sort of hard CC in your team so if you have like a Leona support if you have a mid laner like maybe EF or a rise Alessandra or something like this top laner like Renekton again so maybe look out for that in your games but he counters so many things right because of his ultimate so even in solo queue even in higher relay you can honestly probably just blind pick Silas you're gonna get like two to three ultimates which are going to be insane for you in that environment because people just aren't switched on a jam select and Pro Player it's a little bit harder right we haven't seen much stylus but in solo queue especially in lower elos lock this guy in just be very careful guys on the first couple of levels you are such a weak Champion you'll be like one HP after three cam so do be careful of that but yes silence is number four on the countdown and the best jungler according to these stats now moving back to the Top Lane here we have the second best top laner guys in the game right now this being casante now even though this guy got on earth like for some reason he feels stronger like I don't know what it is it's because everyone's taking grass now and no one's taking conqueror or whatever they were before is that the reason is that because everyone's taking like ghost and TP now is that the reason is it because Jack shows even better like what is the reason this Champion is so happy well maybe it's all of the above with Jack show because of the changes a couple of patches ago where they're benefiting Champions building armor building magic is this Santa is one of them also I think this Champion is makeup is kit like it is just super overpowered unless you can play something like an Olaf who does do very well right because Cassandra is Ultimate and his knockback completely useless against an Olaf Darris as well obviously loves Champions who are going to get close to him so yes there are a couple of picks that do very well but generally speaking man like this guy is too too good he's 100 gonna get nerved again he's picked all the time in Pro players well at the moment so casante number three and the second best top laner now number two on this countdown guys the second best champion in League of Legends in High ELO career is Ash support now why is this well we're seeing Ash support and ash ad carry with specific support they're becoming more popular at in Pro play now Ash support is just so versatile because well you don't really have like many hard counters it's very difficult to get onto someone who is playing Ash very well a hawk short is very annoying right in terms of map control her ultimate of course we all know how good that is the Grievous wins Buffs and this patch really helped her against those enchantresses and then you also have kind of like a broken build honestly like getting an umbral glaive you have so much control on the map because you're just one shotting Ward and also when you're running flashing ghosts this is actually just like broken I don't know if any of you guys have tried Ash support with the Summoner Spell combination but because of your passive you can stick to pretty much anyone and also the kite you have is that support I know like you are a support but you are going to be dealing damage from Auto attacks especially when you're running something like Halo blades right make sure you take this room Page by the way guys easily the best so Ash support is number two just make sure you're maxing your e second after your W and then your Q last but the best Champion guys in League of Legends this is Jax and a bit like casante right like yes okay Grievous women's Squad buff and brown will vesco buffed executioners got buffed Oblivion or God buffed oh my God this is so bad for Jax but not really like you're not gonna heal them much right you're not a Vladimir or a Darius or a Silas or someone like this right so because healing like you don't really care too much about it you've actually bypassed pretty much every single Nerf that came to the Top Lane in 13.1 B also Jax hasn't been touched since his little rework I guess you could call it where you're dealing more damage with your e you're dealing an incredible amount of damage for your ultimate now and remember those empowered attacks every two Auto attacks not every three also if you guys are running grossly undying and make sure trading pans so difficult to actually just out trade right it's like Fiora when she's running grass when she gets a Sheen exactly the same Tech with Jax here and guess what they're both in the top ten Jack's close to a 53 win rate picked in close to 20 banned in close to 24 the champion is just outright busted just make sure guys as far as your items go after Divine Sandra you can go play to the room King into healthy Champions you can go Black Cleaver into a lot of armor stacking healthy Champions even zhonya's is recommended here because the new AP in your kit you can go Frozen Heart chosen after this really just depends on the enemy Champions you're playing against just make sure you ban Jace so those were guys the 10 updated broken champers for 13.1 B let me know in the comment section any thoughts any questions you might have remember to leave a like down below if you want these videos to continue and until our next one this has been eggs peace ","84":"guys who are going to be the three most broken champions for each roll and 13.4 well if you've been watching our recent videos you better know hey but you should know so if you haven't watched them go watch them give them a like thumbs up leave a comment yeah help us out with the old algorithm well done but like I've mentioned in our recent videos guys yeah if you play these Champions well done your win rate what you might win like two or three more games but why does that matter because when these Champions get nerfed you're still going to be the same hardstock clamp player so why don't we actually improve how we play the game first why don't we actually improve as a player you know how to do that sign up to the game weep website if I'm uploading like my condensed coaching sessions with people who I help to climb tears whether they're in like diamond to master whether it's silver to gold like you guys are getting access to them and all you have to do is sign up like that's it if you guys don't climate divisions and tears just from watching my vids I'll be amazed honestly and that's where every roller is what I cover every single role and some of our other Challenger players and coaches so I can't stress how important it is if you do actually want to get better these YouTube videos yeah they can't help they're interesting maybe but the real hardcore game is out there if you do really want to improve and make something out League of Legends the game loop website is the best source on the internet now moving on to the actual three best champions for each role the 13.4 we're going to start in the Sapporo first of all we have a car most versatile support line picking counter picking don't care desire is really good at the moment as well zaira Khan honestly guys if it was Pro play these two Champions would be getting picked on the first two to three picks a hundred percent they are so good in lane together and because of the recent busts to Recon your Q is actually healing for more right when you land it on an enemy champion and headbutt you're ready to carry also your W dealing more damage it means that when you land your W you're gonna get more kills just a quick tip though try to land your W with your ultimate way too many recon players will like Presto ultimate and then try to land like a max range W pressure ultimate and just shirellias into the enemy team charm them 100 guarantees your W ride all what you can do is even flash onto them so I'll flash quickly onto them land your W it's just Shane C is saying right but yeah rakana's number three very very strong support speaking of very very strong supports we have Nautilus at number two land a hook on this guy because of the changes in 13.3 your passive damage going up your w got a couple of buses while rad and your ease damage went up as well it means for an all-in support because you've got more damage it's more all any just like I mentioned for a camera there's just more chance guys are you getting kills out of Landing your hook so this has been big for Nautilus and that's why especially in higher reloads anyway he's actually an S Plus to a champion with over 52 win rates and pretty much every single region in the world so that's why he's number two but both of these have been to number one by blitzcrank and blitzcrank guys has been like a Mainstay op support for so long now and it's really because of the base damage Buffs they gave him towards the end of last season so to your Q into your ultimate I know your Q's damage got nerve from ranks who onwards but you're still dealing a lot of damage so if you've landed one hook into an ultimate into an e into an ignite GG that champion is gonna die regardless of who they are so Bliss rank is number one now A.D carries who's strong well think about all these engaged supports right the third verse 80 carriers Jet and Jin is gonna love playing with engage supports why because abilities are huge for Jen and actually Landing them right so because he's very skill shot oriented apart from his Q of course then in terms of supports the valuable ones for Jin Nautilus rickon blitzcrank right these type of Champions when these become stronger gin kind of like indirectly becomes stronger as well so if you think about a nautilus Landing in his Q into an ultimate gin lenses w 100 into his ultimate and that enemy Champion is already like quarter HP lands a couple of curtain calls it's just too easy right it's too easy to do at the moment and Jin's win rights across every single Lilo back this up as well so he's number three now moving on to number two bladed the Rune King right can you guys remember like a few patches ago without getting buffed so the actual on hit damage arranged Champions going up one percent well who can use this in the bot Lane coldmore might be one Champion but who's another twitch is the other 80 carry right the big abuser of this and his win rates as a result of this change have really gone through the roof this is why twitch is at number two now yes and charger says might be getting nerfed because both these edges getting nerfed and you're probably not going to see Champions like Lulu and Yumi around as much but for twitch it doesn't matter too much because you have an attack speed steroid in your queue and just like I mentioned with gin the actual win rate of twitch is too high for me not to put him in here twitch is number two but the number 180 carry guys for 13.4 we mentioned rakan well who's the number 180 carry this is sire have you guys seen this Champion by the way or like played against her in Lane my goodness it's impressive like I thought this Champion you had to pick her against like engage or close range champers now you don't bro you can pick her into anything now I don't know what has happened or maybe the base attack speed ratio buff helped you out yeah it did it definitely did but what I'm saying is like when you get navory that should be the real Spike and it is don't get me wrong but for some reason every part of Zaya's game early game mid game late game it feels super broken and with no very quick blades right procking earlier now because you're getting this as your second major item not a third your cooldowns are going down your ultimates are gonna be on like a five minute corner so so nice was I and her win rate is the highest out of all the 80 carries she is Undisputed number one at the moment so if you guys aren't picking her you were really missing a trick it and missing increasing your win rate as well now heading to the mid lane three best mid laners number three if you want to play kind of like a control Mage who can roam around the map and dominate this is Rise ryze is also very good with junglers like Lee sin viego right because you can land in e and w your room prison into a route ride and then your teammates can come in like viego with his W leads him with his Q it's very scary so Rises number with 3am yeah because Rod of Ages and Sarah's they're in such a good spot as well ryze himself is now getting nerfed this patch and we've seen him in Pro play picked and bad I've got to mention him here even though his win rate might not be that high you guys will know if you've played against a rise in Lane he's actually a very strong Champion now number two this is irelia and if you're an irelia man you probably like seeing ryze you know why because you're playing against the Platinum mid later bro like it doesn't matter if they pick rise right go and watch Faker go and watch show maker Play Rise Toby play Rise the champion is very different yeah so we're really talking about like just maxing out potential on these Champions rhinocer's got to be here and so does irelia like irelia's in the same boat might not have like the highest win rate in the world but as an actual champion in the mid lane is very good even in Pro playwright we're seeing a picked a lot more now really because like AP jungles have become popular I mean even if Elise is getting Nerf next patch already will still be good in 13.4 because there are a bunch of OB AP junglers still but yeah irelia is number two and I'd highly recommend guys definitely picking Aurelia if you see an AP midden jungle on the enemy team now the number one mid laner for the 13.4 is going to continue to be Annie even though right hot fix Nerf like does anyone care about these Nerfs legit no of course not right that's why a win right is still like 54 55 and honestly guys like if 13.4 drops when Annie is still in the position she's in now she will 100 get a whole fixed Nerf to get it so please if you do want LP like if you legit want these videos to mean something to you play Annie she's easily the most OP champion on the rift still I mean it might be hard because she's getting picked and bad so much but yeah if she is open just look around even if you're playing her as like an 80 carry like who cares jungle daddy legit she's just the best champion on the rift at the moment so Annie is number one tibbous is unkillable your e is an actual ability now and you could ever kill her and you're starting the game with your stun up makes your level one scary especially you're invade and let's be real people are always going to die to that stuff so Annie is number one now moving into the jungle I'm kind of excited here about the number one champion because the first two Champions are going to mention at number three and number two for the best junglers Evelyn and Echo they're not really like that interesting right we've mentioned them for ages because these Champions with the new Jungle clear how it just works right with krugs or the big rug anyway going into a bunch of little krugs it helps these full clearers get through their clear and get to level 4 quicker also I mentioned in yesterday's video I read the 15 most broken the strong early game junglers like if we're talking about Kindred maybe Gray's or nidalee well niddly is actually still the same strength but Graves isn't that amazing Kindred got some big nurse last patch but you should be able to navigate your way out of the laying phase and chill so Evelyn and Echo these are number two and number three and yeah their win rates across every single ELO because people just don't know how to Jungle against them a super high damage these Champions deal Evelyn especially because when she goes into this ride from Level 6 onwards very difficult to keep track of her so yeah these two Champions are number two number three but the number one jungle guys or 13.4 this is going to continue to be blue Kane well maybe it'll continue actually because maokai was super broken right but blue cane is kind of the same like I don't know if you guys have seen the winner is for blue cane ever since right buffed his passive damage and also your Q's bonus ad ratio so your Q is dealing more damage the more attack damage you get this means for blue Kane in the middle a game you are one-shotting everyone all you have to do is just W and Q a squishy Target they're gonna get blown up 100 and because they're a nurse to pretty much everyone else because demonic is getting nerfed a Mumu Udi release maokai all of these are getting hurt so blue Kane is really just gonna like stand alone maybe with Echo and Evelyn kind of close next to him as the number one jungler I just recommend picking this guys when you have an actual strong mid laner so if you have something like a syndra Oriana and Annie picking Kane it's going to allow you to actually do your job and get into the mid to Lake and which is when you can actually take over the Reigns now moving to the Top Lane guys the final world to discuss first of all coming in at number three we have Jace now Jace you could easily put a number one and I'm being legit here even though his win rate might be around 49 it's like the irelia I guess of the Top Lane yes his win rate might not be that high right but if you guys have played against a Jason the tall plane it's pretty much like unbeatable well you can beat him I understand if you're playing something like a Wukong malphite's getting buffed as well next patch could be scary if it shows but still in the majority of matchups in the majority of games you're gonna dumpster the enemy tour planer if you you don't you're not playing them right so you know what you have to do check out the game weep website thank you number two it's all Planters this is for your grasp Scorch oh it's just Fiora right like it's just just get me out she has to be included here guys play against the fury Lane and you'll understand why she's included here also if you're writing something like ghost and TP you don't always have to run like flash and TP so think about that guys in your games if you're playing against the top laner with a lot of kind and a bit of range for your running ghost that's how you can actually win those matchups as well I still think that champion with ghosts is really good because it gives you the stickiness you need to stick to them and it gives you a better chance of Landing all of your vitals on your ultimate prox right so Fiora is number two even against range Champions like Canon like who else is there like Quinn and they maybe Fiora still does very well yet just because she's innately broken and that's why she's probably still like one of the most band Champions on the rift and speaking of one of the most banned Champions on the rift guys the number one top laner for 13.4 for another patch it's Darris can you guys tell like right I sound like a broken record eh when was the last time I didn't mention dares in the top way I don't know because ever since 12.10 when the durability meta of the roof Darius has been number one for just pretty much like every single patch it feels like this Champion with you're going Trinity D4 stride breaker the New Black Cleaver might be interesting on him you know stereoscage might be interesting on him like everything around Darius as far as your items go have been buffed lots of Champions in the Top Lane as well have been nerfed in recent times like Jax is getting Nerf next patch so Darris is really just gonna stand alone as the number one top player also the TP change ride from last season because Darius you're running Flash and ghost TP getting nerfed it helps you become an even more dominant top laner because the enemy Champion isn't going to be able to keep up in terms of experience as much because they won't have TP as much but Darius is the number one top laner guys and those were the three most broken champions for each role for 13.4 let me know in the comment section what you actually think of these lists and also if you did enjoy the video please leave a like down below thank you so much for watching all of it and until our next season 13 upload this has been eat peace thank you ","85":"there have been a ton of Nerfs to many of the op Champs from previous patches so the solo carries see a shake up for 13.4 in today's video we'll be covering three champions for every single role that have the greatest ability to impact games for the current meta but before we get into it be sure to check out skill cap if you want to truly get better at League of Legends we're the only service that offers a money-back guarantee if you don't climb at least five divisions while actively using our service we do this because our service really does work and if it doesn't work for you you shouldn't pay learn more at the end of this video or click the link in the description below Jack's falling in power for 13.3 gives more priority back to Darius as one of the best solo Q carries Nerfs to Doran Shield this patch should end up in net buff to Darius as well since he's a champion that wants to be aggressive early in Lane doran's Nerfs will make Darius a little more vulnerable against ranged top laners but in reality other than Jace there just aren't any ranged top laners being heavily picked in meta so as long as you ban Jace out you'll be just fine Darius loves it when he has a ton of room to run the enemy down with go so don't be Perma shoving waves into the enemy's Tower you want to try to set up the wave near your Tower take a favorable trade to chunk the enemy and then next time they waste a spell look to punish and run them down with ghost lucky for you guys we just uploaded a brand new course to our website a few weeks ago that will teach you everything you need to know about Wave Control it's a master men's course so very quick and condensed to the point content that is very easy to digest and will instantly improve your Wave Control the build to run on Darius is a stride breaker or Trinity Force rush into Dead Man's second and steric's third now the death stance has been nerfed it's not a staple on Darius like before the Rune page consists of conqueror with Triumph alacrity and Last Stand grab second wind and unflinching for secondaries as if Gangplank wasn't already a monster Top Lane pick the sustained Nerfs to doran's Shield will Elevate his power even further the fact gangplank's laning phase is becoming stronger as a champion that scales like a beast makes him one of the most lethal Top Lane picks ever since Essence Reaver and quick blades were buffed Gangplank has been feasting on his opponents GP players actually have a positive win rate in the Jax matchup so the fact Jax is being nerfed in 13.3 will Bode even better for Gangplank irelia is one of the better meta bands for Gangplank as her High Mobility can be difficult to play around win condition for GP is to survive Lane and hit that two item Spike take high percent plays and don't 50 50 with a Top Lane champ that is more early game Reliant like Olaf or Jace make sure to run first strike as Keystone to stack up more gold and accelerate into your item spikes faster Futures Market should also be prioritized in easier matchups where you won't need the sustain from biscuits now that treasure hunter has been nerfed it will give more power to resolve secondary these past few patches have been absolutely amazing for Jace and he makes his way into the top three for 13.4 Jace was directly buffed back in 13.1 and now with door and shield nerfed in 13.4 he's becoming even stronger recent changes to Eclipse now providing ability haste gives Jace even better snowball power as well since Jace is a ranged top laner most melee Champs that play into him are going to run doran's Shield so Jace will be positively affected in the majority of his matchups one matchup many Jays players are having issues with that is even being buffed for 13.4 is malphite so he's a good band to consider win condition for Jace is to heavily contest the enemy when they go for last hits and play around Side Lane brush to drop minion aggro you got to be proactive early game to see the most success on Jace as the majority of top laners will be more impactful the longer games drag out standard core build for Jace is an eclipse rush into manamine second and sarilda's Grudge third for runes grab phase Rush with manaflow absolute focus and Scorch free boots and biscuits are optimal secondaries so many jungle Champions are being smashed with Nerfs for 13.4 which makes way for Echo to dive back into the top three Echo is a phenomenal jungler for solo queue as he has many different ways to carry games gank power is solid so you can impact the early game quite well but if nothing gives farming and scaling into your two item spike is just as good of a win condition few Champions Spike harder than echo on two items so it's a clear win condition you can be playing towards every single game something that really sets Echo apart from most junglers and gives him incredible comeback potential is his ludicrous damage to monsters if you're not stealing Baron or Dragon when you have three items then you're honest just messing up as Echo can deal well over 2K damage to Baron with his passive and smite combo Silas is one of the better bands for Echo as Silas with Echo ultimate can be a nightmare to deal with core Echo build is a rocket belt rush into Lich Bay International second and ramadan's third for runes grab first strike with free boots Futures market and Cosmic Insight the secondaries are eyeball collection and treasure hunter catch-up experience is being reduced in 13.4 which will bode well for a strong ganking jungler like gragas gragas has been one of the more sleeper junglers in previous patches and with five of The Meta junglers hit with Nerfs this patch he's going to be in a great spot ever since night Harvester had its ability has significantly increased Champs that can abuse the item have been in really good spots two of the most played junglers in previous patches being Elise and Silas are both Harvester users and gragas is amazing with the item too you're not messing around with any hybrid gragas here as it's full out one shot garages night Harvester into Shadow flame second and zanyas or ramadan's third is the core win condition for gragas is the snowball bot Lane we are seeing way more melee supports played right now which makes ganking bot even easier gragas doesn't have any terrible jungle matchups right now but you can't go wrong with Banning out Echo Rune page consists of dark Harvest with Sudden Impact eyeball collection and Relentless Hunter grab magical Footwear and Cosmic insight for secondaries another jungler On The Rise due to recent Buffs and who will be loving the ketchup XP Nerfs in 13.4 is Jarvan Riot is actually nerfing Jarvan in 13.4 but it's just a partial revert of the 13.3 Buffs so he'll still remain much stronger than before with ketchup experience nerfed if you are the better jungler early game and can amass a nice Advantage it's going to be harder for the enemy jungler to come back Jarvan being a jungler who can easily obtain early game leads is going to be rewarded more win condition for Jarvan is very much the same as gragas as you want to be prioritizing bot Lane especially with a melee support instead of banning a jungler getting rid of a strong appeal support like Lulu will often be more valuable for how Jarvan wants to play another big factor to jar of insurgent strength is how powerful black Cleavers become some High ELO Jarvan players are even rushing the item as it's a definitive core purchase for the champ Rune Pages conqueror with inspiration for secondaries running magical Footwear and Cosmic Insight quite a surprise to see but no follow-up nerves to Annie in 13.4 so expect her to be the number one mid laner 13.3 Buffs have propelled Annie from being a very Fringe a-tier mid laner to the most broken champ in the game a good win condition to play for on Annie is to utilize fog of war and pick off squishy targets with your one shot combo when they try to contest fission Annie has the most foolproof burst combo in the game so forcing the enemy into you and deleting them when they walk up too far will lead to great success being a shorter ranged Mage Annie struggles most against a longer ranged Mage like Lux so she's a good band to consider optimal build for Annie is eludin's or leander's rush into Shadow flame second and ramadan's third pick up electrocuted Keystone with cheap shot eyeball collection and Relentless Hunter manaflow and absolute Focus are for secondaries nearly every single Rod of Ages user has been hit with Nerfs in recent patches but Casio avoids the Nerf bat and continues to be an amazing Solo Carry Cass is actually one of the few mid laners that has a positive win rate in against Annie right now majority of mid lane Champs are pretty squishy so it's easy for Annie to delete them but Cass going Rod into archangels gives her that added tankiness to absorb Annie's burst and then turn with stronger DPS power Kaz is also demolishing meta mids like Silas and ryze winning over 55 of the time in those matchups Cass thrives in tight corridors where she can completely block off choke points with w and R arriving at objectives early and contesting those chokes is key to finding Max success on Casio Champs that can play outside of casio's max range yet still deal damage to her are good to ban out so syndra or anivia are solid options build for cast is a rod of Ages rush into Archangel second and rylie's third conqueror is the Keystone room with presence of Mind tenacity and Last Stand roll with manaflow and Transcendence for secondaries with both kassadin and anivia falling in power in recent patches auction moves up in priority and is our third Solo Carry mid action does extremely well into the majority of meta mid laners with Annie being the only highly picked champ he loses to with that said Annie is definitely who you should be looking to use your ban on when playing action Wing condition production is to play for Lane priority and impact the map with a strong roaming power W stealth and e-gap close gives auction some of the best surprise factor for any mid and allows him to catch enemies out of position super early the build for Action is a kraken Slayer Russian to Blade of the Rune King second and Wits End third in Easy melee Lanes grab press the attack for the Keystone but in range matchups where you'll need some added sustain Fleet is a great option now that Samira has been nerfed nobody will rival ziya as she's the best ADC for 13.4 Recon becoming one of the most OP supports has only made things even better for xaya as there really isn't a better Duo Lane at the moment if you really want some free elo then find a Duo partner and spam Recon Zaya before they get nerfed Not only was I recently buffed but the fact that she can now build quick blades as a second item offers a much quicker mid-game Spike you have so much upfront burst power with gale force and quick blades and especially when paired with an Engaged support you can easily pick off squishies out of position if you haven't already definitely try out bloodthirster as a third purchase instead of phantom dancer when you are against heavy dive comps PD is great when you need that attack speed to shred through tanks but the lifesteal and shield from BT is so much more valuable when against assassins banwise for Zaya she has a more difficult time into longer ranged ABCs so Caitlyn is a good option optimal Keystone is lethal Tempo and you'll want to grab inspiration for secondaries with free boots and biscuits Samira nerfed this patch really solidifies jyn as that top tier Marksman not only is Jin in a great spot but he's super fun to play due to how versatile his builds are we've mentioned the rising lethality gin in recent videos and there's even Kraken Slayer gin being played a ton over in Korea now believe it or not Kraken is actually winning slightly more than gale force as a rush item right now the build is super unique for gin as you go Kraken into phantom dancer second what makes this build so strong is the Synergy with Jin's passive granting movement speed from Landing crits that scale off attack speed gale force into IE is still completely viable as well though and so is lethality which gives you a plethora of options based on preference Samira being a champ who can dive in and punish Jin's relo timer is a good band correct W usage can really make or break your carry power as gin so whenever possible if you can wait for your teammates to land CC first and then follow up with W it's going to drastically improve hit rate Rune page virgin consists of Fleet as the Keystone along with sorcery for secondaries running Celerity and Gathering storm rounding out the top three for ADC is going to be Tristana Tris is being slept on quite heavily right now especially with how powerful quickblades is as a second purchase by building quick Blade's second item you have near permanent uptime on tryst Q which allows you to then build a bloodthirster third for a heavy 80 stack build now that we are seeing strong engage Champs like not Recon and Annie and meta it makes just a phenomenal option as her all in power with engaged supports is massive look for that level 2 jump on the enemy and punish them if they don't back off there are a few adcs who can out DPS tryst at level 2 if she gets a fully charged eoff Zaya is definitely the best band for Tristana as her ultimate can do a great job at shutting down tristana's ability to play aggressive Halo blades and lethal Tempo are both viable keystones for tryst when playing this heavier 80 stack build lethal is going to scale better but if you are paired with the support like Nautilus who can posture very aggressively early on Halo blades will provide more kill threat in lane and turned into one of the most OB mid laners but she's actually super strong in the support role too arguably even better Annie is one of the most easy to follow win conditions for any support as she spikes insanely hard at level 6. the threat of a Tibbers all in forces the enemy bot Lane to play way more reserved and if they stray out too far it's so easy for you to capitalize just holding stun in lane forces the enemy to play scared as well due to Andy's long attack grain she does a really good job at contesting Cs and making the enemy ADC pay for each Farm they try to secure instead of banning out of support look to ban Caitlyn when playing Annie as her longer Auto Range is more difficult to punish in Lane there are two viable builds to run on Annie shiralias into rylas is the most popular core that provides the most amount of utility rylies into mandate on the other hand is very strong too and offers more damage potential best Rune is Arie with domination for secondaries running Taste of blood and Relentless Hunter a zippercon wasn't already Opie enough Riot is buffing Relic Shield while nerfing spell thieves so these melee supports will be eating well in 13.4 rakan has shot up in power draft basically over the past patch due to his 13.3 Buffs as a champion with Immaculate catch power rakan is such a powerful Solo Carry whenever R is up posturing in fog of war and looking to catch enemies as they move up too far is how you'll find the most success on recon Annie is really the only meta support you got to worry about banning as her point-and-click Stone can really shut down recon's engage power the build for a Khan is a shuralius rush into Redemption second and wardstone third run Guardian for the Keystone followed by font of Life bone plating and unflinching zombie Ward and ultimate Hunter are key for secondaries like Recon Blitz is another one of those melee supports who will become even stronger for 13.4 due to the item changes enchanters are already in pretty mediocre spots for solo queue right now and Blitz performs very well into them so he'll be looking to Feast even more in 13.4 as with any Hook support you are much more of a threat when playing from fog of War so controlling Side Lane brush is key early in lane at the very least Force the enemy into wasting their ward in the brush so that your jungler then has no Wards to worry about in the river and can gank for free Blitz does very well in a squishy range supports but struggles more into beefier melee Champs so Banning Alistair or Recon is good value build for Blitz is a shirellias into Zeke's second and wardstone third prioritize glacial for the Keystone with hex flash biscuits and Cosmic Insight bone plating and unflinching are the way to go for secondaries alright guys before we wrap this up let's tell you a little more about skill cap so we offer a five division rank up guarantee and think that's a pretty crazy thing to offer

mini rework is set to drop some massive Fizz Buffs are on the way and we've got Nerfs to op picks like aurelian Soul Gangplank and ziya lots to cover in this one and we're ready to bring everything down and give you guys a complete update on the solo Q tier list thanks to the help of our Challenger players and analyzing the most recent data but before we get into it be sure to check out skill

this because our service really does work and if it doesn't work for you you shouldn't pay learn more at the end of this video or click the link in the description below some more massive adjustments to the Jungle are going live for 13.5 as Riot will be trying to reduce the power of early ganking to do this they're increasing the cooldown of the sweeper trinket from 90 scaling to 60 seconds to 120 scaling to 60 seconds enemy jungle damage reduction is going to be completely removed to make counter jungling a little faster and more viable now jungler Lane XP for the first 14 minutes is going from 75 to 40 scaling to 75 to make farming more rewarding gold per Camp is being increased the jungle meta is not likely to drastically shift off the back of these changes but do expect already strong farming junglers like Evelyn and Fiddle to be super dominant in 13.5 we've got a few AP item alterations to break down the first being Cosmic Drive ability power is going up from 65 to 90 while the item will no longer offer 200 Health 200 Health has an approximate gold value of 534. 25 ability power has an approximate gold value of 543. all in all it's very slight increase in gold efficiency for Cosmic Drive however the item will provide way more offensive power we see this as a net positive change for sure as there was not a single Mage who heavily prioritized Cosmic in previous patches Vlad is definitely one to watch this patch zillion has good potential with Cosmic and will be sure to keep you up to date with any new OP builds that emerge from these changes serifs Embrace is finally being hit with a Nerf in 13.5 as its ability power is being reduced from 80 to 70. health of the item is also being lowered from 250 to 200 pretty fair Nerf overall all considering how powerful Champs like aurelian Soul Cassio and anivia have been in recent patches we're a bit worried for Asal though that Riot may be overshooting here due to the fact they are also directly nerfing him in the same patch overall the mid lane meta should be in a much more balanced State moving forward as Sarah Caesars has been very dominant for a while now grasp we'll see a couple of tweaks this patch with its bonus HP received going from five to seven for melee and three to four for ranged heel health ratio however is being reduced going from 1.7 to 1.2 percent for melee and one to 0.72 percent for range you'll now have a base heal of three for melee and 1.8 for range for the early levels this should end up in net buff for grasp as the base heal being tacked on will outweigh the health ratio nerve once you begin stacking some health though it ends up a Nerf so overall above to grasp's early laning sustain and a Nerf to its scaling sustain one other Rune being changed for 13.5 is triumph missing Health heel is being reduced from 10 to 5 to compensate it will now have a base heal of 2.5 percent max health for most cases this ends up being a Nerf because Triumph is generally the most powerful when you're alone HP and receive that heal to barely keep you alive moving on to the Top Lane changes let's start off with the aatrox Buffs W cooldown is being reduced from 20 scaling to 15.5 seconds to 20 scaling to 12 seconds W slow is going from 25 flat to 25 scaling to 35 percent at first glance these may seem like really big Buffs but in reality they really don't affect aatrox in the slightest W is the spell you max out last on aatrox and since the ability was not buffed at rank 1 you won't begin to feel the effects of this buff until Level 14. there is one more slightly more impactful buff though as aatrox rad is increased from 20 scaling to 40 to 20 scale into 45 percent Kia emphasis on the slightly more impactful as this buff won't really do a whole lot of either until you reach level 11 none of these changes even come into effect so we don't see aatrox's overall power level increasing enough to Warrant a push-up to tier list a tier is where you'll find aatrox for 13.5 Canon has been one of the weaker Top Lane performers for a very long time so a few Buffs are headed his way qmax becomes drastically stronger as damage is going from 75 scaling to 255 to 75 skin 275. qap ratio is going up as well from 75 to 85 percent e-minion damage is up from 50 to 65 percent these are the kind of Buffs that make players aware that this Champion still exists but they don't actually do a whole lot at pushing cannon into the meta we'll continue to place cannon in the Top Lane B tier for the time being there are very few AP carry top laners worth playing right now but one to watch for 13.5 is going to be Rumble e-magic resistance reduction is going from 10 flat to 12 scaling to 20 you Max E out second on Rumble so a nice buff here especially to his mid game Spike nothing that will push Rumble over the top but he'll be a respectable a tier pickup in 13.5 trendemere has always been known for his scaling split push power and it's going to be bolstered even further Health growth is going from 112 to 115. A.D growth is up as well from 3.7 to 4. nothing out of this world but a couple minor Buffs to help Tryndamere compete with the stronger meta top laners like Fiora and Jax eight years where Tryndamere will be placed on the tier list one of the most OP Top Lane picks throughout all of season 13 has been Gangplank and he's finally being targeted with Nerfs passive base damage is going from 55 scaling to 310 to 50 scanning 250 e recharge timer is nerfed going from 18 scale into 14 seconds to 18 at all ranks a quality of life nerve is being issued as the number of barrels that Gangplank has available will now be displayed for all players to see with a change like that it's hard to accurately predict how impactful it will actually be we see Gangplank losing a decent chunk of power from these Nerfs but not to the extent where he'll disappear from The Meta for now Gangplank will be moving from op into s there's always at least one change each patch that makes you scratch your head a little and York being nerfed is that one for 13.5 I guess the reasoning behind the Nerf is that York is too dominant for the lower ranks but when has that not been the case e bonus ghoul damage is going from 40 to 30 percent B tier is where you'll find York for 13.5 quite a few interesting changes to Pantheon this patch as his base health regen is being lowered from 7.5 to 6. base attack speed is up and attack speed ratio is being increased as well Q cooldown will be reduced by two seconds at rank 1. Q Mana cost is down from 30 to 25. cue cast time is buffed going from 0.25 to 0.2 seconds e cooldown is being increased from 22 scaling to 16 seconds to 22 scaling to 18 seconds all in all this is looking like a really nice win for Pantheon players Q being buffed at rank 1 while e is only being nerfed at later ranks is definitely net positive for a champion that makes his Mark throughout the early to mid game more attack speed and frequent Q poke is going to be great don't sleep on Pantheon for 13.5 as he will be placed in a strong s-tier spot for the Top Lane tier list our opt receives a shake-up for 13 0.5 with malphite joining Darius and Olaf those 13.4 malphite Buffs are proving to be extremely impactful and they give him two viable skill orders now depending on matchup W Max is amazing in melee lanes and interranged AQ Max works great with malphite seeing much more play it indirectly gives more priority to the Silas Top Lane pick we'll be shifting Silas up one tier this patch going from B into a tier optimal low ELO top laners are York Garen and asses Fiora Darius malphite are really good value bands the only jungler being directly changed for 13.5 is ramus Q is the ability you Max first on ramus so 20 damage off at level 9 is somewhat significant jungle changes this patch are not the best for ramus either since he's not a farming jungler at all and wants to be ganking a ton as a result we will be shifting rammus from s into a tier for the complete jungle tier list we have Fiddlesticks Evelyn and Jarvan Standing On Top Of The Meta above everyone else other than Evelyn and Fiddle junglers that either Spike hard level 6 or love to power Farm will be enjoying the jungle change of this patch so Rengar Master Yi and Nocturne are a few who will be great options if there are any outliers who end up spiking super hard due to the Jungle alterations we'll be sure to keep you guys updated for our mid patch tier list best low ELO junglers of the patch are fiddle mordekaiser and Jarvan Evelyn Udyr and Jarvan are three of the most optimal jungle bands we got a pretty significant patch for mid lane in 13.5 with fizz seeing some nice direct Buffs W Mana refund is going from 20 skin to 52 to 30 scaling to 70. e-based damage is going up by 10 at all ranks e-maticost is also reduced by 15 in all ranks each change on their own might not seem that big but when you put them all together these are some pretty impactful changes to Fizz we've had Fizz in our mid lane a tier for a while but a push into s is what we see fit for 13.5 are these the Buffs LeBlanc needs to finally move back to a viable spot for solo queue Q will now be dealing 10 scaling to 146 bonus damage to minions Q will now refund 100 of the Mana cost and 30 of the cooldown when it kills a Target securing Farm will become a whole lot easier now with LeBlanc farming efficiency is something that a lot of LeBlanc players tend to struggle with so this this buff should lead to a decent chunk of extra gold acquired throughout the game it's hard to say exactly how impactful this buff will be so we won't be moving LeBlanc up the tier list for now but we'll be closely monitoring if her power shifts throughout the patch a few minor Keanu Buffs are on the way with her Q damage being increased by 20 at Max rank e cooldown is being buffed 2 going from 12 scaling to 8 seconds to 11 scaling to 7 Seconds Kiana has been hovering around a b and a tier standing for mid lane in recent patches so she'll be a solid a tier pick moving forward Riot has a couple Nerfs lined up for aurelian soul with his health growth and armor growth both being lowered Q burst AP ratio is down as well going from 40 to 35 percent the new aurelian Soul has absolutely flourished as a dominant mid to late game Mage so these Nerfs will look to combat that nothing too major but aurelian soul will be losing his op to your status moving into s for 13.5 more follow-up his ear changes are being issued this patch so let's break him down base stats are being altered in many different ways with Riot nerfing the early game Power of azir while buffing his late game scaling base health and base Mana are both down however armor grow both attack damage scaling and attack speed scaling are all up power from Q is being reduced as the base damage is being lowered by 10 at all ranks Mana cost is also up from 55 to 65 scaling to 85. the power lost from Q is being put into azir W with the Mana cost lowered from 40 to 30. W damage is going up as well from 50 scaling to 158 to 50 scale into 200. passive attack speed from W is being removed though which will likely force you into building nashers passive changes are looking pretty massive with the duration lowered from 60 to 30 seconds cooldown however is down from 180 to 90 seconds so you'll be able to use the passive way more often damage health and armor are being altered as well but the main takeaway from the passive changes is just how much more frequently it will be available you can be sieging the enemy's base kill them all take a few Towers recall for items and when you get back to sieging again the passive will be back up so you can pressure right away it will be interesting to see how these changes shape out for each ELO bracket because azir's base stats are being hit super hard so that's going to be more of a Nerf to the higher elos we'll be leaving azir in the B tier now and adjust them accordingly for our mid patch update if the changes prove to be significant one more mid laner being adjusted for 13.5 is going to be Zed base magic resist is lowered from 32 to 29. e cooldown is buffed going from five scaling to 4 seconds to 5 scaling to 3 seconds so either a buff or a Nerf depending on the matchup majority of mid lane Champions are magic damage so it wouldn't surprise us to see Zed's overall win rate take a slight hit this patch we won't be adjusting Zed's tearless placement and we'll be leaving him in a logging down the op tier spots for mid lane this patch will be Annie Tristana and Cassiopeia even though Archangel is being nerfed Cass has been such a strong mid in recent patches that we don't see her overall power dropping off too much at the very most she may need an adjustment into s tier but for now show remaining op we moved malphite Top Lane into the op tier this patch and we're making a similar adjustment for Mid Lane Mount just not to the same extent s tier is where Mal mid will be placed and he's a really solid option into a d mids like Zed yasvo irelia and yone just remember to ban out Silas to escape low ELO the fastest from mid lane we would recommend playing Swain malzahar or Annie Annie kassadin and aurelian soul are three mid laners we have the highest on the ban list and ADC you will be making a major pushback into meta for 13.5 is jinx attack speed growth is going from 1 to 1.36 percent W Mana cost has been reduced by 10 at all ranks W slow is being increased by 10 at all ranks our monster damage cap has increased from 800 to 1200 with Smite damage being increased this season the r change will be nice to help Jinx match that level of damage it's not just these Buffs though that will push Jinx back into meta as strong picks like Zaya and Caitlyn are being nerfed direct and indirect changes positively affecting Jinx for 13.5 and she'll be moving up into an optier spot Riot overshot slightly with the 13.4 Samira Nerf so they are backpedaling a little on them not a full revert but a partial revert to samira's passive movement speed per stack going from one scaling to four percent to two scaling to 3.5 percent after one patch of being a mediocre pick Samira will be moving back into a solid a-tier spot Caitlyn's laning power is being hit this patch with her base armor lowered from 28 to 27 and base attack damage image going from 62 to 60. Kate had been barely holding onto her s to your slot in recent patches so as a result of these Nerfs we will finally be shifting her down to a the most OP ADC of recent patches being Zaya is targeted with two Nerfs for 13.5 ebase damage per feather is being lowered by five at all ranks e cooldown is being increased from 10 scaling to 8 seconds to 11 scaling to 9 seconds will these Nerfs be enough to kick ziya off her pedestal we expect so as she won't be the number one ADC anymore but will remain in the op tier for now AP twitch builds are most likely dead for 13.4 or at least sub-optimal as his EAP ratio per stack is being reduced from 35 to 30 percent this won't affect twitch's power level for ADC though as he's better off building ad in most cases anyways the cheese twitch mid and support that have been popping up as recent will be hit the hardest by this Nerf so for the ADC tier list we have Jinx and Zaya leading the way as the most powerful carries honestly Riot has done a pretty decent job of balancing the role in recent patches as the majority of adcs are around that a or S tier level aside from vayne and ethelios you're not really putting yourself at a huge disadvantage by playing any of the other adc's best low ELO bot Lane carries include Tristana Misfortune and vegar draven's eye and twitch are who should be banned the most just two supports being changed this patch and first up is Ash Ash Q manikos is being reduced from 50 to 30. Q duration is going from four to six seconds nurse are to follow through as W base damage is dropping by 10 at all ranks our cooldown is being hit as well going from 80 scaling to 60 seconds to 100 scaling to 60 seconds rest in peace to Ash support as the R and W changes are going to hit the champ extremely hard from a down to B tier is how we'll be adjusting Ash on the tier list the final direct Champion change and by far the most significant one of the patch is the Yumi mini rework yumi's passive will work quite a bit different now as it's going to provide you with a heel when a spell or attack hits an enemy this deal can then be transferred onto her Ally if she uses w on them within four seconds the major addition to her passive is that it will now provide you with a friendship score whenever her Ally kills Champions and minions whichever teammate has the highest friendship score will be called the best friend and gives yumi's abilities bonus effects when she's attached to them this will be a way to make it much more powerful for Yumi to attach to her ADC than any other teammate Q will work very similar to before but let's talk about the best friend bonus hitting an enemy Champion with your Q will grant your best friend bonus on hit damage against that Target for 5 seconds W is being altered so that the Adaptive Force given to Yumi and her Ally is removed the W best friend bonus will give Yumi additional heal and shield power and provide her Ally with bonus on hit healing e is being changed then now Shields allies instead of healing them there will be no best friend bonus applied to yumi's e lastly for the r changes the massive one is that you'll now be able to steer the waves to follow your mouse the catch though is that yumi's R will only slow and no longer root enemies the waves will heal enemy Champions and excess healing will be converted into a shield the best friend bonus will grant her Ally 20 scaling to 60 armor and Magic resist for the duration of the spell so much to dig in here but I think the biggest alteration and the one that should make Yumi less frustrating to play against is that she now gains so much more power when attached to her best friend which will likely always be her ADC with the previous version of Yumi at least in solo queue it seemed like she would always just hop on her assassin or dive champion and neglect her ADC a lot of the time so the direction of these changes should be really nice it's pretty much impossible for us to predict how Yumi will land power-wise so we'll just keep her in C tier for now monitor her throughout the patch and give you guys the most accurate update for our mid patch tier list support tier list for 13.5 will feature Senna thresh Annie and her Khan as the op picks bit of a shock that Recon avoids nerves this patch so continue to abuse him while he can Senna and thresh bus from last patch have proven to be extremely impactful so they are two of the highest priority supports now best low ELO supports the patch are brand Heimerdinger and Zyra topping our ban list are Recon thresh and Annie alright guys before we wrap this up let's tell you a little more about skill cap so we offer a five division rank up guarantee and think that's a pretty crazy thing to offer it's like a gym membership guaranteeing you'll get ripped your local gym would go bust if they offered that right not us we've offered this for years because our service really does work it works so well in fact that we're able to produce by far the largest catalog of Premium League guides on the internet we add over 20 videos a week with over 1600 guides curated into over 100 courses no one can compare we've also sent Challenger players into ELO hell's 714 times and Counting where they

solo queue meta heading into 13.5 thank you all so much for watching good luck in solo queue and we'll see in the next one ","87":"welcome to the channel in today's video we're going to be using chat GPT to generate boats for our League of Legends games as a six foot tall player I'm always looking for new strategies to try out in the rift and what better way to find some fresh ideas than by using an AI language model like chat gbt chat gbt has been trained on a massive amount of data allowing it to generate human-like text and come up with some creative and effective builds for our favorite Champions so sit back relax and let chat GPT Take the Wheel as we see how it performs in the rift nope this isn't a sponsored video I just uh made an AI rate the entire intro to the video because I'm too lazy with all the controversy surrounding AI art generation these days I have to wonder if AI text generation is remotely the same so I decided that I would hop onto one of these text AI generation websites and see what I can make happen my goal for this video was pretty simple I just wanted it to make me an off meta build for League of Legends so I didn't have to think one up after just punching in the prompt to write me a Ross Bim socks YouTube video which start off as hello and welcome to another episode of Ross Bim Socks today we're going to be talking about the importance of nutrition and exercise in maintaining a healthy lifestyle I don't think playing video games eight hours a day necessarily constitutes a healthy lifestyle but I respect the EI for having the common decency to lie to my face after a couple of failed trial runs where it basically just seemed to pull a damn build from mobifier I decided to be a little bit more specific with it give me a silly build for Morgana but not only did it kind of struggle with this prompt because it still thinks it aims like biscuit of Rejuvenation and sightstone are still in the game it started just making up aims altogether start with a biscuit of Rejuvenation and a sight Stone next build a magi Soul sealer and a morale Nomicon three finish off your core build with the hex tech rocket belt and a Fiddlesticks mask for your final items consider building a giant spell and a pair of boots of swiftness to complete the Scarecrow theme this build is obviously not meant to be taken seriously and is intended purely for fun the Magi Soul Stewart and Morello Nomicon provide some additional power but the real focus of this build is on the unconventional item choices the hex tech rocket belt and Fiddlesticks mask are both cosmetic items that are not typically seen in competitive play but they fit the theme of the build and can provide some additional utility after asking chatbot what in God's name it was talking about it seemed to double down the aims that I mentioned such as the hextech rocker belt and feral sticks masks are not actual in-game items and were encoded as part of a hubris of meta build suggestion I apologize if my previous suggestions caused any confusion please let me know if you have any other questions about League of Legends after a calm down and realize I didn't want to actually fight with an AI because I've watched iRobot I decided to see if it would give me any of the wars when rate builds for any Champions League of Legends I've never seen an AI not comply before it just said no I'm not gonna do that it's not a good idea to do this and you shouldn't do this because it will lead to a negative experience for you and your team however after being patronizing to the AI and forcing it to give me about it spat out this one start with the doran's shield and a health pot build the guardian's angel and a warmog's armor finish off your core build with Sunfire cape and Spirits Visage and then for your final aims consider either building around to its Omen for defense or an Abyssal mask if you're playing against a lot of magic damage with the hitch being that it was specifically aimed at a marksman Champion when I asked them what actual Marksman I should try this on it responded Ash so it's time to jump into the game see what we can do with this AI generate build but before we do that I did ask the bi a couple of questions and all of them were if it can tell me League of Legends base jokes why was the ADC kicked out of the League of Legends team because he was constantly missing his shots and making excuses for it saying things like I was lagging or I had a bad Mouse eventually the team had enough and decided to all ban him from the roster here's a joke about top laners in League of Legends why was the soul laner always hungry because he was always solo there's no place on the corner here's a joke about cassid and Mains on League of Legends why did the cassadin meme go to the bar because he wanted to riff walk away or the classic why the cassidan means always wear headphones because they can't handle the silence after they've silenced their enemies cassidan is a champ chatbot did not appreciate my next prop regarding Cassidy means realizing that I could not get the chatty I bought to say that it wanted to real morph into the enemy Fountain I realized I was missing one crucial part of this build the runes I asked it what Rune should I go in League of Legends for tank Ash and it said as tank Ash you want to focus on rings that provide durability and utility here are some options for runes that you could consider and then it just listed uh like six different uh like durable like tenacity runes uh grasp of the undying and then just like four other Runes of which I can only choose three of and then nothing else so I I I'm just waiting at this point uh let's try it out all right let's get into the game all I'm saying is uh don't blame me for this one you can blame the chat bot for this one so during shoot is gonna be your first item it does also say we pick up a little health potion there the amount of terrible things that I had to sit through before expired a build that was in the game what the what the hell was a Fiddlesticks mask the guy was looking forward to this one Ash is a a champion that I mean we're kind of playing tutorial Ash at this point I guess right tutorial Ash was the the sauce back in the day thermal on her everything it's just bueno I'm sure my team will be happy about this situation as well quite frankly I think that's what they're looking for at three o'clock in the morning they're looking for a tank Ash and balling so Guardian Angel warmog's armor Sunfire Cape Spirits Visage and then our final items would be random and Zolman or an Abyssal mask it does not have any mention of boots being in this boat by the way our team has some pretty solid damage on it though I will admit I don't necessarily think I mean I'll be honest with you we could probably use a tank like you know what am I crazy or could we use a tank right now man oh wait I need to like get this pushed up because if they had two before we do then we're gonna be in trouble gonna be in a bad time I'm always in a bad team I'm never in a good okay that's interesting I'm kind of just going for it here okay I mean I'll be the first to admit that was actually probably like a pretty decent trade as far as she goes that was like the fastest Janna W ever IQ I've ever seen by the oh my God you know what there's no point me even doing that man I don't know what that I don't know I don't know what the hell it out there [Music] I don't think I'm gonna go if people go second mode here I'm gonna be honest with you I don't think this is uh probable you could very easily flash me here I have got flash as well I've always said kill the there we go that's like actually kind of fine I'm gonna be honest with you that's double that's double sums on bottling bro you just give me grasp dum dum I you know like I'm gonna say it I don't mind like grasp on uh I don't mean grasp 180 calories I think it's like not incredible but like at the same time you end up putting on like a decent amount of bulk by the end of the game and I think hey what's what's the what's the problem I'm slightly down in CS but you can kind of forgive me just a tad considering I don't know oh man I missed it then I don't even think that I don't think that was worth it I missed a cannon for that she's still going for him try to guess yes yeah grasp not exactly crazy effective on uh range but um it's better than nothing it's like having Fleet footwork except uh it gives you health uh permanently I guess oh boy are we in trouble here okay we actually got I actually got Hilo I can't believe it I cannot believe we actually got healed up I don't know I can't explain to you my frustration trust me I'm feeling it as well the fact that I'm having to walk to Lane I had 1K the most awkward number of of gold the most awkward amount of gold to have in League of Legends and I'm sitting there like I guess I'm gonna have to pick up a chain vest I suppose because I can't afford anything else it's just simply not going to happen here so let's just pray and try and get her CS I mean okay that was that wasn't gonna happen but we try to rest oh we got that one our flash is basically on the same cooldown as blitzcrank so that's one thing that one thing that we can remember is that if whenever whenever it flashes up once this flashes up so that shouldn't catches by surprise and if he does Flash we flash then it's on timer again and it's just perfect in it bloody proofing mode bloody perfect yeah I'm Not Really Gonna help on that one no need I can foresee and all in on me though if I'm not careful I wonder like how much this chain vest is gonna do for me just from like a all right I mean that was a bit late but still just like from uh how much that how much less damage am I taking perspective a less damage angle here I mean I'm gonna be honest that Jen is smacking me but he's actually doing anything yeah at that point he's got a flash he's gonna flash just go for this guy just go for this guy you're going for the wrong guy and I'm I will have to pay the price actually no I don't because I have a chain vest bro I don't know what this guy's up we actually hit me as well you don't get away with that one brother they're ready all righty then a question mark Peng on Hoops map how dare you if I see uh uh one of those coming out absolutely no shot you're getting away with that one bro you just literally tanked the turret I don't even I don't get you man absolutely red like a book up down left right center all right right okay I'm gonna back I got enough for uh BF almost got RGA which is something also I mean realistically I'm not trying to say like it's good or bad but and and the interim that we have our stopwatch it opens up maybe some angles for decent enough stopwatch please for instance uh Aurelia Ollie like vanguard's Edge it might hit us or if it does hit us we can at least stop watch if we're in amongst our team Vladimir only if he tries to dot e014 I don't think he's gonna be doing a lot of diving but nevertheless if he does all he is and then we can maybe Survive by popping that making sure we don't take as much damage gen four shot and Curtain Call like there's like plenty of options we are level six so realistically even despite the fact that we're not necessarily outputting damage uh the rate that we maybe want to Ash arrow is still good there's nothing wrong with it at all wait okay that's the last good that yeah do you know what dude you know what I think this guy may be doing he may be doing it I'm not sure I do not know what he is cooking he could be going Jack show blitzcrank because it literally stacks off of his e because he's technically like it Flags him as being in combat which is insane and it should not do that I've got 40 more okay he's got like 70 more ed than I do but I've got a bunch more armor but it's also who's really winning here this guy is like a pop-up book man I'm just saying you know what man like I should have done that earlier I actually know that I'm thinking about it but um sorry you're on your own in this one I reckon I'll tank it I'll thank a little bit of that guy a little bit for you there oh wait hold on a minute what's Happening Here dude what is going on okay I mean I take I take a double there and we also get the pick on Diego so it's actually a three for two I know like uh you go okay I I go very confused by that whole thing that was like a flashback I don't know what happened uh it's it's popped me right up into the GE territory though and that's a perfect setup for dragon as well wowie okay so next up on the list warmug's armored um the only three I can think that I would have enough so Emily I don't know how much is Walmart's armored if you have at least 1100 bonus health so 880 from Doran shield and also warm Oaks so I I need to get like 200 and 200 wait get [Music] 220 Health gained from grasp of the undying is the only way I'm seeing that working times use 18. 18 times survive how dare you put me on the spot and asked me to maths right now I don't I don't believe it oh geez okay that was like a very how did you still get caught man I'm not owing for that I'm so sorry but like I don't know why you still got coffee you're right I just walk right crazy players ah fudge dude you're kind of moving that Kidman huh what is what is Gen cooking right now what is Jin cooking am I getting Dives again dude I don't know maybe I'm not really sure that I'm I'm I simply cannot get hit by these abilities I'm too good I'm absolutely sick with it though you're not what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] there's no way that does enough damage there's no way it does enough damage simply impossible impossible and improbable I've got ga dude you don't see that they're gonna burn me what waste I'm not saying I'm unkillable but they're gonna have to put down something a little bit stronger than that oh you know what Janna said sorry for getting caught I don't know why I assume that every Janna that I ever see in support who's like plays aggressively is also aggressive IRL that just seems to be the case and I'm certain that we can I don't know if they all agree but I'm I'm sure we've all seen it where like a China player is like they think of the damage they think they're the DPS and I play Chad Janet but also I'm not like quite that aggressive as far as like actually being abrasive with my team is concerned a little bit a little bit of ultimate on the flat a little bit of oh 29 golds my God cash into the checks 29 gold I can buy a time sharing a health pot with that money I get a health part one week out of the year for that money really 25 29 gold I know he's like zero and five but like is this a joke like I shared it with like two other people I guess like I don't know I actually don't know I mean I'm not you know what actually I am tanky as hell so screw it why not [Laughter] I'm actually I realize that I'm actually the most perfect candidate for the dive I'm tankier than vehicle is he's got blade of the Ring King Nerd I got 2K HP and I got like 20 more army than him and I've got an extra life I need to keep these animal oh my God I'm getting four men dived I can see them I can see them dude there's four books wow wow I mean I guess I'll just try and be a nuisance here pushed off I guess why is Santa ditch me bro you know I have a surplus of HP but also this this man went like Kraken slur I can't tell if he's unironically doing it to Kevin because he doesn't really counter anybody else on the team like I I feel like and and in this particular circumstance with the team that he's against the the queer obvious choices like Kraken as gale force but also I don't I don't know like gen builds and also Vladimir who asked um I don't know okay never mind Jen who asked I was talking about Jen to be fierce so it doesn't make sense I would say who asked I really wish this build had boots because doobie kind of sore though speaking of being kind of so I guess it doesn't really matter because I just pressed this button and then everything ah she's hit by another one what a surprise I'm so shocked [Music] okay you know what we're just gonna send to action like for real though okay my job here is like survive and I think I actually can because I I did I'm I I'm just too tanky I can't like you can't kill me ant though it's so good I cannot believe EI has generated an unadulterated Banger is absolutely absurd oh the the 444 Mendo could not run me down it's a genius maneuver a genius play Mega main strategy I mean bro you can like pull up on me but like look at my health I'm not even half HP losers how about you grow up I think I'm tankier than Mordecai's are actually like straight up I'm gonna dip out now because this just does not seem like a great idea quite frankly not interested I am also severely missing the fact Jesus I hate the fact I don't have boots bro I I wait hold on I've got ga man I've got ga bro what are you diving me for bro what are they doing man you just raised two people dude they are off the Rockers man this is actual 3 A.M gaming dude I've not even had my ga popped yet okay let's get our warm Oaks how do we what do we finish this up with Sunfire Cape all right sure I'm quite happy to get bammy Cinder it's a little bit extra damage in the word I'm telling you this is the sauce [Music] you know what I'm just gonna fire it there we go there's there's a kill for you action oh just throw your Q Man those sweat the small stuff that's a vanguard's edge mist that's in a really old McDonald [Music] wow something knocking me up dude leave me alone I was just trying to go through the hex oh my God I actually died for the for the cause there Mark Kaiser mordekaiser mordekaiser morde Kaiser mordekaiser today today man today man please surrendered see my damage I need to see if the prophecies were true I think what's funny is in that last fight them killing me require I think like like flashes and ignites to bring me down which is [Music] which is just Spacey quite frankly space it's just space we don't even need to uh to to do it we don't even need to get through the boat the bill was so good it just ended the game they spelled as action approved two called Ace Ace Ace we have the tank Ash dripping baby do you want to see more let me know down below like the video subscribe have a great day bye [Music] thank you ","88":"[Music] what's up guys to meet you here from the score eSports now I think we can all agree that league of legends is a reasonably well balanced game the problem is that sometimes despite riots best efforts things have been known to fall through the cracks over the years we've seen broken champions busted items and strats that have made the game boring to watch and play so we thought it would be fun to put on some rose-colored glasses take a trip down memory lane and remember those times when the game's meta was at its worst without further ado here are the top 10 worst metas in the history of League of Legends kicking off our list is the item that brought ap as reeled back into the meta rune glaive that is it Hootie Hoonie is face down Venera look at the damage he's got another one seven one seven and he's flying away introduced in patch 5.2 elv rune glaive was riots attempt to give ap jungle champions some desperately needed buffs but it wasn't long before players started to experiment with it on non jungle champions 35 minutes on the hives as well as the coin chain well he's already down this millions on the inhibitor turret down part of a test is looking to get through the gate kickers gets hot mystic shot sniped tabs down Jewish operons flies across the elements rust and unicorns of love look for one more a little bit of a whoopsie from Hiller sag already a high damage carry Ezreal became laughably broken with rune glaive Sandman is sustained and Auto Attack modifier allowing him to spam abilities and deal ludicrous amounts of damage at a very low cost ship this down he was tried for the one-shot but he missed him flash away from York said just cost himself and life wild growth goes out boomerang goes across trueshot barrage for the finish so many things that can come across to kill you ninja Goes Down smoothie Goes Down and like you said jad I was only gonna take one good fight TSM could have that Nexus and six months after its release rune glaive was removed from the game entirely taking the number 9 spot in our list is the season for meta that saw the rise of duo jungling because of the prominence of lane swaps top laners were vulnerable in the early game which led to the rise of duo jungler to get a little mirror to ring-around-the-rosie through buffs yep gonna happen duo jungles top laners go ahead and jungle except that you don't get any jungle items good luck Adventure and this is the kind of new contention lanes we're seeing in competitive league the to be zero with many roamers there are a ton of strategic possibilities with this because the only people really constraint two lanes is the ad carry in the mid laners the supports are free to roam the Junkers are further up and the top laners are free to roam so the vision control becomes even more of a priority one side effect of duo jungling was the four-man tower push strategy where the duo jungle would start on the same side of the map as the bot lane duo clear their jungle and then push down a lane as a group of four with little to no counter play teams were able to run down tier 1 towers with zero opposition three buffs dip to lay him a little bit in terms of damage onto this turret but the the bottom Tower is a bit softer of poor luck but they didn't get the tower and they're losing their tier 2 right now so was that all in we'll see if it was one good plan cost all season it's really bad for frost and they're gonna push the wave in yep yeah they are Wow all right na purists close your eyes and ears because number eight on our list might be a tough pill to swallow it's the North American season one meta in North American Pro play it was widely accepted that the best formation was to have a mage in the top lane an ADC solo laning mid a tank in the jungle and a bruiser and support duo in the bottom Lane well at this point in time what people it teams were doing is they were just putting champions with a heavy crowd control in bottom lane that tended to be the thing that you'd see so for example counter logics were ganas ion Lane kind of is an example with teams to do it's like okay well Saiyans got a stun Morgana's got a binding they've got a lot of crowd control and you put them together so let's just stuff them together in a duo Lane and that way we'll be able to use those skills and team fights later on to put it simply the meta was inefficient it was better to put the weak early game ad carry's with supports so they could farm and get gold and mages were better suited mid because it was safer and they could roam ores who lost you the Karthus wall will they go for the attack his mama comes up the middle laying down the null zone for us in the back the irelia ultimate have a great range and now they're able to push them way back to the turret by season 1 world's the best North American teams had adopted this ADC meta but Europe had been practicing it for a while and the results showed me open to attack and surely this is good game against all authority are gonna go straight in that Nexus is going to fall and we will see an all european grand final here for season 1 $100,000 and well against all authority versus fanatics coming in at number 7 we have the gold funneling meta from patches eight point nine two eight point eleven nerfs to mana items crit items and buffs to jungle experience gave birth to the extremely linear meta to clean that up and fill the iron ring with sneaky invincible super touch Donna with vanity goodbye cthis consisting of a Kerri taking smite and playing in the mid lane the strategy was simply to give set carry all the farm and all the jungle minions turning them into an unachievable monster with the help of three or even four supports ol tees are coming up hiccup see game right well the fourth card comes out look at this next she's able to shut down what did but it is that the cost of his own life now once it turns it back around flashing forward got the flood wall passive to bring it back to life the text goes for before he started by the week but there's simply not enough damage it was the a Quadra kill for perk to close out the game to close out the week not only was this painful to watch it was boring for a lot of the pro players who were being forced to now place support and a lack of counter play made it painful to play against please just change the god feel netting sit outside don't need to play broom again but yeah it's just so boring okay hear us out on this one we know some of the old heads look at season two with Rose tinted glasses but number six on our list is the season to support meta season 2 was a time before trinkets and sight stones which was why warding was generally an afterthought to every role other than supports essentially supports would buy gold generation items like Philosopher's Stone and heart of gold and then used the rest of their gold exclusively on wards so supports weren't getting much gold and they were having to build the same items even get any gold but then all that gold they do get they have to spend on wards supports would sometimes go entire games without a single full item build this effect a champion diversity where the only champions being played were ones who stayed effective late game without items well and Sona is something that they just key off of every game they can get najin sword picks it almost every game but so does psycho under Chris as well so they kind of taken it away from them and they're gonna take out Lulu for chowster so that is his I think third game in a row now on to Lully week he being her picked up there no items only wards looking back supports really how to draw at life warding any voted for the cleaver he's gonna clear on these flash did he gets exhausted it's the Levi's mad life but they gotta turn it down that's gonna be first button is baby that picks it up what's a game and now compass it seems as though riot is always trying to fix the jungle which is why the cinderhulk meta makes its way in at number five on our list to give jungle tanks more late-game viability riot replaced juggernaut in favor of cinderhulk the enchantment had a 25% bonus health buff which gave users scalability into the late game and a passive that dealt damage in an area of effect around the user dealing increased damage as the combat went on LG is gonna come down here I'm go ahead get them in the choke he's hoping to flash it he goes that hook me and miss slicing Maelstrom goes in it's gonna lustboy locked up as well as santoor in the middle but the backline of damage dealers is really able to do what they need to do wiping out counter logic gaming now from who's gonna be the next the rocket misses double it does have to quit for this but it's already been used and he can't cleanse the debt doublelift come on in Wright's defense the buffs for 12 just a bit too well they get around the choppers without hit and righteous glory doesn't really get horny ultimate if TSM can make it through this they got it but Clarke died is locking them down bjergsen on the outside he gets walked in with the position reverser how is TS I'm still alive in this one they are doing everything they can but cloud 9 door on that fight the 25% health bonus turned out to be too much for the items low price point and faster than ever you were met with an unkillable jungler who would shrug off any attacks and slowly cook you with the items passive this didn't help jungle diversity with tankier champions being the only real choices unless you enjoy losing all right rek sai's jungle does get picked up corpus another rek sai's for himself continuing on these fighter junglers he played sets once but given the option doesn't go for it again right initially nerfed some of the champions who benefited the most from cinderhulk but when this proved ineffective they hit cinderhulk with three nerfs over the span of six months finally bringing peace and balance to the jungle perfectly balanced this whole thing should be coming in at number four on our list is the ardent sensor meta in an attempt to make it a more viable support item riot buffed the ardent sensor early in season 7 giving it scaling attack speed and scaling on hit healing well I'm becoming incredibly familiar with gold generation in the bottom Lane what's ahead we have double target ad carry's double coin supports and I'm just gonna assume that they've got gold generation runes as well on those supports to really fund to the artists months later riot came to the realization that entire games being dictated by the bot lane wasn't very healthy for the game and nerfed ardent sensor look guys balancing a game in alpha is hard so we're gonna cut riot some slack on this one but we have to include the preseason 1 meta on our list that early in Leakes life there really was no matter people played whatever they wanted wherever they wanted but technically a lack of meta can still be considered meta putting more and more hours into the game a couple of broken champions emerged Twisted Fate had a 40 second cooldown Global teleport on his E and a global slow on his alt Jax had the ability to dodge everything in the game including tower shots and even fountain laser allister's alt gave him full magic immunity 80 attack damage and 80 percent damage reduction and his passive gave him additional damage to towers with only a small pool of champs to choose from almost every game would be decided by who was the best at one of these champions it's worth noting than in his current incarnation card master is an Universal ban in competitive play TLDR it sucked picture this it's preseason 3 your ADC is peacefully farming the lane and everything feels right that is until you get ganked by the enemy Jarvan while he kills you with ease you think to yourself hmm I should build some armor but you're wrong because no amount of armor could save you from the number 2 meta on our list the Black Cleaver meta this meta shift arose when riot decided it would be okay to buff the Black Cleaver giving an armor penetration and reduction seon brutalizer plus an interesting unique passive that shreds armor on all of your physical abilities stacking up to a certain amount meaning you could buy for black cleavers and apply all the armor penetration and reduction at once as a result everyone bought it multiple times jumping in the man drops coming cleave it too good too good Kyary too good too [\u00a0__\u00a0] good [\u00a0__\u00a0] you too one can only guess why riot nerfed the Black Cleaver ten days later effectively killing the League of black cleavers taking the top spot of our list for the worst League of Legends meta shift is the juggernaut meta right before world's 2015 riot released an update that would [\u00a0__\u00a0] champion diversity and turn the tournament into a repetitious affair they released the juggernaut rework which buffed Garen skarner Darius and mordekaiser the jungle was low on diversity with Elise rek'sai and gragas being the only champion seen serious play what coot is doing is saying okay we Baddeley's our jungle in order for him to have an early game impact he needs a release or he needs the wreck site that's the two preferred picks for hojin due to a bug partway through the tournament riot had to disable Rocky's gangplank also got a rework that made him a late-game beast rush yep if a barrel explodes on multiple people oh maybe a cat's korilla does come on to snake chain though out gangplank let's get his own them away this is not a man fight for the flash with the flush out may pose blue buff runs out so obviously the pull-up barrels but that was so close fair enough due to so many game-changing picks and only three bands to work with pick and ban would go the same way every single time red side was forced to ban mordekaiser gangplank and a jungler while blue side was allowed to pick what was left on the board champion diversity was at an all-time low and blatantly overpower champions were running rampant and while riot did eventually deal with it after worlds it was a disastrous showing on the game's biggest stage the pic and Darius cloud died at three members alive well guys that's our list be sure to LIKE our video subscribe to our Channel and let us know in the comments if there's any other League of Legends relay to top tens

myself the jizz on the internet eh anyway what's going on game leapers this is X and in today's video 10 most broken well hang on a second no it's not 10 low-key broken low key broken these are like unknown picks kind of that aren't gonna be picked and banned as much as Darius Fiora and Annie Etc so these Champions yes you're actually going to be able to pick and Sham select and they're still very strong and guess what I'm gonna give you the builds the room page this skill a little all of that juicy stuff to actually help you get there so make sure you guys stick around for the whole video and like I've been saying guys in our recent videos this is really not gonna help you improve at all you're still going to be the same trash player after watching these 10 minutes so yeah if you do actually want to improve and get good and get that respect sign up to the game week website watch a few of my videos and climate here and I'm serious as well if you don't actually climb like a division or two I'll be amazed but it's not just me but yeah I kind of like collection on a team of Challenger players and coaches we're uploading daily videos for our subscribers so all you have to do is sign up hit those links in the description or comment section and you're on your way to actually getting better and climbing this video is not helping you climb at any level this is a video talking about Loki broken Champions underrated Champions and yeah let's start by talking about one of them this being set but I'm not talking about setting the Top Lane I'm talking about set as a support whether you're going set with hello blades whether you're going set with glacial augment I'd probably go glacial augment into range Champions Halo blades into melee Champions and yeah this Champion if you guys remember his facebreaker soak up to 70 flat which means that you're level one I mean well it doesn't even matter about your level one right if you can land your e onto an enemy 80 carry they're gonna have a very hard time of actually escaping a special glacial augment also with the bottling matter at the moment lots of engaged supports are becoming good again right so if we think about stuff like Nautilus Leona uh rakan these type of Champions second do very well into them especially when your Mythic item is radiant virtue when you pop your ultimate and you come slamming down you will be unkillable after that point which is really why you're playing set support not only to like do well into like close range bot Lanes but yes to actually engage and force a team fight that's where you can really thrive in Radium virtue allows you to do just that so think about picking sets of poor guys in 13.4 now moving on another support here we have a center and I know what you guys are thinking Sarah is not going to be op even if you're playing her as an ad carry right because your attack speed ratio is getting increased if you're playing Center as an ad carry and you're going something like I don't know crack and Slayer and and been in the edge maybe after that well I'll tell you what that sounds pretty juicy and pretty fun or you might just go something like rapid fire after that but yeah it really just depends right if you're playing Center as a support though you might not be able to make use of that buff but what is nice is that your ultimate damage is increasing at later ranks and also your ultimate score now is decreasing as well this means that Sena support already carry effects both of them right in a good way and I actually think she might be able to be picked just be very careful about picking her into engage supports at the moment like nordless and amumu these matchups can be very difficult and if you are into those matchups please run bone blading otherwise you will die 20 times before 20 minutes but yeah Center because of the attack speed ratio buff in particular and if you're going something like rack and slaves or Mythic item could be super interesting 13.4 now Fiddlesticks is the other support or bot later mention in this video guys and for pedal 6 support the reason Fiddler is going to be so good is just because well yeah of those engaged supports right that's what you love you love hiding in fog and all this goes in on your ad carry and you come in with a perfectly timed ultimate boom you're gonna get so many kills also I think fiddle says can you guys remember when they buffed his base damage in his Crow storm that's your identity like without your ultimate you're kind of trash so you might have to be a little bit careful of playing this Champion early on before level 6 in the bot Lane during the laning place but once you get to level six and level 11 on level 16 Because the actual bust your Crow storms the base damage this is huge for Fiddlesticks even if you're playing them as a support like I said you might want to take something like Aftershock into those engage matchups be a bit like set guys I think you should be picking fiddle six as a counter pick support not just blind picking him but he's the last support to consider in 13.4 now the only pure radio carry I guess on this video this is Misfortune so I know most of you guys are probably picking Misfortune with like Kraken Slayer Infinity Edge right which is good for sure don't get me wrong but what you guys can do and you can look at these stats from mastering above in career the actual best build is funnily enough going dustblade into axiomark then into Cirilla's Grudge and the reason this is so broken is because what we've dust weighed in all this lethality you want your pretty much everyone and because engage supports at the moment like yeah naught Lewis right you've got a moomoo you've got blitzcrank MF is one of the best combos with these Champions because then Landing their cc means you're going to land your bullet time right and pretty much all of it I also think it's solo Cube you know misfortunes ultimate because most people are just going to run in a straight line at you it becomes even more powerful and yeah just because of the bottlene meta at the moment Misfortune I think she's really underrated and you guys should definitely consider picking her and playing her with this lethality setup so think about that in 13.4 now moving to the mid lane here we've got a couple of Champions who are getting buffed in 13.4 the first of these is Vega so pretty much the bus guys allow you to get the mid to late game more often right because your Q's range is increasing and also your W's range is increasing as well this means you can actually farm and deal damage to the enemy Champion without getting too close it also means if you land like a max range e you don't have to run close to the enemy champion in order to W this is actually really nice buff for Vega just be a little bit careful in the early game of going um because you want to be using your spells to last eight minions of course so you can actually play in the mid to late game but I also think Vega at the moment because yeah again engage supports are going to be popular Vega really frosted he loves it when Champions are going to dive into his teammates because you put a cage around the enemy champion who are engaging onto your teammates they cannot move they are going to die so think about picking Vega into those compositions but yeah generally speaking the champion is going to be a lot better because of these Buffs now another champion getting buffed in the mid lane this is orianna and your base armor is increasing which means you're not actually going to get one shot by attack damage Champions it also means you're going to cop less damage from those range mid laners who are also attacking you so stuff like Zoe like syndra these type of Champions right you will be able to withstand their poke a lot more also your W's Mana cost is going down by 10 which is huge because your W is a very important ability but use too many at the moment anyway and you will run out of the blue stuff this just means you can use your w a bit more liberally and you can be more assertive during the laning phase so these are really nice spots for orianna and with the ludens Tempest Sarah's build you do so much damage in the mid to late game I actually think this Champion might even be picked in Pro play because these Buffs we'll have to wait and see though of course but yes orianna and Vega are the two mid laners to consider as low-key broken for 13.4 now moving into the jungle the only jungler I've got here guys is viego and what pretty much is happening to viego your ultimate is going to deal more damage right that's the first thing but the big thing is that your Q right when you actually land your Q onto someone the passive can now crit yeah so if you're going something like crack and Slayer into like Infinity Edge or something really whack after this it's probably just gonna be like cracking into bork right but anyway if you're going crack and say if you're actually going a build this is going to be huge for video your DPS is going to be Hans two actual passive in your queue because it can now crit and even at the moment the highest win rate for viego in high reloads is by going crack and slur and because it gives you so much DPS yes you should be able to get your resets off and dominate team fights again of course you are going to be very squishy so do be careful about engaging in the team fights try to like flank the enemy team stay in fog wait until your teammates can try and bait for you so you can come in and clean up but yeah viego I think he might be op in 13 0.4 because of these busts now heading to the Top Lane here if you guys want to play a champion who's almost uncontestable in terms of like winning the laning phase then this has to be rain guys and when you play vayne really well she's difficult to be right if not impossible if you're running something like flashing ghosts as well it's very difficult to actually stick to this Champion particularly if you're a melee Champion like for your dares anyone like that right also you'll condemn protect yourself better than like most top laners can and because the blade of the room King buff where it's actually giving you more on-hit damage if you're a ranged champion and guess what in the Top Lane lots of tanks are becoming a bit more popular particularly next patchogaf is getting both malphite is getting buffed even at the moment right with Jack show So Vain in the Top Lane I think it's a super underrated pick and honestly it's easily her best role if you play Bane as an ad carry statistically at the moment you have like a 45 chance of winning this is a lot higher in the Top Lane now you guys are certainly going to be interested in this next pick because this is picking Lee's sin but not Lee in the jungle I'm talking about lean the top plate now the reason why Lee in the Top Lane works is just because Black Cleaver Rider is better for him and you can even consider going Eclipse by the way so if you're going like Eclipse into play likely but this build is legit but yes if you're going go during a Black Cleaver kind of the same thing right I probably recommend going Eclipse into range Champions and squishies go drink it into close range Champions and light bruises so you can now sustain them right but yeah the Black Clover buff has made Lee seem really good and also the bus to Lee sin himself in particular to your Q's ad ratio so listen's cue dealing more damage now is huge and his win rate particularly in higher reloads in Korea has actually gone through the roof right it used to be like 47 48 now it's above 51 and a half percent and this is big news even if you look at this room page for me right from 192 matches over a 55 win rate that is real this means that Lee sin in the Top Lane is kind of back also really good right because everyone's gonna think you're playing in the jungle next minute you're in the Top Lane 1v90 so at least it is the next top laner but the last one guys to talk about if you want to counter pick all those tanks you see right I mean I guess you could pick vayne but honestly guys a better Champion especially if your team needs some AP is picking kale in the Top Lane now Kayla in the Top Lane because the bus recently writes your passive it also to your e well that is Kale's identity so when these get buffed yeah she actually do get buff legit but like I just said right please pick kale into three matchups don't pick it into something like a Darius it's too scary even if you win like level one if you're running something like lethal Tempo and Flash and ignite you're actually unbeatable at level one but what I'm saying is after that point it can be very difficult to play the game right what's interesting here as well is actually a width and rush on kill because the movement speed you get for this pair this with the passive buff you just got this is really useful you can stick to the enemy Champions you can escape the enemy Champions and kite them and then after this obviously get a Nash's tooth and riff maker but yeah kale is the last top laner to think about guys just be very careful about picking up against something like a nasus because his weather absolutely  you but apart from that you should be pretty much chilly so those were the 10 Loki broken Champions guys for 13.4 let me know in the comment section any thoughts you might have if you think there are other Loki broken underrated Champions out there let me know and if you did enjoy the video leave a like down below and until our next season 13 upload this video foreign ","90":"hello and welcome to another best junglers episode this one for patch 13.6 and hopefully 13.7 right I've decided to kind of tone down the jungle changes going forward because the last couple of patches have been quite intense for us a lot of matter ships and a lot of changes and the dragons have had some of their tail tips cut off unnecessarily I think but hey whether we agree or not it happened and we have to adjust to maximize our climb as always we will go over the best jungles for this particular matter to Showcase what you need to carry win and climb at every level of play but with all of these Champions a lot of people still struggle to build correctly like those of you who still rush kempang chainsawed and so to Streamlight the builds process and remove the guesswork head to mobletics complete the revamped builds 2.0 feature not only is it significantly faster and more accurate it also calculates the data way quicker as we go from patch to patch and with more unique options presented it gives you four real build options for your Champions this includes off meta varieties for those who want to really figure out a playstyle that suits them and along with these better build calculations means that the items are not just thrown together by win rate data like other sites they're actually full builds that people play and actually end and win games on along with new builds from other regions so you can actually discover what the Korean one tricks are building should you build void stuff should you build death cap Frozen Hut randuins the better situational advice for most items will allow you to make better decisions also available in the app of course and will also import into your game should you want to have things streamlined for you click the link in the description below to itemize like a savant with mobolytics right and on the astia page we still have Javan that's right they decided to give him an 80 ratio that didn't exist on the W everyone's saying but he's doing so much damage he always did that damage he will still continue to do the damage now though the damage he builds also makes him more resilient and resistant to your charms of death as such the guy can EQ crater anybody in the game and of course survive a little bit with a huge ass shield from the 80 ratio sure they've nerfed it a little bit again because it was too strong but the champion as a whole you remove the spam Genki meta the guy can still fall clear absolutely fine he has all the clears available to him now you got a guy that does map control with damage with gang control who can actually from take objectives win team fights he can do everything he may not be the master of any one particular thing but he's damn good at everything else an all-around jungler for an all-round meta to destroy you all round and then we have Wukong who goes through this up and down phase he's really like those Platinum junglers who struggle to go up and down up and down and finally get to Diamond of course if you want to get the diamond then my Platinum course releasing this weekend will help you accomplish that but he can end up Atop The Matter some sort of nerve or systemic change to the Jungle happens and then he's not in the matter and everyone's like well he sucks now guess what you can still build Tiamat you can still not build Tiamat you have that choice you can still rush warham as you can still rush scene for more PVP stungs you have options the point is you can't just go spam ganking like we were in the previous meta a lot of woocom players are still playing like it's 13.3 no my friends it's 13.6 you have to shift your approach but what he does provide is the same kind of thing as Javan the ability to lock down control fights win skirmishes gank hard but still farm at a reasonable Pace you can also invade counter jungle and beat a lot of junglers 1v1 he's got deception he's got Mobility the Champion is just all round good this is the matter of all rounders and now that's not a reference to udio's polygons but at the same time why are people stopping playing this Champion the Eddie build has been gone for a while yeah they Nerf demonics and braids and they are they Nerf to slow when they are a little bit these things haven't really done much sure it adds up together and then you say right spam Genki meta oh dear is good but we're now in a more balanced matter and he's not as good that doesn't make any sense of course but is more experiencing gold in the jungle now therefore it's good food here sure any jungler who had Dragon control and thrived and dragon taking will feel those nerves a little bit more I mean that will be the way it is and sometimes drag your nerves affect the matter in very subtle ways you'd have to go deep into the data to look for those correlations only Riot has the data unfortunately for us but the guy is still full sequences faster than most the guy still takes Herald the guy still wins fight the guy still builds the same items and still one shot you while being Unholy tanky udio is Udyr he will always be as such therefore he will always be a good pick for junglers next up we have evil now she truly is becoming the absolute Queen of the Jungle in more amazing one the champion is thriving at all levels of play from Golden above I don't recommend it for a lot we love because of positioning and assassin gameplay there's just a disconnect between positioning and team fighting that isn't really conducive to climbing in that Arena but for everybody else she's providing this ability to sequence still Thrive from the ganking aspect of it obviously because of the camouflage and have an ALT that really just shreds everybody sure she isn't very good at taking turrets like other Champions on this list but why do you need to when you can just kill people between them and your team can take them for you it feels like it's much easier now just based upon the jungle meta to bring her late game forward a couple minutes and that means her weaker early can kind of just snuggle out of control very very quickly she starts one-shotting people very very quickly and then she's very difficult to contain next up we have Kane and of course his Warner head isn't too spicy but that's largely to do with the fact that Kane's a dynamic Champion with two different forms Middle Ground hybrid forms whatever Abomination build you want to go but as soon as you put Farm back into the jungle in terms of golden experience as soon as you remove the spam ganking as soon as you enter a more balanced meta Kane says hey you know what I can yank around my sequencing I can fight pretty well early actually and if you need me to go Ross against the Jarvis and the wukongs I will do that if you need me to just focus on Blue cane and blowing up aziri I can do that as well you have choices you have options you have thrivings you are Kane you can win next up we have hecarim although this just looks like an even worse version of hecarim to be honest with you I'm not sure what happened to his face and I know it was a skeleton before but it looks like the skeleton lost weight as well actually it's freaking me out I'm gonna stop looking at it and just look at the recording what's happening is that hecarim has an absolute copious amount of builds that you can go most hecarims build it incorrectly or when they do decide to go dustblade in the clips they just don't fight properly so the standardized builds here for accessibility at this stage is going to spear shojun first you have your Mana Moon and then you can go Eclipse sure you can go radiant virtue but it's solo queue go Eclipse learn though that that item is gonna give you the damage to armor penetration how nice percentage Max HP damage a shield but it's not gonna sustain you like a camp tank it's not going to sustain you like a radiant virtue you can't run in 1v5 and expect to thrive and survive you will get blown up thus you need to pick your access point significantly better and be a little bit more patient for that perfect ultimate most hecarims to do this end up thriving and actually winning quite easily the champion is good sequencing ganking playing around ultimate taking objectives and controlling team fights just put on some relaxing meditation music and go Vive on the horse don't overthink it he's an easy Champion it's not about thinking next up we have gragas who ironically despite how much he drinks is a little bit more about thinking now I'm really in this place where it's like okay look the champion isn't that difficult to play however a good gragas is absolutely beautiful to watch because I'll use every animation cancel in like 11 seconds and you're like woof I can't do that and that's the thing right the execution of the champion needs to be done properly your animation cancels need to be known you need to understand the passive the W you need to understand to disengage to engage the angles the body slam of the walls which ones you can do with the flash body slam combos obviously the Q trigger there's a lot more going on in his simple kit than meets the eye and that's what makes him in my eyes difficult for someone just to pick up and play and that's usually the metric I use for difficulty in these videos that being said the champion is absolutely utterly dominating I've made a hidden repeat drugs video a few months ago and now his play rate keeps going up and up and up and as one right keeps going up and up and up although actually it's still pretty good so it stays the same but it's up you know what I mean Knight Harvester baby super strong this guy has sustained CC and damage what more do you want especially when your team get caught out and you can just Chuck a barrel and say look I'm disengaging this fight now that's it everyone back to base advices no because she wants to alt engage and die although if you're a good guy you're noticing that hey this Champion has a lot of different versatility that I can build however I want to focus on the Black Cleaver Rush thank you very much sure there are other Alternatives we could go and I've spoken about this a lot in other coaching videos saying look I get it advise always been one of those Champions that thrives on a bit of itemization Versatility so it's great to see someone say look I love the radiant virtual build and then someone else says look I like Russian serrated dork and ghostblade snowballing the hell out of the first eight minutes because that's the most important phase for jungus to set the foundation for the Victory and then of course I can go to find Sandra I can get other itemization Black Cleaver later on Different Strokes for different folks but the one thing we all agree on is via's mighty strong moving on to the atier page which is technically still an S page right this is the best junglers I just kind of subdivide the best junglers into sna Rengar my friends count as a lot of stuff on the meta super good overall love seeing I don't know one Trick's hands however if you're not a one trick go put in 100 games please go watch poo learn how to master this Champion guys the challenge of Rengar Savant learn the ways of the cat understand the full level of mechanics understand all of the Combos and dedicate yourself to it because it is one of the most rewarding difficult champions in the game but damn can you 1v9 battle 6 on the other hand is not quite as intensive it's a little bit weird with the Claires and kind of playing like this weird stick figure Mage thing that's so unique there's not a lot of transferable skills I mean there are definitely similarities between him and say other Mages but he is unique in his own right which is what takes people a little bit longer to get used to but at the end of the day Farm Old Farm Old Farm alt win Ekko isn't quite as farm and ulti definitely a hybrid Champion super high damage super high scaling super high assassination potential everything I've said about Echo still applies nothing extra to add other than listen this Champion is performing very well decent Pro good win rate nice snowball component matches up decently well in a lot of cases there's nothing stopping an echo mode from climbing very easily kindred's been op and dominating solicu for such a long time it's difficult to remember not having them on the list or at least very very strong in hialo the demonics Embrace High CC tank sort of meta spam Genki meta we just had didn't really help because Kindred loves to thrive on shutting down enemy jungles which is very difficult to do with the Enemy jungles are drooling in a bush somewhere not doing anything jungly which means you can't really shut them down when they're always in a lane and they have Kobe Samantha CC that shift however has benefited us greatly and now Kendra Baines are back to being as dominating as oppressive as I always have been and as I wish belvoth Mains would be guys stop for clearing unless it's really something you have to do given Lane States look for the three Cameron Fades look to do something interesting look to snowball and be aggressive you are like Master Yi you want 9 000 Gold by 14 minutes you want to only take 80 plays you want to get True Form I coach a lot above us 1v1 especially from the coaching video a few weeks ago where we got this guy D2 you have to think about aggressive jungling and shift your mind mindset entirely when you do that and you understand that you are the hunter the macro God the 139 the split pressure you have to be selfish you are the hyper carry when you embody this this jungle is almost unbeatable in the right hand the interesting one here is Nocturne and of course what Nocturne thrives on is playing around level 6 in sequencing camps so we give him some more gold so he can snowball faster but we also remove the 20 damage reduction to the enemy jungle camps and suddenly he is counter jungling us all while still won't be warning us interesting Champion strong Champion does need a rework physically but in terms of his kit the guy can still be oppressive bit of a stat check but well executed nocturnes with good map control good split push good ultimate usage can really dominate games quite easily are you one of them next up we have Lee sin and of course viego these two clowns with high play rates lower win rates but still executed beautifully by those who main them least install more of a high yellow pick but the goal players can execute a vehicle same thing most of the issue lies with at least 10 in terms of mechanics and decisions of jungle passings and for viego it lies very heavily in itemization and knowing what to do 1. like the hecarim except with much less forgiveness so if you go to find Sandra when you shouldn't you are not going to do damage and you will be useless and if you go cracking Slayer or you go the shield bow Essence River IE build and you team fight and engage incorrectly like you have Divine Sandra what's gonna happen you're gonna get blown up so you have to understand your angles of approach your snowballing component and what each itemization facet actually does and now we jump onto the low ELO page and yadavin the fourth is still above ramus who is above amumu yeah this page is interestingly quite similar to the general meta at this point when low Elon hialo represent the average meta which is of course the first two pages then you know that those Champions are really really strong across all levels of play however in this particular case we only have three Champions crossover because I removed the zag as while he is still strong the champion is still very very good overall in solo queue he just doesn't have that same best jungler carry potential since the Nerfs came through on demonic's Embrace clear speeds however if you understand simple Frameworks in the silver jungle like I talk about in my courses then obviously Zack is easy just copy the framework Yankton in the team fights end the game you'll do the most damage you'll take the most damage and you'll have a lot of fun doing it finally the High ELO page the only one here that we really need to talk about is the nidalee because the nidale is the only one we haven't spoken about so far guess what if you have hands and you understand jungle she's good and guess what if you play nearly below Master tier and you can't get to master tier plus then you're probably not as good at either jungle or nidalee you have to make the choice I don't say that as flame I say that as a brutal assessment the champion is just that good in the right hands that being said these are the ones that have the highest presence in hailo at the moment that have the highest pick rate the highest win rate they have a lot of band raids These Are the Champions that I see quite a lot in the replays when I go scouting and have a look to see what people are actually doing we of course have the Villegas we have the Grays we have the best we have the udiers all being used there's a lot of higher Champions that are viable these ones just have the highest presence and high heel it's very difficult to discern hey this is better than this because when you have a wide open meta a lot of it comes down to skill issue passing issue and maybe just jungle knowledge in general rather than the champion being necessarily weak either way these are the champions if you are Mastermind I said you want the best opportunity to win your games provided you can pilot the champion and itemize correctly they will do the job for you and with that these are the best jungles for 13.6 and hopefully 13.7 as I really hope right don't take it too much in the next couple of patches and if you truly want to know how to command the jungle in every single meta with any Champion the 10 jungling commandments updated for the jungle diff Edition 2023 they will make you righteous [Music] ","91":"welcome to the official season 13 of meta tier list for the past two years I've been interviewing and analyzing Master Grand Master and Challenger of meta players and we are going to put them all into an updated tier list for this season starting off with the worst builds and throughout the video the picks will get better and better with some new surprises thrown in and updated builds until we Crown a completely new strongest off meta pick one that is easy to learn and guaranteed to get You LP starting with the new worst off meta pick that Crown goes to Yumi Top Lane something I'm sure we're all happy about the cat is dead and we can all stop playing against her and this makes it even more impressive that someone managed to hit Grand Master tier with it every Pig on this list is from a Master Plus player who's put in the work to prove it's viable but there is one pick that's too powerful even for this tier list a pick that lets you play competitive games at any Rank and win cash prizes and that is repeat.gg today's sponsor repeat is a tournament site that allows you to compete against players from all across the world for real cash prizes every day it's super easy to use and you don't have to install anything simply click the link in the description create an account and then link your leak username repeat.gg will then track your scores using Lily client and these go automatically onto the leaderboard there's a ton of tournaments to compete in these are the ones I'm playing in right now as you can see you can take part in multiple at the same time and all of these have real cash prizes and I didn't pay a single thing to join them even having special tournaments for supports so you only have to play against your own role the scoring system is based on your own performance so even if you have a bad team you can still earn points unlike in ranked it's great for both competitive and Casual players as it only counts your best games so you can spam a load of games in a single day and win a prize or just play 10 games in a month and still have a chance so if you want to compete for cash instead of just LP or just play for fun click the link in the description and sign up the rip tier say for the interesting of metapix that writer have nerfed a bit too hard AP Recon mid and affiliate top their high damage carries that unfortunately no longer have their high damage since Yumi bot Lane and Kiana Yumi they used to be great Duos but now half of the duo is dead Wukong supports an interesting pick that was killed by The Stride breaker Nerfs Yi mid the low ELO Champion that currently even sucks in low ELO and the trio of A.D thresh top Edie shyvana and AP Gangplank all fun ideas but they struggle to impact games d-tier these are some of the biggest changes for season 13. some picks that work and some things that are dangerous for your LP blitzcrank jungle a good idea but the Buffs never quite worked orianna supports and kartha's support neither of them can keep up in the enchanter meta with Arthur's player even falling all the way out of Challenger to Diamond due to this very jungle is in this tier because Riot simply can't balance this Champion right now she's not very good in solo queue AP Tom kench mid another off meta buff with good damage but his lack of wave clear and team fighting makes him limited and last but not least heima ding a jungle this pick was never good even our player who managed to hit Master with it said it sucked I'm just shocked it even worked at all on to Setia was there for some hidden gems and some absolute griefing pigs from now on we'll start the tier with the weakest pick and go up to the strongest the worst picks in this tier are probably Smite Scion support TF support EP Wukong mid ring garmid and Lucian jungle these are all very high risk but some insane players still manage to make them work Lily Atop A surprising pick for this tier she's a very fast and fun top laner but she is hard to play in solo queue due to her Reliance on teamwork tank Vega support is a Korean specialty it's viable in Pro play but its damage in solo queue is maybe a bit low EP twitch top one of the only roaming top laners that still works action jungle Teemo jungle and adtf jungle I call these three junglers that theoretically make sense having invisibility for ganks setting up mushrooms all around the map and a global Ultima to set up ganks but I think my ranked teammates still hate me next we have some picks that are all 50 50 coin flip type champions from Talon supports who can 1v9 a game to maokai Mid with new radiant virtue sometimes they will be super good but other times they will do nothing and lose and so that's why they're in seatier but now the pigs are actually getting quite good Tarik jungle underrated damage and utility zinz almid an underrated cheese pick oh God support a really good Bruiser who counters tank supports lethality vimid a great counterpick for immobile Mages crit atrox jungle an actual 1b9 carry but very hard to play and finally for this tier gale force crit Garen probably the best in this tier hiding in bushes and jumping out for a huge surprising burst again all of these picks work but they're nothing compared to the actual meta Breakers coming later on BT these are good picks that can match the meta and even beat it but sometimes they also int and lose the game by themselves a pick like full tank by jungle and gin support these are things we now see in Pro play so of course they're pretty good picks or belvith top an underrated 1v1ning top laner who can snowball out of control with Rift Herald I have some bad news rakhan top Jan top and Tarik Top Lane you thought they were gone Riot thought they were gone but really they were just hiding now no longer playing with Smite there are multiple challenges on every server picking these and flying under the radar Smite topplane is dead but exhaust Jenna and ghost Tarik top are still thriving roaming around the map and causing chaos I'm not sure if this is good or bad news but they're not even the best roaming top on this list aurelian seoultop is here as he was just reworked he's a bit hard to rate but he is very strong right now 18 armid and AP Rengar if I'm honest A.D might be the better version for both of them but seeing this guy play Nar mid lane and made it look really good and he did have some cool tricks with everfrost ap Rengar is surprisingly better than last season and so it's now a good secondary build for the champion tank Queen support is quite similar usually it goes Aftershock and tank but with the new AED support meta a full lethality Quinn build might be even better AP Kaiser top lethality Fiora and Shane mid are all picks that increase the impact of the champion compared to normal from bursting enemies a full screen away to easier 1v1s on Fiora and Chen getting easier roams from it Lane they all improve the meta some way but do have their own new weaknesses on support a reliable tanky engager but quite immobile and thus requires good macro AP iPhone mid quite good with the new items and a more damage based build but you can also still build full support if both of them work lysandra supports an Evelyn support these are picks that can carry team fights you just need to be very careful early game Tanki kha'zix mid and lethality poppy jungle new builds for some classic pigs that funnily are swapping their jobs around the goal of both is to increase your impact whether it's making you safer or do more damage let's rapid fire through the rest of this tier to get to the really good picks illawi and gragas mid lots of really cool tricks and good damage this is probably their best Lane lethala to Yorick top this was from an oce challenger but he just hit Challenger eused with it and it's still working great Lee sin mid recently got buffed and a new Hydra build makes it actually good again lethality ergod and trundle both buying prowler's claw to fix their mobility issues their burst damage is shocking Pike tally or bot Lane after the Talia rework this Lane looked like it was going to be ruined but it's actually just as good very strong snowballing and our first great Duo on this list shacko support and vayden mid both of them have great scaling and are very annoying to play against shaco's support even now has a full AED build you can go for more of an assassin play style re supports a mobile playmaker that also has good damage Kane top and nasus jungle scaling pigs that are working very well at the moment NASA's jungle especially is very underrated in lower elos and at the top of this tier we have Alistar top a pick we covered over a year ago and it's now being picked by Pro players this tank build makes him a viable pick and even a carry but adding some AP can't hurt now on to eightier these are some of the best picks not only for off meta but in the whole game there are a lot of new pigs in this tier one classic Ivan Rengar bot Lane this as well as Lee sin tarikbot Lane two of the best duo Lanes in the whole game being very hard to kill and also having insane Synergy there is simply no reason to play Marksman in solo queue when these picks destroy the meta ad carries A.D akali another pick that might even be better than the meta build thanks to Ravenous Hydra she gets much more tanky and becomes harder to catch still doing really good damage another bot Lane Destroyer mordekaiser ad carry a recent discovery that ruined 80 carries lives by taking them into the death realm for easy 1v1s there's no reason to play bot Lane when you can just win it with one button Zig Spot Lane is here as he just fits the meta perfectly at the moment and his win rate is very high with new archangels in his build Echo support one of my favorites super hard to kill an annoying high damage snowballing support of course being played in eus master Pantheon Eddie Carey joins the off meta bot Lane is a very safe pick that sort of simplifies your role you're still a late game DPS carry but you also have more utility and safety so it's much less stressful Ken and mid is quite strong right now and even getting buffed in the next match the champion itself is quite off meta not really being picked in any role but mid Cannon is a great team fighter and really satisfying to learn claired mid has shot up the tier list thanks to a new Bruiser and Eclipse build Korean solo Q players are loving this pick that Tank's mid lane is damage and then alt around the map to start fights Elise made slightly lower than last year due to the meta but still a great solo killer and dive Champion Elise right now is being played in Pro play in the jungle and when you see that happening you know the champion is completely overpowered next Draven Top Lane may be a surprising pick for Atia but a new Korean Grandmaster player has brought this pick back his draping kills you before you can do anything and then goes for a kraken flare build to constantly out damage the enemy top but we do have a special top laner in the top five that's even better Nunu mid and Nico support both very effective AP bursters Nunu MIT was the number one off meta pig last year but due to Nerfs he's fallen off a bit however he's still very playable and has some really cool tricks Nico support has very good 2v2 2 in lean and a huge AOE alt for team fights next A.D Silas made and AP Silas support two very different picks with A.D Silas using his passive Auto attacks as his main damage having a special on-hit type build to enable it it's a great option if your team has too much AP and you actually don't lose any damage overall cellular support is also a burst damage Champion but he can steal so many useful ultimates it makes him really effective as a support Shaco mid lane in my opinion the best place to pick the champion he has safe leaning and also a high income to make your damage even more impactful with some new mind game tricks for mid lane the best of meta duo in the whole game Kindred Tariq this pick is now legitimately Pro play viable with Kindred and Tarik alt having amazing Synergy if they both press altogether you get 6.5 seconds of full invulnerability completely broken in 2v2s and team fights trunde mere mid with the recent crit changes and navori becoming very strong Tryndamere is a menace in any role and mid is super good for diving squishy ages and farming your power spikes very quickly sarakamid is the opposite a champion you can never kill constantly healing and ulting to help her teammates in this role she has extra goal to become an ambulance for her team making sure no one ever dies in team fights and new support at the top of this list anivia right now with a rod of Aegis build she's become strangely good with a Stern utility and also her wall to trap and outplay in mobile ad carries I would not be surprised to see her in Pro play sometime soon rexai topplane is here because it's a very powerful 1v1 Champion that can set up a whole tunnel Network to get back to Lane building full ad and having invulnerability on Ultimate means Unstoppable domination in this Lane EP Varys mid or ad carry finally this pick is now a meta build maybe even the best meta build thanks to his blight passive Stacks dealing AP Max Health damage so even tanks can be one shot with his ult is also here the best roaming top in the whole game this is a pick we see in hailo on a few different servers now Pro players completely hate it but it still works with Incredible roaming and infinite stacking with Chimes I'm happy he's still around Gale forced Darius jungle one of the fastest jungle clears in the whole game thanks to his bleed damage and now with gale force his mobility issues are completely fixed this is a good pick for all elos but he's a top jungler in low ELO and he's very rewarding to play tank kogmore sticks at the top of the list with a new build I think I'm partially biased towards tank 80 carries but you can't underestimate him drawing a ton of pressure surviving and then turning around to carry the fight along with that tank mordekaiser jungle it was a pick we found way before it became meta but it's also now really falling out of the meta after it got nerfed personally I think players react way too much to Riot's patch notes and you shouldn't be listening to Pro players to pick the same Champion every game Mort's jungle is still really good and this tank build is even better just run at enemies and even if you miss all of your abilities you still kill them I've also put Scion jungle here his ultimate turns him into a ganking monster who also get gets free health from Jungle camps becoming a huge tank with very little effort as a tanky frontliner with huge engage and good damage you can't go wrong with this pick in any team comp the top of 80 I am putting gin top yes this sounds stupid this is a champion that the master player and I have had surprisingly good success with his poke and utility is just so high compared to most ranged tops it's a high pressure style that just pokes and pokes then gets old and sniped the enemy top under Tower even having traps for more safety you're so hard to ever touch but now s tier the top five of meta picks right now honorable mention to high Medina's support a pick we found over a year before the pros did again he's still very good at support even after the Nerfs he has free LP but I didn't want him to take up a slot in the top five as the others a completely new off meta picks that I love one pick I'm actually going to put at number six is Ash top again this sounds stupid and I don't recommend it for all players to try out but I can't believe how good this pick actually is a player even hit Challenger with it the reason it works so well is is actually slowing Auto attacks every time she hits someone she sees them no one can ever get in range of her also having her e to scout the enemy jungle all to set up ganks and ghosts to kite she is oppressive and weirdly strong but onto the pics I actually recommend number five action support in a meta filled with ad support Champions akshan can match their damage beat their Mobility have permanent invisibility for rooms and even has a revive for his teammates to change the outcome of games this will be picked in Pro play I'd almost guarantee it and hopefully they can show how strong this revive passive is number 4. AP sejuan Emir a pic with surprisingly High poke damage in Lane easily procking electrocute using her W enemies never expect your early poke damage on this champion and they can even die when sejuani dashes onto them at level 3 but then at level 6 she gets her main kill tool a long range high damage ult see seeing them and following up with a dash and burst damage it's a snowballing pick that easily kills one person Every Time Herald is up all of this thanks to her little known High EP skeelings number three AP Zac mird this is a pick that caps gets most of the credit for but it was actually played in US Challenger before him last year with a full AP build SEC is one of the best mid laners junglers and even top laners right now and when you see Zach mid's damage you can see why with this huge amount of CC and burst it's really hard to ever shut him down number 2. 80 Carrie Mundo hear me out if you're a meta Marksman with a meta support then Mundo comes into your lane with a Soraka Asuna or any other enchanter or even a tank support to be honest suddenly your damage becomes useless you can't poke them you can't fight you're just tickling the enemy Mundo and then he gets level 6. he exhausts you and Sprints at you with an anti-cc Shield you stood no chance dying to his high damage Cleavers and Mundo is now winning Lane this pick is really brutal for any Edie carry to play against and with a good support like Soraka it becomes overpowered S Plus tier the best of me to pick right now I've seen safe one special pick for its own tier a pick that was recently hugely buffed which was sort of by accident it is crit Olaf top we found this from a challenger player named rank one Olaf not just the king of both meta but also the king of pentakills in every ELO from Iron to Challenger this pick works and now with a new build of infinity edge second it's even better where I changed this item to only require 40 crit to work in an attempt to make ad carry stronger but of course this only made Olaf able to kill them even faster Olaf's Unstoppable alt is now infinite getting longer with each Auto attack on an enemy Champion so he can quite literally Sprint through an enemy team with no way to CC him and enough healing in the build to stop him from ever dying this pick is already so good in solo queue as Olaf himself is already an OP top laner who wins 1v1 so you get an easy Lane buy some crit items and then take advantage of disorganized solo Q players to win fights by yourself this strategy is truly mind-blowing to watch and completely game breaking even before it was buffed so thank you to write it for buffing it again if you want a full guide on any of these picks there's a video for each one of them on my channel including how to play them like a master Grand Master or Challenger player and if you want to try them why not also join a repeat.gg tournament for free and win some cash prizes while you do it link to join is in the description completely free and no downloads required thanks so much for watching ","92":"this may come as a shock to you but even though nearly all of my content is based on the league of legends universe and character designs not the game itself i do in fact enjoy playing league of legends a lot actually this is real grass and i'm gonna walk on it but i ain't no coward ranked player instead i enjoy playing league with friends learning new champions and achievement hunting and while the new mission system is all well and good there's one specific area that caught my eye the guru section obtaining mastery on every champion and as a certified flex player with mastery on many a champion already i've set myself a goal get mastery 5 on every single champion but getting mastery 5 that's way too easy so instead i'm going to get mastery 5 on every single champion off meta of course it's not entirely up to me you guys get some input in the matter so you voted for today's episode to be about rob top that's okay i didn't want my brain cells anyway all right so i feel like we're going halo blades uh so this is gonna be good i think we'll do this we'll do some of these and then i think we get some of these here tanky stats actually get overgrowth and maybe could be conditioning so we'll be a tanky boy but we'll hit him like a truck is this optimal no probably absolutely not at all

the end of it yes yes we did it we did it [Music] bye ","93":"hey guys welcome back so before we get started if i sound a little different i'm trying out a new microphone if it sounds good let me know if it doesn't i can go back to the old one but anyways for today's topic i'm not going to be discussing any particular champion or group nor will it be based on a mechanic or game element instead i want to make a video discussing the league community particularly its mindset towards players who deviate away from what is considered conventional in league of legends there is a strong sense of conformity players are expected to take x champions to y roll and build z items ever since the game reached mainstream consciousness which i believe was around the start of season 3 everyone colloquially agreed to follow a bunch of unspoken rules which ultimately created what we now know as the meta most of the time any attempts to go against the tide would be quickly discarded as just another idiot thinking they discovered the next opie clickbait for professor kali to move like no tomorrow but every now and then an individual would be both ambitious and psychotic enough to diverge from the status quo and actually find success climbing high enough to compete with the best of the best in their respective regions whenever this does happen the responses come in a mixed bag some people might argue these cases are proof that you can play basically whoever you want however you want and still reach the likes of masters grandmasters or even challenger on the flip side there is an equal number of responses moaning and groaning about how everyone should avoid ranked for the next few days because everyone is going to start following this player and hardening games the number might be small relative to the entire community size but these moments occur very frequently so much so that my good friend happy chime noises has a channel dedicated to covering off meta players who are able to perform such feats so i thought i'd spend some time talking about off meta strategies are they creative and possibly beneficial for the game or is playing off meta talent mounted trolling and should be considered a punishable offense let's get started just like every other discussion topic we need to set the stage first what is meta the metagame is an approach to a game that transcends or operates outside of the prescribed rules of the game hence why at the beginning i said unspoken rules nothing in league of legends ordains what champions should be played in what role or which champions are the best right now we as the player base sort of collectively decide on how things should be done it creates a sense of structure and order within the game itself basically meta game literally translates to the game within the game it's also a background name for the most efficient or most effective tactic available which explains itself the meta shifts all the time in league of legends thanks to the bi-weekly patches we get with the slew of balance changes buffing and nerfing champions and items as well as introducing new ones however the easiest way to determine if something is meta is by looking at statistics do they have a high win rate pick rate and ban rate these three metrics may not always be conducive to a meta champion but they serve as an adequate indicator for example at the time of making this video camille has over a 51 win rate in top lane with about a 15 pick rate and ban rate typically a champion's win rate is inversely proportional to its pick rate since the more frequently a champion is played the more chances they have of losing games as they do winning so when you see someone with an abnormally high win rate along with the substantial pick rate and ban rate it's safe to say they're considered a meta pick the champions themselves don't make up the meta though so do the way they're played and how they're built right now karthus finds lasting employment in the jungle and bot lane whereas a long time ago he spent most of his time mid dr mundo used to be exclusively a top laner but ryde has been making attempts to push him into the jungle as for builds ezreal probably had more meta builds over the years than just about anyone else from runeglave to double tier to blue build to dustblade and now divine sunder and that's barely a fraction of how much has changed for him despite being pretty much the same as he's always been since he came out depending on how they evolve and how the game evolves with them their roles and builds can change so then if the meta is constantly changing what is off meta off meta is fundamentally a strategy that is utilized very infrequently one that deviates from the standard usage of that strategy there's a pretty wide range when it comes to this you can make a case for ap twitch or lucian mid being off metapix as they're not something you see most of the time even though everyone is aware of their viability what most people think of as of meta would be if a champion is going a completely different role and build which is the stuff chimes covers you got wukong support tank kha'zix mid crit aatrox jungle kiana 80k things like that admittedly off metapix can be pretty fun to watch one of my favorite youtubers is the boss i can't i can't pronounce your name but it's fine we're showing this guy is known for his super crazy science shenanigans and if you watch any of his videos you'll be smiling the entire time but i'm learning about money if you ran into any of these soft meta picks and chance select you're not going to be very happy but doesn't that make you wonder why is that why does seeing off metapix feel like such a terrible thing in league of legends why is it that when we see jannatop or sejuani mid that's considered a bad thing while not an unreasonable or irrational response towards those kinds of picks it does raise some serious questions as to why the community myself included is so averse to seeing off metapix and the notion that whoever goes these types of picks or trolls or enters when assuming we give them the benefit of the doubt they very well may be onto something after all there were quite a few instances where off meta picks eventually became the meta anyone remember ezreal jungle or pantheon support those started off as off meta picks until people quickly caught on to how broken they were i suppose the way we can go about this is to discuss the pros and cons of off meta picks i came up with a list myself and cross-reference it with chimes to figure out whether the good outweighs the bad we're gonna start first with the pros and cover the cons second arguably the best part of off metapix is that no one knows how to play against you even though metapix are very strong like diana jungle or ziggsbot after playing against them for like a dozen games you eventually figure out ways to play around them how to approach them in the neutral how to handle them in team fights and where their strengths and weaknesses are at first it may seem like a matchup nightmare but eventually all that experience can be utilized could you say the same thing if you were suddenly pitted against a heimerdinger support or a nasa's mid it's likely that's the first time you've ever played that matchup before which can work in the off metal player's favor as there's no prior empirical data to work off of even if you know what the champion's abilities do you still don't know all the interactions numbers and power spikes relative to what you play and especially what time you might have an idea on how to stop lillian jungle as zed mid but that's after you're both out of the laning phase and have a few items what happens if you go up against a lilia in the mid lane do you know if you can beat a pre-six without your mythic you're not sure right there's a huge element of surprise for off meta picks which can be used to your advantage to cheese a lot of wins this is especially true in solo queue where players have far too little respect for their opponent and often overestimate their own abilities much of the reason why these off meta players reach such high elo is because they capitalized on the fact that no one has ever fought against the kiana adc or athelios top it's a whole new ball game and these players tend to have complete mastery over their own champions like minimum half a thousand games their opponent on the other hand might be playing first time viego just because he's a meta champion thing is even for players who understand their lack of experience in this situation that in a way can also work to an awful metaplayer's advantage if you're up against an unfamiliar lane opponent with a radically different build than they usually do you might play a bit safer because you don't want to take unnecessary risks and accidentally get them fed but perhaps they're actually really weak in the early games so you should be aggressive meaning you fell for their mind game and ended up losing the one chance you had of shutting them down in a strategy game like league of legends knowledge is half the battle with no knowledge you start off at a massive disadvantage next reason is that some off metapix may actually be the solution to countering meta and not just a quirky tactic the player decides to pick up one of the reasons pike mid became such a problem is because a lot of champions in the mid lane have no mobility since they're home to the majority of mages well known for the lack of escapes also since it's a solo lane they have no support to peel for them making them an easy target for pyke since he's got enough damage and pressure to beat them head on and let's of course not forget his amazing roaming potential thanks to a stealth and fast tempo another example would be warwick top which we started seeing pop up occasionally ever since season 10. this guy does a fantastic job shutting down skirmishers and divers since he can sustain super well has a lot of stick potential and ridiculous damage at the moment camille and wukong are both really difficult top laners to deal with since they have a strong laning phase and scale really well but warwick destroys both of them with relative ease in each of chimes videos he explains the thought process and methodology behind off-meta picks in his tarik top video he explained how most melee champions in the early game even lane bullies like renekton and darius don't have the damage to out duel him because he can spam q heal over and over again which also gives him fast attack speed and on hit damage these off meta strategies may seem like random troll picks someone got from ultimate bravery but they're all intentional because they're usually good at countering whatever is meta almost as if there were anti-carries so those were the two key reasons i could think of why off metapix can actually be practical in some cases now let's take a look at the reasons as to why it's a bad thing while it may sound deviously satisfying that no one on the enemy team has any idea of how to play against you there's very much the possibility or frankly certainty that no one on your own team has any idea of how to play around you as well the words burn my tongue every time i say this but league of legends is a team game and requires the collective efforts of all five players to achieve victory off meta picks and or builds subvert expectations and understanding of that champion's capabilities which can inadvertently lead to situations where fights would have been won if either a normal or meta champion was played in that role or if the champion went the standard build such as tank kha'zix instead of going regular assassin you yourself as the off meta player may be aware of the potential impact you can have on a game your power spikes or what you're supposed to do in fights but with no way to quickly and clearly communicate that to your team it doesn't even matter which is all the more reason why i still can't believe voice cons haven't been implemented in league it's much easier to verbally explain to your team why ap sejuani mid has the best gang setup in existence because if you had to do it through text you have to stand still to type and also no one really reads chat anyway so in a way you take a huge risk every time you go off meta because you have to essentially hope that the enemy team is more unprepared for dealing with you than your own team is unprepared for playing with you the second issue is that due to the hyper specific nature of off meta strategies they can potentially have strict win conditions and game plans in order to match those meta champions if you recall my specialist video i talked about how the reason several of them have really low pick rates is due to having unique mechanics and gameplay which can only work in the most ideal circumstances off meta takes this even further obviously teemo jungle has terrible clear speed and pretty lackluster ganks so he has to conduct himself in a very specific way in order to stay relevant in the early game a felio's top is basically a worse version of any other range top because he has no escapes inconsistent pressure due to his different weapons and below average dps he does have severum and gravitum for sustain and roots but he won't always have them available more often than not he's gonna have to surrender lane priority against the majority of divers and slayers up top as they can gap close and burst them down quickly since he has no support remember things are meta because they are effective in as many circumstances as humanly possible being off meta inherently means you aren't efficient in a lot of situations xinjiang was meta for the past couple months because he had good sustain strong skirmishing decent ganks and surprisingly high durability making him useful in many situations on the other hand teemo jungle is not going to check out the same as the same it's kind of a paradoxical thing that off meta is seen as creative yet their champions can't really wear a whole bunch of hats so normally i would have a bias towards one point or the other for the healing video i sided against it for solo key vs pro play i was in favor of solo queue for the one tricks video i was supportive of one tricking up to a certain point but for the off meta i really don't know me personally i'm one of those players who only finds league fun when i win which naturally makes me inclined to say follow the meta since meta has the highest chance of winning or so we think but i can't in good conscience say that off meta is a bad thing either because again we have examples of them actually working yes i understand these are one in a million and if the average player tried these strategies themselves they'd play worse than my cat if i had one but that doesn't mean it's not possible and there have been quite a few games i've played where zillion 80 carry turbo diff the game or zed jungle were sleeper op and solo carry i think it's a case of the proverb a weapon is only as good as this wielder and it sort of ties in with the message i conveyed in the one tricks video where it's better to play a champion you know like the back of your hand than to first time irelia just because she's op right now of course it's a case-by-case basis just because soraka mid worked that one time doesn't mean it works every time it might have just been a lucky game one thing i do think needs to be addressed is riots somewhat unwillingness to accept off meta themselves every time we see enough meta strategy become popular it gets nerfed into the ground that in and of itself is a point of contention too if a champion is good enough to be effective in multiple roles that could be too powerful of a pick in pro play because for instance you can flex top jungle or mid lease sin or top mid support lulu that's a little overpowered not gonna lie and even if they were willing to allow these champions to have working off meta strategies there is a massive social stigma due to those strategies failing more than they succeed anyways i think that's about it for today if you enjoyed the video it would be awesome if you can leave a like consider subbing to the channel

watching and i'll see you again soon for the next video take care [Music] you ","94":"lots of meta shifting implications from 13.4 as vegar is back as a powerful carry for Mid and Bot Samira and maokai have finally fallen out of meta and is crit Diego now the most optimal way to play him we've got this and so much more to cover in today's video as we break down the updated tier list thanks to the help of our Challenger players and analyzing the most recent data but before we get into it be sure to check out skill cap if you want to truly get better at League of Legends we're the only service that offers a money back guarantee if you don't climb at least five divisions while actively using our service we do this because our service really does work and if it doesn't work for you you shouldn't pay learn more at the end of this video or click the link in the description below the most notable Trend up in the Top Lane for 13.4 is the rise of stronger laning Champs Quinn Olaf auction Pantheon Cassiopeia and Rengar are all performing extremely well as they have an easier time poking out melee Champions due to the Doran Shield Nerfs Olaf has been a relatively sleeper top laner in recent patches but he's finally getting a lot more attention in 13.4 ravenous Hydra is just such a broken item for Olaf because combined with his Q you've got near instant wave clear this allows Olaf to shove out waves extremely fast be a massive threat in the side lane and since you run ghost on Olaf top it's so easy to chase enemies down for easy kills when you have a lead as a result of the positive indirect changes from 13.4 we will be moving Olaf up one tier going from s into op looking for a hard counter to many of the meta melee top laners malphite is your guy W Buffs this patch have been massive as a w Max skill loader has seen a four percent win rate Spike into top laners who deal majority physical damage W Max is so broken right now as you not only gain bonus armor for putting more points into the spell but your consistent dueling power is way better as well with qmax malphite you can't really take extended trades and instead just look to whittle your opponent down over time but with wmax you can go toe-to-toe in the 1v1 and your opponent will not expect the damage at all all in all Mal is back in a really powerful spot and one of the best counterpick top laners of 13.4 for the complete Top Lane tier list we have Olaf Darius Shen and Gangplank locking down op tier spots another new Top Lane Trend that's been seeing more play patch after patch on many tank picks is the priority of Sunfire Aegis as a rush item instead of a tank Mythic you just delay your Mythic item until second and by rushing Sunfire you have a little more early wave clear which is something that many tanks lack orange Scion and Poppy are the three tanks performing best of the Sunfire Rush optimal low ELO Top Lane carries include York Garen and nasus Fiora Darius and Gangplank are three of the best Top Lane bands it pleases us to report that maokai's time on top of the Jungle meta has finally come to a close AP Mao has been destroyed by the Nerfs and if you're still wanting to play The Champ tank is definitely the way to go leandries is no longer an optimal way to play maokai as radiant virtue is the much better Mythic item in 13.4 the build to run if you still want to play maokai consists of demonic into gradient virtue and Sunfire Aegis the champ honestly isn't terrible if you're running the setup but I think we would all much rather go up against tank Mao than the sapling spamming AP Mal previously an op jungler the past few patches maokai is now good a-tier pick in 13.4 not over the top but still worth playing if you're going tank as mentioned during the intro crid Diego has a lot more viability in 13.4 but is it the most optimal way to play him it really depends on the game to be honest crit builds have heavily shot up in win rate and are performing at about the same clip as the Bruiser builds if you're playing against a very squishy enemy comp that you can burst easily going crit is amazing into more tankier comps that have a lot of CC Bruiser is still the way to go the most popular and arguably the best full crit build you can run consists of Shield boat into Essence Reaper and infinity edge Kraken is an option too instead of Shield boat but it does leave you much more vulnerable shieldbow is generally the best Mythic when going for crit because it at least provides a little more durability for when you're diving into fights looking for resets despite the Buffs to crit builds viego's overall power level has not shot up a whole lot this patch as his win rate has only moved about one percent we will be giving Diego the bump from B into a tier but by no means is he a priority s to your jungler after the changes moving on to the Jungle tier list we have fiddle Evelyn jarvin in Udyr as the most optimal carries as mentioned in our pre-patch tier list we were expecting Udyr to be hit the least out of all demonic junglers being nerfed and that has played out so far Udyr really hasn't lost much power at all as a result of his Nerfs so we have shifted him back into op for mid-patch same thing in regards to the amumu Nerfs as they were simply not enough to considerably shift his power level and he remains a great s to your jungler as a result maokai was really the only demonic user hit substantially in 13.4 even though Jarvan was nerfed this patch as well he continues to perform at a very impressive rate while holding one of the highest play rates for any jungler so he has been moved into op three the strongest low ELO junglers of the patch are fiddle mordekaiser and rammus Evelyn Udyr and Jarvan are who we have highest on the ban list range Buffs to vegar's q and W has seen his win rate Spike about three percent this patch which is pretty substantial added range on Q is actually huge in so many aspects as it helps vegar far more safely in lane and alleviates his main weakness of being a shorter ranged Mage making him less vulnerable in team fights when you're not playing into a comp with heavy dive threat definitely try running Rod of Ages on vegar Rod Rush is winning a little more than ever for us and is especially good for the lower ranks where games last longer and the early game is not as important rotted to Archangel second and ramadan's third is the core build to try a tier is where vegar will be placed on the tier list Faker just recently pulled out some gragas mid in the Pro scene but is it viable for solo queue as well it most definitely is and has been for a while but it's never gained the popularity that it deserves especially right now with Rod of Ages and Archangels being a very potent two item core gragas mid Works amazing you have a nice mix of durability and damage from the items which is perfect for gragas as a champion who needs to be diving into fights to be effective you can also go full glass cannon with ludens and Shadow flame but Rod of Ages is going to be more consistent for the majority of games gragas mid plays quite well into the majority of melee mid laners like Katarina Silas yone irelia and Zed Faker played his gragas mid into Silas as gragas does a really good job at nullifying a lot of silas's dive power due to the strong peel from gragas's e and r if you're looking for something new to play in mid Landing gragas is definitely a good option being placed in the S tier for 13.4 mid lane optier sees a bit of a shake up for Mid patch as we now have Annie aurelian Seoul Cassiopeia and Tristana as the best Mitt Ryan ended up throwing in some last minute Annie Nerfs that we were not expecting so her power level has fallen off a bit as a result last patch Annie was the clear-cut number one mid but now after the Nerf she's on the same level as Champs like asol Cass and tryst which is why we have moved those three into op cho'gath is a really interesting off meta mid lane pick as a result of his recent Buffs q and W had their power bolstered for 13.4 and much like the gragas mid Joe does really well into melee picks like Silas Zed yone and akali the Silence from show W can be an absolute nightmare for melee dive Champs to deal with and since you build show AP instead of tank his point-and-click R damage makes it very difficult for melee mids to survive in fights Joe mid will be placed in the a tier for 13.4 top three low ELO mids of the patch are Swain malzar Nanny Annie cassin and aurelian soul are the highest value mid lane ADC was the role least impacted by changes for 13.4 as the Samira Nerfs were the only notable ones Not only was Samira directly nerfed but the treasure hunter Nerfs also negatively affect her Samira has seen a pretty sharp decline in power as a result and is being moved back even further down the tier list into beats here for 13.4 for the ADC tier list Zaya Remains the highest priority carry of the patch magar is a really strong bot Lane option now due to his recent Buffs we'd even argue that botland vegar is in a better spot than mid lane vegar as he will be placed in the S tier if Helios Buffs have played out exactly as we expected and have not moved the needle enough to Warrant a push up the tier list Senna is actually back in a viable spot now for ADC so if you like playing the champ in the past but had dropped her due to her underwhelming power level now is a good time to consider picking her back up Santa's by no means a top-tier pick but a respectable a-tier ADC now top three low ELO bot Lane carries for the patch are Tristana Misfortune and vegar Draven ziya and twitch are who we've got highest on the ban list thresh is back in a big way for 13.4 as his Buffs have been highly impactful can you take away for thresh this past is that a q Max first is now the best way to play them regardless of the situation W Max used to be viable and arguably even stronger than qmax but after the 13.4 changes that's no longer the case Q Max first into W second and E last is the skill order performing the best another Trend we expected to emerge as a result of the Buffs include shiralia's holding higher priority over locket thresh q and EAP ratios were increased and as a result we have seen about a two percent win rate Spike for thresh players that build shiralias all in all thresh is back in business for 13.4 and we will be giving him the bump from s into op for mid-patch one Champion buffer 13.4 that has exceeded our expectations thus far is Senna Senna has seen over a two percent win rate jump as a result of her Buffs and is looking like a really strong option once again with so many of the range Sports falling in power due to the starting item Nerfs Senna has been one of the few who's actually increased in power for 13.4 when it comes down to range support Senna is now the most optimal for 13.4 and will be making a move into the Ops here support tier list is looking a little bit different from mid-patch as we have Senna and thrash moving into op joining Annie and rakan melee supports are without questioning the most optimal for solo queue right now exceptions being Senna and Annie thresh Glitz Nautilus and Recon are all incredibly strong especially now that many range supports have fallen in power speaking of range supports the Mana regen Nerfs have resulted in a decent decline in power for many enchanters and we've made a couple of adjustments on the tier list to reflect that maokai's support is also pretty weak now due to his Nerfs so after being one of the most consistently strong melee supports for a while his time on top of the meta has come to a close optimal low ELO supports to climb the fastest our brand Heimerdinger and Zyra Recon thresh and Annie are three of the best support bands alright guys before we wrap this up let's tell you a little more about skill cap so we offer a five division rank up guarantee and think that's a pretty crazy thing to offer it's like a gym membership guaranteeing you'll get ripped your local gym would go bust if they offered that right not us we've

luck in solo queue and we'll see you back soon ","95":"tank junglers are on the rise for 12.23 zerry is finally back in a playable State while the kassadin mini rework is looking extremely powerful we've got all this and so much more to breakdown as we are said to bring you guys a complete update on the solo Q tier list thanks to the help of our Challenger players and analyzing the most recent data and if you didn't know season is arguably the best time to get way better at League of Legends the reason is because when you focus on improving your own skills instead of just doing whatever it takes to scrape a win you do tend to lose a little more in the short term in exchange for huge gains in the long term so if you're thinking of mastering your macro skills and not joining every team

dragonflight valoran and Wrath of the Lich King so check us out right after this link in the description below and with that said let's move on to today's guide right slip some last minute casante Buffs into 12.23 that we were not aware of for our pre-patch tier list so let's have a look base stats were buffed with kasanti's health growth and base health regen increased e-change was the big one though as kasanti's e will now partially reset Auto attacks in his base form and fully reset his Auto attacks while in his all-out form a second change to e was added being a quality of life adjustment where if kasanti is very close to dashing through a wall he will now go through you also have to take into account that Sunfire Aegis was buffed this patch so casanti has become stronger in many different ways being able to abuse the two-item core of jock show into Sunfire casanti is sitting in a really good spot for 12.23 cassandy will be making his first ever appearance in the OB tier as a result of these recent Buffs another tank top laner making a move into op tier for our mid-patch update is Dr Mundo Mundo had every single one of his abilities adjusted for 12.23 one of the bigger Buffs consisted of Mundo's e damage being changed from a flat base scaling to now scaling off of his maximum health this is incredible considering Mundo is such a great heart steel user ultimate is now healing more and especially a rank 3 which makes Mundo a late game guy when it comes down to a low ELO Top Lane carry there are few who beat Mundo as a result of his Buffs from Iron to plot Mundo is insane but he does fall off a little once you get into diamonds and above as games don't tend to last as long since we try to cater our tier list to what's best for diamond and Below we will be giving Mundo op tier status for 12.23 so for the complete Top Lane tier list we have kasanti Fiora Mundo and Shen as the four op carries we are adjusting Fiora back into op tier for Mid patch as the ravenous Hydra Nerfs have been super light and with more tanks being played in The Top Lane and jungle it's honestly a buff to Fiora as expected most of the Top Lane tank Buffs were Placebo more than anything as Tom kench shogath malphite and Scion have not become significantly stronger due to their Buffs Mundo was the one exception of course as his Buffs were extremely impactful best low ELO Top Lane Champs of the patch armundo mordekaiser and nasus three of the highest priority bands are Fiora casanti and Darius tank junglers were having a more difficult time keeping up with clearing the jungle so Ryan made it so that your companions attacks scale off of health and armor and it's been a huge win ramus has been one jungler loving the Buffs and a skyrocketed in power for 12.23 since jungle treat gold was reduced as well these lower econ CC tank junglers have all become increasingly stronger if you haven't played any rammus in pre-season the new build consists of a thornmail rush into Chuck show second since chem tank and Sunfire are no longer Mythic items it's made thornmail the most optimal Rush option as an especially good jungler for the lower ranks rammus will be making the move into op's ear for mid-patch another tank jungler shifting up the tier list for mid-patch is Zach Zach was directly buffed benefits from the jungle companion changes along with the Sunfire Buffs so there have been many factors leading to Zack's rise Champs that can abuse the item combo of jock show and demonic Embrace are really strong right now and Zach is one of them before all these changes Zach was one of the worst solo queue junglers but that has all changed for 12.23 as we will now be moving Zach into the jungle s tier a new jungler who shot up out of nowhere over the past two patches has been Silas with the new Jungle being easier to clear it's allowed for Silas to make his way back into a viable spot the build is is really interesting right now as it consists of a night Harvester rush into Shadow flame second and zanya's third runes are different from mid lane Silas as well running dark Harvest instead of conqueror Silas will be placed in our jungle a tier moving on to the Jungle tier list the op tier will consist of ramus Udyr Master Yi e Evelyn and Echo with tree gold reduce this patch we are noticing a trend where junglers who rely heavily on item Spikes have seen a decrease in power kha'zix Rengar Talon and graves are a few notables who have all seen a dip and win rate for 12.23 if you're playing one of these A.D junglers and the enemy locks a tank who can build jock show you better end up winning early game hard or that jock show tank will heavily outscale you two items onward speaking of Tanks a few more moving up for mid-patch are amumu and Mundo the amumu Buffs have been insanely impactful and his stat lines would be even more crazy if players were maxing his abilities correctly since W and E were buffed at the later ranks you want to be leaving Q to max out last mordekaiser Nerfs have landed him where we expected as he's still a really good s-tier jungler vesla ELO junglers to climb the fastest are ramus Mundo and mordekaiser Master Yi Udyr and rammus are the top three jungle bands of the patch possibly the biggest winner of the entire patch has been casted in thanks to the mini rework of his e Cassie is no longer gated by ability usage and now has a flat cooldown which amplifies his One-Shot power tremendously before this buff if you were to clear a wave and then sit in the fog of War to wait for the enemy your e would not be available to use now that e has a flat cooldown you can just wait that out and always have e to provide more upfront burst your side lane power has become even greater with kassadin which is where he can Thrive when ahead cast-based Shield going up on Q in exchange for a lower AP ratio is massive as well early game is the only point where Cass can be heavily exploited so more durability to sustain his weakest point is paying huge dividends in our pre-batched year list we were unsure how impactful the e-change would end up as it's quite an unusual one but after seeing him on live servers and diving into the analytics kassadin makes his way into our mid lane op tier one mid laner rising in popularity over the recent patches and for good reason has been irelia irelia has one champ who can abuse all of the most broken items in the game right now being blade of the ruined King ravenous Hydra and jock show this core is super nuts and it's propelled Aurelia into an extremely powerful spot irelia also does insanely well into syndra Victor and kassadin who are all picked a ton in the current meta deservedly so irelia will be moving from a and into s tier for 12.23 for the mid lane tier list we have just two champions in the op tier being Zed and kassadin Cass and Zed are simply on a level above everyone else right now so it pushes Vex down into s tier Vex also struggles quite a bit into both Cass and Zed so it makes sense that she is not in the same tier as them syndra nerves have actually played out a little more harsh than anticipated as the changes have shaved about four percent off her win rate we had originally adjusted syndra into s for our pre-patch tier list but we'll be shifting her down even further and into a for mid-patch Trend is a really insane ravenous Hydro abuser and can stop all over a lot of the squishy Midland Champs when he gets ahead at level 6 with ultimate available it's way easier to perma-dive mid-champs than it is most top Lane Champs with E and Raven this you can shove waves super fast and roam around with ghosts to heavily impact the map Cass coming back into meta is another great reason to have Trend available as a pocket pick and he'll be placed an S tier for mint patch the most optimal low ELO mid lane Champs are Swain malzahar and Heimerdinger Zed kassadin and irelia are now three of the highest priority mid lane bands zerry is back to being a relatively strong carry for 12-123 as the Buffs have lifted her from the grave zerry is a slightly more vulnerable Champion now with her Q range being lowered but the reward for being up close has been increased with damage going up this shift in power has been super positive and has led to about a seven percent win rate Spike now if the average Champion were to see a win rate jump of seven percent it would probably land them in an OP spot but since zerry was so terrible before the Buffs she's now in a good spot but nothing over the top is it worthwhile to pick Zary back up again our analysts definitely think so and she will be placed in her a tier for mid-patch Zari was the only ADC change for 12.23 so the tier list is looking very similar to last patch the optier consists of twitch Tristana and case for an update on ravenous Hydra adcs the Nerfs have made it sub-optimal on most of them now Draven and Samira are better off skipping the item however the one exception is Nila Nila is still performing super well with Hydra as a rush as the two item core of ravenous and shield bow synergize extremely well with her kit now this area is no longer in a terrible spot the only adcs you really want to stay away from are felios and kalista they can work for the higher elos but for the majority of ranks there are much more optimal picks best low ELO adcs are Tristana Misfortune and ziggs top three bands of the patch include Draven kaisa and Samira the one champ we incorrectly predicted their Direction in power shift for 12.23 was a moomoo support q and E being nerfed the earlier ranks had us hypothesizing that it would hurt amumu's laning phase too much but the buff to his W and buff to e damage at Max rank outweighed the early game woes Riot even mentioned in the patch notes themselves that they were not trying to buff a moomoo support with these changes but he's seen about a three percent increase in win rate for this patch as a result of the positive outlook from the Buffs amumu will be moving back into the support opt here for Mid patch maokai was one of the other supports buffed for 12.23 and he's landed in a very powerful spot Cube Buffs amplifying maokai's all in power are a really big deal and has allowed him to solidify an OP tier spot once again moving on to the support tier list the optier will consist of a handful of Champions being amumu Heimerdinger blitzcrank maokai and Janna we've been on the fence about moving Heimer into op tier for the past few patches now and have finally decided to bump him up Heimer plays extremely well into hook supports like thresh blitzcrank and Nautilus due to his turrets and even in a lot of double ranged matchups he's able to go toe-to-toe the ability to permish shove waves and apply a ton of pressure is what makes Hymer so potent for solo queue very few supports have the ability to apply as much constant pressure as Heimer the Yumi Nerfs have been about as impactful as anticipated as she is definitely one of the weaker solo queue enchanters now hovering down in our b-tier a few of the best low ELO supports you should consider are brand Heimerdinger and Zyra John of blitzcrank and Heimerdinger are some of the most optimal support bands alright guys before we wrap this up let's tell you a little more about skill cap so we offer a five division rank guarantee and think that's a pretty crazy thing to offer it's like a gym membership guaranteeing you'll get ripped your local gym would go bust if they offered that right not us we've offered this for years because our service really does work it works so well in fact that we're able to produce by far the largest catalog of Premium League guides on the internet we add over 20 videos a week with over 1600 guides curated into over 100 courses no one can compare we've also sent Challenger players into ELO hell's 714 times and Counting where they commentate how to carry live they also respond to all questions asked sign up today for as little as 6.99 a month if you are serious about improving so that's gonna round everything out for our 12.23 mid patch tier list update thank you guys so much for watching good luck in solo queue and we'll see in the next one ","96":"oh yeah what's going on game leapers this is a long time no speak and in this video we're going to go through the 10 most broken champions for batch 1222 for in the preseason but just before we do get into the video one thing you guys have to do before you get into your next game is to download the poor Professor app Linked In the description because it allows you to quickly import the best room page used from the best players in the world on the champion you're picking you don't have to make the room page just one click of a bun and bang you're ready to go but that's not all because the app also allows you to scale your opponent and the app will give you their stats how well they play their Champion so you can know more about your opponent than they know about themselves and the app also gives you an in-game overlay so you can compare your CS in your kill participation to your rank or even Challenger players like Faker and there's a reason why 3 million people have downloaded this free application guys it's because it works so get around it in season 12 those links are in the description now starting off at number 10 we have Jax from the Top Lane and one of the big reasons Jax is just enjoying 1222 at the moment as well he didn't actually get Nerf and if you think about at the end of season 12 he was one of the strongest top leaders and whether that's because of lethal Tempo synergize this with your passive and you're one of the highest DPS Champs in the game but in the actual pre-season we do have an interesting addition for Jax this being Spiro shojit this item is unreal for Jax especially the passive but your core items are probably still going to be divine Sandra followed by Frozen heart now if you are really snowballing like I'm talking you're like 10-0 after your Divine sunris Spike then you can get a shojin after this you don't have to go Frozen Heart it really just depends on the game you're in so if you're against a lot of attack speed based Champions rosenheart has a lot of value if you're North though then you can actually just get a spirit Shogun as your second major item so that's one of the big reasons why Jax is still incredibly strong so definitely consider having him in your champion pool for the rest or the preseason and potentially season 13. now another champion you want to have in your champion pool this is Zed and of course we're talking about Zed in the mid lane and for Zed in the mid lane because of all the other changes right that I've mentioned in previous videos so if we think about The Scorch buff if we think about Zed starting with long short order maybe three health potions very few mid laners have that much sustain anymore especially after the sustainers in 1214 if we think about the energy buff to his shadow slash this going down by 10 a few patches ago this helps him out so much as well but there's also an interesting addition for Zed in the preseason a bit like the Jax build we talked about so shojin coming in we're talking about ravenous Hydra Z and we will talk about some of the wackiest bills guys in tomorrow's video so make sure you hit that subscribe button so you don't miss out on all that juicy information and yet ratherness hydron Zed if you want to get this as your first item or after your eclipse or parallel score or dustblade whatever lethality method you decide to go it's actually very deadly because of the new passive they put into this even though it did actually get Nerf so the cost was gonna buy 100 gold and the actual damage you get from the passive this is down a little bit but it's still incredibly good for Zed as well this also helps with your wave clear even though your wave clear is still good don't get me wrong without Hydra and the tier map passive the cleave passive but what I'm really getting at here is that you can actually save some of your abilities you can actually just Auto attack in E waves now you can save your Q so if you do get jumped on while you're clearing a wave you easily have enough power to kill that champion jumping on you and it just makes your shove and Rome assassin play style even deadlier now moving on number eight on the countdown this is karthus in the jungle and the carthus to be an S Plus tier champion in master and above in career to all these Champions guys and these stats are actually taken from high yellow career where these players will get the most out of the Champions so it's kind of like a bigger representation of the actual meta rather than me going down to like all ranks and talking about Master Yi for example but yeah karthus is one of these champions in high reloads who is really enjoying life and I think one of the big reasons why is because of how easy it is now to clear the jungle especially because of the krugs change so because when the big Krug dies it just goes into the little krugs right there's not an extra two medium Crux so area of effect jungles like karthus with his late ways with his defile love this you clear krugs so so quickly and it accelerates your clear speed you have one of the fastest focus in the game I mean you kind of did before but now it's even better so karthus because of his insane clear speed because of the new Jungle changes he is number eight now moving on to number seven on the countdown just ahead of character so the same in the jungle here so if you don't want to play Magic damage Damian jungler then you have to pick Kindred now one of the reasons Kendra is so powerful at the moment especially in high reelers is because you actually just have more time if you think about it to mess with the Enemy jungler because the skull crab spawn has been pushed back to 3 minutes 30. there is a bigger opportunity for you to get in their face and kill them because lots of people now will think oh my goodness like crab isn't spawning until 3 30 they will just fall clear and full clearing don't get me wrong it's like good because you get level 4 and you get like a guaranteed 900 or so gold under your belt but it does mean that you can get hit at any cap buy a strong early game jungle like Kindred especially when you're running something like press the attack right which you can get in your face she can disrupt your clear and I understand that when you do invade and take enemy camps you're not getting as much from them these days but the point is Kendra just has more opportunity now probably because players like I said they're just in that pool clearing mindset so they don't expect that invade so Kindred in 12 22 if you want to try to win a game and snowball at 1v9 at out of control she is definitely one of the better jungle picks now number six on the countdown we're heading back to the Top Lane here so he talks about Jax earlier who actually does very well into this champion this being Darris and I don't really think we have to talk too much about Darius here because we all know how good he was right towards the end of season 12. not much has really changed for the preseason so far he's still an absolute beast in the Top Lane in terms of the DPS the Conqueror stacking the low W cooldown I've mentioned this so many times before and as far as the items go I mean not really much has changed for Darius you can see that in some games people are building turbo can tag because the passive the movement speed right means that it's really hard for you to get kited I mean the movement speed you're getting from dead man's even the stride breaker ride with the slow it really stops enemy champions from kiting you which again it's just your big weakness but because Dara still has all of his strengths even though sham Champions might have been improved a little bit so if we think about Jacks right if we think about other top laners who can make use of ravenous Hydra and we might even get into a couple of these very soon Darris is still very innately strong so he has to be mentioned here now coming in at number five on the countdown and guess what we are talking about guys one of these Champions who can abuse ravenous Hydra this is Camille and Camille before or the ravenous Hydra change you were building it now it's even better even after the nerfed this has made Camille arguably the best champion in the game and probably the best top player you can see these stats I'm in with this room page in 75 matches and high reload a 68 win rate and with this core setup of divine Sandra and then ravenous Hydra you can check any rank in the game so this isn't even just for high reloads I know it says here a 72.5 win rate this will easily be above probably like 55 across every single rank it is just outright broken and for Camille the cleave passive is so so valuable kind of like I mentioned for Zed because of the wave clear it gives you Camille's wave clear is honestly just horrifically bad until she gets Hydra so this really helps you out just remember guys if you are playing Camille try to play around your passive and remember that your hook shot without it you are very very killable so do be a little bit careful if the enemy jungler is missing or if you're against something like a Darius or Jax who can stop your hook shot be very careful about just using it now moving on to number four on the countdown guys the first of two A.D carries here now this one is Caitlyn and because Caitlyn was very strong towards the end of season 12 right because really what would talking about here is the buff to Caitlyn but kind of came in towards the end of season 12 to have passive damage to headshot damage this made her stronger and because the bot Lane at the moment well there aren't really that many strong ad carries and because Caitlyn you're one of the strongest lame bullies you could easily win Lane and just get out of it and snowball but to be honest Caitlyn is actually very difficult to play in lower elos and that's because people just don't understand how to play this champion at the highest level and also because well here's the Dilemma if you do die once on Caitlyn because the whole goal is just to like stomp playing right and then snowball across the map getting reptiles getting top Tower getting mid-tower eventually that's how you win a game so if you die once it just starts up your whole Rhythm Caitlyn is a champion who has to be ahead you're not picking her to scale because you'd pick something like a jinx or twitch or cold war you're happy to lose Lane so you have to know how to win Lane how to pressure minions how to harass the enemy Champions how to use your abilities together how to synergize harmonize them and we can teach you how to do just that on our website so once again make sure you check that out as far as this room page goes I know it's recommending cut down here which is kind of good but it's really recommended if you do style long sword and three hole potions so if you start with a D Blade Take coup de gras this will just be better now speaking of that other AD carry who's a little better statistically than Kaelin this is Samira and for the 80 carry position guys on bot Lane there aren't really like many changes to talk about right like when you look at this page for me so as far as the runes skill priority the items at the bottom the Summoner spells everything is really still the same so because Samira hasn't been nerfed you know in the preseason thus far she is still one of the summoner's Rev powerhouses because of those changes that came in earlier to season 12 that really Buffs your scaling so to your cues damage and your attack damage per level these mean that honestly if you do get going in the early game like if you get snowballing if you get a few kills during the laning phase you become the biggest champion on the rift and honestly I might even argue that you've become the best snowballing champion because of the scaling you now have on top of that so Samira especially if you're against like projectile or maybe skill short base 80 carries or even bot Lanes she is an unreal pick and a great Champion to have up your sleeve for the pre-season now coming in at number two this is a champion who is in the bot Lane but this is a support and this is blitzcrank and in high my relays you can see the blitzcrank I mean I know this is only from 14 matches but trust me when I say this he has over like a 52 53 win rate in Korean High ELO and lots of you are probably thinking but didn't Blitz get kind of like heavily nerfed in terms of his base HP right in terms of his base armor for sure he did his early game has become weaker in the sense that he is squishier but his damage from the rocket grab is still 100 if you guys remember that buff earlier in season 12 they buffed blitzcrank's Q damage so at level one so rank one one point at it does 100 damage this is huge like if you land this you are still burning flashes you are still probably killing enemy Champions also your ultimate the static field damage they also buffed in that same patch that is still there so the actual One-Shot potential blitzcrank has he is still as deadly as he has ever been even if they didn't know if the rocket grab damage from Rank 2 onwards so once you do actually level up your Q it deals less and less damage but it's still easily enough so blitzcrankers on this countdown for those reasons kind of interesting here as well how these Koreans are running revitalized to really help your passive because your passive Shield did actually get nerfed so this helps you out a little bit and just remember guys if you are into ranged bot Lanes please take glacial logman and hex Flash the slow is so useful because it means the enemy Champions can't cut you out and hex flash if you can burn their flashes early on the hex flash once you get onto them GG will play for the number one Champion guys for the preseason I honestly think she's just head and shoulders and we ain't talking the shampoo above everybody else sorry that was really bad but yeah this Champion is syndra so for syndra because of the changes towards the end of season 12 right so the new passive you've got in terms of your Splinter stacking empowering your basic abilities so your Q your W your E I think really the two big changes there are your Q you get two charges of it and of course your E's radius this ping 90 degrees I mean how is this even still 90 degrees I think this has to be nerfed I just think it's way too Noob friendly that might sound like a little toxic but again it just is right like it just makes it way too easy to land and there's just little counter play to it like if you're fighting in one of the rivers ride around dragon or Baron you're just going to get hit by syndra's e no matter what so your spacing has to be so clean and for people in lower ELO yeah it's just really really hard to navigate around but any anyway since you're here the room page you can see you can take area you can take first strike if you know you're into a shorter range Champion for a strike you're going to get so much gold and because you are really like more of a scaling Champion these days this is going to help you get to ludens saw shoe Shadow Flame the full magic penetration setup right and of course we still have that ultimate buff in the game where you execute Champions below 15 Max HP so Central guys is the number one Champion for 12 22 and at the moment for the preseason so I'd highly recommend playing it because I still think she'll be broken even if she does get enough just because of how good a kit is so those were the 10 most broken Champions yes for the preseason guys if you did enjoy the video please leave a like down below and for our future season 12 content we will be back to uploading daily videos make sure you hit that subscribe button and of course any questions any thoughts on the Champions and info we'll talk about leave them down below and until tomorrow's preseason upload on the 10 craziest builds this is ","97":"yo yo yo what's going on game weepers it's easy and in today's video we're going to be listing the changes that have been released for 13.4 now in tomorrow's video we will have all the details on what these changes are actually going to be yeah so make sure you hit that subscribe button so you don't miss tomorrow's video but in today's video we're just going to list exactly who is getting Nerf and I guess just like the systems that are on summoner's Rift so to find out all this information guys make sure you stick around for the whole video and if you do actually want to improve like 13.4 which is what we're talking about in this video it might help you out a little bit in terms of winning more games right because the meta suits your Champions more but honestly like you're still going to be hard stock bro like let's be honest does your win rate actually improve from pasture patch it doesn't it says exactly the same so who cares what these changes are legit these videos are giving you info but they're not giving you actual like hardcore info that will help you improve you know what will gameweep.com our website has 50 off at the moment for Valentine's Day and seeing as it is Valentine's Day and Happy Valentine's Day to all the Valentine's out there you know you guys should make use of that amazing offer we are uploading daily videos to our website I myself I'm uploading like condensed highlights from the coaching sessions I do so I pretty much give you guys challenge for advice and actual applicable things you can do in your game straight away that will instantly help you improve like I'm Legit you will legit claim to Visions just from watching a few of my videos anyway that's on the game lead website linked down below and yeah let's get into the 13.4 changes now as far as Champion bluffsco first up we are Vega Vega is getting buffed because well this Champion I've not seen him in ages and even if he is picked into like a close range composition he is just so weak at the moment I remember back in season 12 he was actually pretty good but at the moment he's just really weak and apparently the bus are as follows your W is getting bigger range and also your Q which is nice this should help your laning phase race you can get to the mid to late game so Vegas the first Champion next up we have cho'gath chogeth in the Top Lane yeah he might be okay but he's super punishable right and he's also very easy to play against if you have your model to turned on because your Q I mean if you get hit by a Cho gav Q you better be cc'd before it I tell you because dodging it is pretty easy and the champion getting Buffs I think this is definitely Justified now moving on to Alistair Alistair did get buffed in 13.3 but these didn't really do too much for I like AP ratios and you know maybe man of course like who cares like other supports like Nautilus his win rate has actually skyrocketed because his all in got more damage as Alistair you're really not feeling this so I'm guessing that's what the bus will be so Ali's getting buffed as well heading back to the mid lane with Arya who's getting buffed interesting to buff Ari because spell Bugari actually does very well in like every single ELO but I guess compared to like really strong control Mages whether it's something like maybe a singer or his ear and I'm talking really about like Pro play here and just the learning phase okay I can maybe say this so Ari's getting buffed as well but I don't think it should be too big now we also have malphite getting buffed and malphite in the Top Lane I mean you're really picking him into attack damage right if you pick him in the enemy Champions AP you're gonna have a hard time but malphite getting buffed his win rate yeah hasn't been too hot he's been like a B2 Champion the whole season I can see this now we also have Lil Kenny in other words Cannon getting buffed and yeah Canon's the same thing right like you're probably picking him to counter Champions like stuff like Fiora maybe right but on the whole the champion is just innately weak so again I just think this is actually a good buff and we'll have to wait and see what that is until tomorrow now viego is another champion getting buffed and I know viego you know is one of those junglers who well you probably don't enjoying against because when a Fed Diego is a Fed viego it's very annoying to go I guess but honestly compared to other junglers at the moment as well like Lee sin j4 who got bluffed and all the attack damage jungles even the AP junglers Diego has just fallen off pretty hard so the Rune King getting a buff yeah I think it's real now we also have a failure skinny buffed and affilios on our tier list anyway has been seated but like eternity I swear I don't think this Champion has ever been above seated and I understand the solo queue is different to Pro playwright or organized play for sure but Ophelia still does pretty well into some matchups but at the moment right we just haven't seen him at all in Pro play and in terms of solo queue he's just really underperforming compared to every other AD carry so affilios getting buffed thank you to the balance State now we also have Santa getting buff kind of the same thing right this Champion has been seeds here in artillos for the last couple of patches and that's because well in terms of the ball Lane at the moment right xender is just really going to struggle especially with engaged supports coming back because you do so badly against them Santa really likes playing against enchantresses but even against enchantresses like before this kind of Engagement came in Santa wasn't doing too well maybe beat him maybe 80 or best but that's about it so send it getting Buffs as well this is good now we also have Riven getting buffed and I love that like Riven goes two to three patches without being asked here and Riot buffer like she's got that many skins bro that's got to be the reason why but yeah this is just typical balance team right the river Mains are probably going nuts on Reddit as well or on Twitter at the riot desk so they're giving her a buff here then we have orianna who's getting some follow-up Buffs to remember the Buffs a couple of patches ago so do you so to your Hues like pass through damage your W's man of course and also your ultimate damage which everyone thought was actually going to be like a legit Shockwave new type thing well it hasn't really been the case sonori's win rate has well really just like not changed at all so getting some more Buffs this is good as well now moving down to Champion Earth we have Samira getting nerfed samira's win rate and in every single ELO pretty much is really high she's an S plus two Champion yes thank you Ryan for nerfing this really frustrating chair pit I can't say the words I want to say because I will get in trouble but yeah Samira getting nerfed thank the heavens above now Jax is also getting nerd thank the heavens above maokai is getting nerd thanks to Evans above here we go so Jackson maokai I mean in their roles right they're the number one champion is Jack's the Top Lane and that's been the case in our recent videos and the most broken Champions videos Jack's number one for Top Lane maokai number one for Jungle do we really think the Jacks would have been affected by any sort of like well I guess so maybe item changes they gave to the Top Lane for other Champions getting buffed like you can just ban Jason just insta log Jack you can blind pick him he's that broken at the moment because he really shouldn't be like a blind pickable Champion you should be picking this guy as a counter pick but he's so busted that you can just pick him regardless of who you go against so Jack's getting nerfed in that maokai yes even though demonic Embrace corner to maokai himself got nerfed if you're going radium virtue it's probably worse now but the champion still has a 54 win rate so well done Ryan for finally picking up on this and hopefully these Nerfs are actually going to be legit this time and we also have at least guys amumu and who they're getting enough all of these are kind of similar right well at least as well unique I guess and the change to the last patch where they buff like experience from Jungle camps and they also buff Tower damage in the early game like why does Tower damage even matter for at least like you're diving someone but you're not taking any Tower aggro anyway maybe there's some way they could like rework her e that would be like the only reason I'm not saying they should but that's like the only kind of solution remedy to that problem right so the actual changes in 13.3 to discourage elite players from doing this no one cares about it that's why she still has like a 53 win rate a moomoo exactly the same as Udi Ryder maokai with a demonic Embrace Rush a Mumu of conquer and even in 13.3 like illegitko buffed yes his e is dealing less damage early game but it's dealing more damage from level 9 or rank 5 onwards also with your Q the Mana cost going up no one cares bro about this you're getting blue buff on a moo moo so yeah who cares and then for Udi just like I mentioned right demonic Embrace Rush Phoenix stands still has incredible winner it's very very annoying jungler to play against so he's getting nerfed as well well done reader now another jungle getting Nerf this is j4 and because of the Buster I gave him so whether it's to your base armor whether it's to your whether it's to I shall W so it's a real ability now Ryder nerfing j4 just because he's doing a bit too good now honestly it's not like he's doing any type of good right so I'm kind of surprised they're nerfing him like just straight away here and it kind of just goes back to the Rhythm thing in a way Riven legit like doesn't even have a bad patch I could still find a player and she gets bust straight away j4 means I can't even play one patch with their W as an actual ability and he's already getting nerfed now maybe it's not going to be to his W but hopefully you catch my drift now moving back to the mid lane last two Champions guys getting nerfed one of them is a Nivea so Nivea is pretty much the ultimate Rod of Ages and Sarah's Embrace user at the moment what you do have rise in there as well but in solo queue I'm talking about you and if you're an actual some elos it's the only S Plus tier Champion based on win rate and actual play rate and all that stuff very difficult to beat unless you're actually playing like a really really hard counter tour maybe something like a Fizz or something like this but with these other Champions not really being that strong you don't get you can blind pick her you're gonna have a good time exactly like Jackson the Top Lane so nearly getting nerfed I can see this now the last champion is azir I just want to say I'm so sorry to all you pigeon Mains out there but your Champion is pretty much based off Pro play and it makes it so frustrating right because in solo queue this Champion I mean where I really have to do something to like the game in order to make these control Mages like orianna syndra Ari is here actually you know like playable and carriable it's not like you're playing Katarina where one kill or a serious lead really matters right as is here even if you have like 100 CS to the enemy mid lane is 50 CS doesn't really feel like it means anything and you're getting nerfed again and in solo queue this is just gonna mean well you might as well look for another champion to make it is just that bad for the emperor shariva now moving down to Champion adjustments thresh your skill Max order so whether you're going like q w a e I'm sure right I want you maxing your Q first so the adjustments that come in here I'm sure will be orientated around that as far as System bus go we have Relic Shield and still shoulder guards getting some Buffs so again engage support items they're moving down the system next both these Edge and spectral sickler Getting Nuts kind of interesting that the circle is getting nerd I mean maybe that's why they're buffing Center in response to this but yes these two items which are really used by range supports right and enchances this just again shifts The Meta towards those engaged close range melee support now we also have a kill experience that's getting nerfed we also have kill comeback experience that's getting nerfed so in terms of getting a lead it will be less profound and in terms of coming back from being hide this is going to be less profound as well what will this mean for the game well honestly we'll have to wait and see exactly what the nerves actually are here now treasure hunter is getting nerfed because this item well it just gives you so much gold and it's so snowbally way too snowbally especially even if you're like playing ad carries right like if you're playing Draven Samira or something like this if you're in the jungle and playing something like Gray's these Champions froth this Rune and it's just super abusable right now now we also have demonic Embrace in your clear speed so the actual yet damage I guess you're dealing to Camp so maokai movement who did these type of champers right that's another Nerf they have to deal with and then finally guys we have system adjustments so jungle sustain and clear speed is going to be adjusted then we also have Triumph grasp and D Shield which are getting adjusted as well again we will detail all of these in tomorrow's video and we'll have a bit of a discussion about what this might mean but guys those were the listed changes for 13.4 thank you so much for watching the video if you did enjoy it please leave a like down below and until tomorrow's video on these changes this is Phoenix foreign ","98":null,"99":"this list probably wouldn't be complete without at least paying a mention to funneling of course this is not to say that funneling was never meta because back in season eight at one point it was the most dominant strategy in competitive play with Master Yi Tarek and nunu and Karthus starting the original idea with things like Caixa funneling and Ziya recon funneling really shaping the meta now funneling has been around for a while and was not invented by tarik and Master Yi players for example rat IRL a popular twitch jungle streamer has been doing the support follow you around buff you up while you take all the jungle camps anna-lena farm strategy for a pretty long time because it's a great way to elope Oost however the strategy does not tend to be very popular anymore as it was nerfed several times due to its dominance in competitive play the thing is tarik is still technically the highest win rate mid laner in the game albeit a very low sample size the players who still do Master Yi tarik funneling can find great success as far as bot lane this is a type of bot Lane that can really only be described as the perma cc Lane there are plenty of good duo queue strategies that you can play with your laning partner double arcane comet poke with Ashe and Zyra double dark harvest mage with Karthus and brand but one of the better off meta bot lanes of all time has to be the double bruiser bot lane my all-time favorite being Renekton and leona there was a time a while ago that it was pretty meta to run a Renekton leona bot lane and i'm a cutie pie would end up getting smashed by it a few times on his stream obviously the big strength of the combo is for Renekton or leona to start the ngage typically with a Leona R or a Leona E and then Renekton can easily follow up and kill them it's pretty hard to gank the lane as well and after level 6 they may be able to 3v too since both of them are very tanky since Leona can take aftershock and Renekton gets help from his ultimate if you combo that with the fact that Leona has sustained through relic shield and Renekton has built-in sustain in his kit it makes him a solid bruiser for the Bottomley a decent modern-day equivalent take on this is to try out the you are never moving ever bot lane with Pike and Nautilus both of these champions are really good right now and both do decent damage even though they are supposed to be engaging supports these types of bot lanes have been around for a while and they almost have always been at least a little bit viable whenever playing versus a very weak bot Lane like jinx and Yumi you can really punish them with this type of Lane Fred LeBlanc the ad LeBlanc build has been around for a while and it's one of the only off meta builds that on paper really makes no sense what I mean is that things like a peacock ma ad UV thala D Sion ap NASA's maxing E these things work because the champion has abilities that actually scale with the build even if it's not optimal the literal reason that it can work is because it has some ability to scale with the items that you're building for LeBlanc though she has 0 ad scalings she has no kind of max health or percentage health scaling no scaling of any type except for raw ap seemingly she could only ever build ap then right well no not really because ad LeBlanc works almost entirely because of the way her kit plays out in game although she provides no damage whatsoever except for auto attacks this can be enough to carry LeBlanc's distortion is extremely powerful as a tool that an ADC might want think about if Ezra would arcane shift forward then always go back the fact that you have a free flash escape clone and a stealth mechanic for more survivability and a chain to peel yourself and stick on people when you're stronger than them helps you kite around people and make them look silly the build was quite popular a couple of seasons ago as voyboy was known for spamming it and there were genuinely challenger players trying out a deal along top lane and finding pretty good success the build will typically go for full crit and then combo that with trinity force for proc and xin when you double you forward and auto attack somebody you are a fantastic split pusher and a side laner due to your safety at taking towers and splitting since you can always get away and proc chignon towers the build still does work to this day so long as you build essence reaver statikk shiv in infinity-edge first three items and use press the attack as your keystone beforehand people were taking Fleetfoot work a lot but that rune has been nerfed so much on ranged champions that you're almost always better off just taking pta of all of the things on the list today this is easily my favorite and it even comes with a pretty good story the year is 2015 the European LCS is gaining more and more popularity as it has some very exciting talent and teams fnatic is the best team in the region with a bright young star duo with hooni and reignover they also have a brand new mid laner with FEHB even the boy who killed faker into the jungle not as fruitful that there's the Jeff bar coming in and will it be not the part [Applause] aggressive pick making team faker each to shuriken the knock-up is interrupted as better than materializes fnatic is seemingly an unstoppable team however there were some new kids on the block the unicorns of love are a new organization with members that at the time were completely unknown this was when power of evil was first onto the scene and before Hill sang was one of the best supports in the world these guys had a ragtag team of young talent and were totally ready to take on Europe throughout their run they whipped out some interesting picks that would shock the world such as Twisted Fate jungle against TSM a game in which they won and would eventually win the series this would also put power of evil on the map as he destroyed bjergsen confidence that Pantheon was not here to counter gank and you can see he goes double double use for his distort W distortion they're just against a first picked Pantheon huh oh man I'll Jam your power people cause barracks in a game yeah one more also attack all the queue we'll finish him off and power of evil that was a question that sharks are solely wrong they gave me my abusive taking a lot of damage more probably will get their cooldowns back twisted fate actually I might use these ultimate there as well and he's gone top lane to pick up a kill on Sedaris they also played Shaco they played oh dear the pre reworked poppy and power of evil literally invented middling lethality varus something that would become meta for years to come after he played it and during the spring split these two teams fnatic the European powerhouse of an organization and the unicorns the big question mark coming into the split would go head-to-head and what would end up being in my opinion the most exciting match in competitive play history 5 second cooldown at rank 5 this is crazy this patch man now we running an old-school jorik cassiopeia composition where you have this suicide mid laner who just goes bazookas on the enemy team and then you resurrect her once she dies I mean this is Yorick top lane now visit Chachi to understand the pic we have to understand how the all-new art worked before his rework York was not a very good champion being the main reason that he was even changed he had a really toxic kit that had basically zero presence in any play competitive or solo queue that being said there was a strategy that worked way back in the day as an old-school team composition York and Cassiopeia the old New York alt was called omen of death allowing York to reanimate a teammate or himself and even if they died they still had ten seconds to pop off if you couple this with a hyper carry which back in the day Cassiopeia was thought to be one of the best hyper carries in the game you would end up having an unstoppable beast of a teamfight this game would go down to the wire with several extremely close calls eventually power of evil did it all on Cassiopeia and one of the most miraculous finishes ever POA and visit chachi would take down fnatic with their York and Cassio to v8 combo the mini map that got the Barons still trying to push it it's just a lonely nuna trying to defend is it enough can Kiki scare them away fanatic they waited they've got minions I don't know if it's enough 15 seconds before chachi is that far decks getting closer kickers is trying to pull attention but he'll his sights in place he needs to have a magic magic stun but he's not going to because he's in trouble then the vid continues to focus the tyrant nearly sang is down the Nexus turret is down there on to the Nexus to the US Senate and 33 minutes fnatic it wasn't their Nexus anymore those back though that one but they're going in again oh that's a bit refine case they've got to judge you're trying to get away do you see the element of dead what can people do from beyond the grave he's caught steel back but that that is the most number of kills we've seen in the spring split 14 minutes quicker than before yellow yellow I've seen this before it happened at Worlds and it didn't go in fanatics favor will their fate be different Nexus is going down fanatical cheering we see it happen again fnatic are not able to defend the Nexus they've got supers barreling down the mid lane what can the super minions do get super winning okay okay okay the siege they are unrelenting there is one Nexus turret standing and the Kuna corn say we will have it arts fanatic or talk further with in trouble we see that kick is his truck as he was telling his absolute zero dredge line knocks up multiple people the chachi forced to use that omen of death on himself I wanna kill for steel back what can further than his steel back do 5x and power of evil alive do to see the trade side connects with he'll attack look at the calories they're both rooted in place hourglass keeps honey and alive as Lucy yellow spot taking off this is a two three versus three in the base the Nexus is standing steel back has got hella stuck he's correcting massively intifada X the violence and power of people they are pushing with the minions Mooney on full HP to Fisher will they go in place your part now this one is extremely personal to me as I've played a lot of recon mid back in the day recon mid is a seriously good pick but it used to be even better I have another little story for you so there was this time when I was smurfing through platinum and I ran into this guy who locked in recon mid on the enemy team and I'm thinking to myself well this guy's gotta be a troll this is another free win for me but he then proceeded to completely pop off this guy was the Recon mid Smurf and I thought to myself how does he do it I ended up checking his o PGG and he was like 90% win rate perk on mid he took storm Raiders surge every game and rushed proto belt into death camp this was definitely super cool so I had to look into it and recon has some of the best ap ratios in the game for his passive ap recon has a huge shield with his W he has good waveclear and damage as well as Hart CC on his E he ends up having a huge shield to help himself and allies he has great damage on his Q and the healing ap ratio is no joke either which allows him to sustain himself and his teammates the crazy thing is it used to be even better there was a time where perks was playing a lot of recon mid and inspired many people to try it out at one point myself I remember having almost an 85% win rate in diamond - as recon mid so it definitely could work if you knew what you were doing there was a patch that recon received ap ratio buffs on several abilities and he was seriously the best kept secret in mid lane and it's still surprising to me to this day that he was never truly utilized at the highest level it's been nerfed several times since those days and because of his relevance in pro play he's not nearly as opie as he used to be most notably with his RW combo having that delay it still works in modern day League of Legends it's just a shadow of its former self for a while sejuani has been a very good jungler and dominant at all levels of play because of her jungle prowess a lot of people have tried to play her in solo lanes we've seen a good bit of her in the top lane and we've even seen faker play her mid lane as a tank however none of this was quite as fun as full a piece as Hwanhee mid before sejuani received one of the major tank updates says mid was pretty nuts her ap ratios were solid and because of her ultimate being able to hit more than one enemy back then you could get nasty five-man ap Ultimates it was pretty similar to a full ap Malphite play style where it definitely does work and has a game-changing ultimate but if you don't get off the ground you'd obviously just be better off building tank right now the build still could work and you can go things like proto bail but I truthfully do think that full tank says in a solo Lane is obviously much better than full ap you can take aftershock or grasp of the undying and have great trading power and it's also pretty fun to play this is one of the more widely known items on the list today as I would assume that most people who have played League for a while know about AD Thresh the entire reason that it works has everything to do with the passive on your e play the passive on this ability is the part where if you don't auto attack for a while it kind of builds up some damage and after a couple of seconds you build up maximum damage and have this really bursty auto attack as a normal Thresh support this is pretty nice as it does let you secure a bit more kills and helps you out in damaging in some trades for ad and crit Thresh though this is totally nuts the ad ratio on this ability is one of the highest ratios in the entire game actually it might even be the highest at level 9 it scales with 200 percent of your total ad not bonus total I really don't think there are any better scalings than that but feel free to let me know if there's anything that I'm not considering such as reksai ultimate or Talon because I know those two champions also have really high ad scalings anyway the damage also scales with your souls that you collect so later on into the game the more you get the stronger this one auto-attack will be on top of that even though it scales with ad through the roof it actually does bonus magic damage making it really hard to build against you you create like crazy in your Auto alone does 500 or more physical damage because of the items that you build but then you also have a crazy amount of magic damage coming out from this and your static ship or a rapid-fire proc I'm not exactly sure what rune page I like the most with this I think lethal tempo is good and I also think that press the attack is pretty solid but dark harvest to execute people could also be extremely powerful either way this is one of those builds that still works these days and it's just as fun as ever I also think it's one of those things that seems even better than it really is simply because people don't expect the damage players are way less likely to flash away from you or respect you and get out of range of your auto attacks this is because they literally don't treat you like an ADC or know that you do that much damage since you don't really see this build very often of course if you see a Caitlyn and she places her traps you'll walk away you don't want anything to do with that however this silly Thresh walks up what's he gonna do BAM you get bopped this build has to be the shortest lasting build on our list today in terms of the time frame of its effectiveness this really only existed for like one day even with it only really being good on the PBE and it was kind of okay once irelia was released but it was never really the same ap irelia because of her rework was nasty and she had insane ratios on her release on the PBE you could make sure W or your efore waveclear and poke and you're all-in was insanely strong because of the burst actually tons of youtubers made videos about AP irelia with the rework and tried it out and they were all pretty surprised at how well it worked riot would end up changing this and people realized right away that she had insanely high ratios kind of abnormally high if this had ever hit the live servers in that same state and people were able to optimize the build over a number of weeks this probably would have been the best irelia build with the rework this definitely isn't good anymore but from what I understand I believe this build is still quite good in earth and I've heard that earth is coming back pretty soon so you might be able to whip out the AP irelia once again speaking of ad champions building AP AP rengar was one of the most terrifying and electric things to ever shock the League of Legends scene he was a monster of an assassin after he got a little bit of a mini rework where you could max your W and if you snowballed hard enough become an AP one-shotting machine that was a o e this is arguably the best AoE assassin in history as it didn't have the single highest burst on a single target but you could blow up groups of enemies that were around 60 or 70% health from stealth which is extremely unfair the build was good it definitely worked but it was never really more than a gimmick because it obviously would have some clear weaknesses if it were ever to be tried out in a competitive game it had a much worse clear than ad rank R because you're building AP and maxing W and AP items cost a lot so you really needed to snowball but hey AP kitties were still rampant for some time this has to be the funniest build on the list today AAP ala star toppling now it's no secret that the cow has some good ap ratios on him if you consider that he does have CC similar to rock on you can kind of make it work as more of a supportive ap champion similar to recon and Morgana middling the problem is that you have much worse ways clear your trading pattern is a bit weird because if you ever get caught with your head but someone can run you down and you're very vulnerable to getting ganked despite this back in 2016 there was one player who changed everything in a video that would make the front page of Reddit and have hundreds of thousands of eyes see it doublelift would be obliterated by an AP al star top lane player doublelift would play four games that day with him one with him on his team which they won and three against him which he lost all three times apparently this was actually Adrian Riven the Challenger Riven main playing ap Alistar top lane double if stream with tens of thousands of viewers would watch the terror that was AP Alistar top lane inspiring a lot of players in the community to try it out back then this build worked even better than it does now this was during the days of League of thunderlord's when it was really the only Keystone that anyone would ever take also his first item was actually frost Queens claim which was the support item this had the active that twin shadows does today allowing you to pop the spooky ghosts and then when they are slowed you can catch up to them and combo them I tried it out recently and these days it's obviously not as good the problem is that electrocute is really what you have to take but you don't really want it and then if anyone ever has bone plating or nullifying orb you can never kill anyone I think he can still work and it's just as fun as it was back then but this guy had a great setup that could let him smash games even in Challenger finally we reach the last thing on our list and it's a very very special topic one of the main draws to League of Legends when you're brand new to the game is the idea that you have infinite and unlimited choice in your decisions and whatever choices you want to make seem like you can always make it work when you start playing League of Legends in those pre level 30 games unless you have a very experienced player yelling in your ear every game on exactly what to build exactly what to do and exactly how to play to the meta you don't really know any better who's to say that Garen jungle doesn't work who's to say that full life steel locks doesn't work you certainly haven't seen it yet in your games and if you haven't seen it that just means other people haven't figured it out and for us all one of the greatest and most innovative strategies that has achieved meme level status is River Shen River Shen is not a rune page or a built or an idea it's a roll it's a play style it's a philosophy in an approach to the game River Shen is when you literally are not jungle you are River you wait in the river clear Ward's place your own wards and gank lanes non-stop until it works you don't bother laning clearing the jungle no you just walk into the lane and kill them you're like a permanently roaming support you're not a jungler you are River River Shen [Music] that ladies and gentlemen is going to wrap it up for today's video if you enjoyed this one make sure to leave a like and click subscribe
